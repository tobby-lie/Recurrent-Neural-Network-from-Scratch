              "'THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND\\n\\nby Jules Verne\\n\\n1874\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART 1--DROPPED FROM THE CLOUDS\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\n“Are we rising again?” “No. On the contrary.” “Are we descending?”\\n “Worse than that, captain! we are falling!” “For Heaven’s sake heave out\\nthe ballast!” “There! the last sack is empty!” “Does the balloon rise?”\\n “No!” “I hear a noise like the dashing of waves. The sea is below the\\ncar! It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!” “Overboard with every\\nweight! ... everything!”\\n\\nSuch were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air,\\nabove the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four o’clock in the\\nevening of the 23rd of March, 1865.\\n\\nFew can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast,\\nin the middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest raged without\\nintermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were\\nterrible in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a distance of eighteen\\nhundred miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the\\nthirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel. Towns were\\noverthrown, forests uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of\\nwater which were precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which\\nthe published accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled\\nby waterspouts which destroyed everything they passed over, several\\nthousand people crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces\\nof its fury, left by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters\\nthose which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the 25th\\nof October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.\\n\\nBut while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a\\ndrama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.\\n\\nIn fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a\\nwaterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of\\nair and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning\\nround and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.\\n\\nBeneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five\\npassengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled\\nwith spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.\\n\\nWhence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From\\nwhat part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started\\nduring the storm. But the storm had raged five days already, and the\\nfirst symptoms were manifested on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that\\nthe balloon came from a great distance, for it could not have traveled\\nless than two thousand miles in twenty-four hours.\\n\\nAt any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance,\\ncould not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed\\nsince their departure. It was a remarkable fact that, although in the\\nvery midst of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it. They\\nwere thrown about and whirled round and round without feeling the\\nrotation in the slightest degree, or being sensible that they were\\nremoved from a horizontal position.\\n\\nTheir eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered\\nbeneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density\\nof the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or\\nnight. No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring\\nof the ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while\\nsuspended in those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone had\\ninformed them of the dangers which they ran from the waves. However,\\nthe balloon, lightened of heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and\\nprovisions, had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a\\nheight of 4,500 feet. The voyagers, after having discovered that the sea\\nextended beneath them, and thinking the dangers above less dreadful than\\nthose below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful\\narticles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life\\nof their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss.\\n\\nThe night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to\\nless energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest\\nbegan to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March,\\nit showed symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had\\nrisen into the more lofty regions of the air. In a few hours the wind\\nhad changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate\\nof the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half. It\\nwas still what sailors call “a close-reefed topsail breeze,” but the\\ncommotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished.\\n\\nTowards eleven o’clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly\\nclearer. The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt\\nafter the passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone\\nfarther to the west. It appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have\\npassed away in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to\\nthe typhoons of the Indian Ocean?\\n\\nBut at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again\\nslowly descending with a regular movement. It appeared as if it were,\\nlittle by little, collapsing, and that its case was lengthening and\\nextending, passing from a spherical to an oval form. Towards midday the\\nballoon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet. It\\ncontained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity, it\\ncould maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a\\ngreat altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position.\\n\\nPerceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles\\nwhich still weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept,\\neverything, even to their pocket-knives, and one of them, having hoisted\\nhimself on to the circles which united the cords of the net, tried to\\nsecure more firmly the lower point of the balloon.\\n\\nIt was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and\\nthat the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions.\\nThey must infallibly perish!\\n\\nThere was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them.\\nThe watery expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid\\nsurface upon which their anchor could hold.\\n\\nIt was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous\\nviolence! It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those\\nwhose gaze, from their commanding position, extended over a radius of\\nforty miles. The vast liquid plain, lashed without mercy by the storm,\\nappeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers, whose white and\\ndisheveled crests were streaming in the wind. No land was in sight, not\\na solitary ship could be seen. It was necessary at any cost to arrest\\ntheir downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in\\nthe waves. The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work.\\nBut, notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the\\nsame time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the direction of\\nthe wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the southwest.\\n\\nFrightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men. They were\\nevidently no longer masters of the machine. All their attempts were\\nuseless. The case of the balloon collapsed more and more. The gas\\nescaped without any possibility of retaining it. Their descent was\\nvisibly accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within 600 feet\\nof the ocean.\\n\\nIt was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a\\nlarge rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the articles which\\nit contained, the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension\\nin the air for a few hours. But the inevitable catastrophe could only\\nbe retarded, and if land did not appear before night, voyagers, car, and\\nballoon must to a certainty vanish beneath the waves.\\n\\nThey now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were truly\\ndauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a single\\nmurmur escaped from their lips. They were determined to struggle to the\\nlast minute, to do anything to retard their fall. The car was only a\\nsort of willow basket, unable to float, and there was not the slightest\\npossibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea.\\n\\nTwo more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the\\nwater.\\n\\nAt that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was\\ninaccessible to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not\\nless determined. “Is everything thrown out?” “No, here are still 2,000\\ndollars in gold.” A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea. “Does\\nthe balloon rise?” “A little, but it will not be long before it falls\\nagain.” “What still remains to be thrown out?” “Nothing.” “Yes! the\\ncar!” “Let us catch hold of the net, and into the sea with the car.”\\n\\nThis was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon.\\nThe ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall,\\nmounted 2,000 feet. The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the\\nnet, and clung to the meshes, gazing at the abyss.\\n\\nThe delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is sufficient to\\nthrow out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical\\nposition. The apparatus in the air is like a balance of mathematical\\nprecision. It can be thus easily understood that when it is lightened of\\nany considerable weight its movement will be impetuous and sudden. So\\nit happened on this occasion. But after being suspended for an instant\\naloft, the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent\\nwhich it was impossible to repair.\\n\\nThe men had done all that men could do. No human efforts could save them\\nnow.\\n\\nThey must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements.\\n\\nAt four o’clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the\\nwater.\\n\\nA loud barking was heard. A dog accompanied the voyagers, and was held\\npressed close to his master in the meshes of the net.\\n\\n“Top has seen something,” cried one of the men. Then immediately a loud\\nvoice shouted,--\\n\\n“Land! land!” The balloon, which the wind still drove towards the\\nsouthwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance, which might\\nbe reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in\\nfact, appeared in that direction. But this land was still thirty miles\\noff. It would not take less than an hour to get to it, and then there\\nwas the chance of falling to leeward.\\n\\nAn hour! Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid\\nit yet retained?\\n\\nSuch was the terrible question! The voyagers could distinctly see that\\nsolid spot which they must reach at any cost. They were ignorant of what\\nit was, whether an island or a continent, for they did not know to what\\npart of the world the hurricane had driven them. But they must reach\\nthis land, whether inhabited or desolate, whether hospitable or not.\\n\\nIt was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself! Several\\ntimes already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom\\nof the net, making it still heavier, and the balloon only half rose,\\nlike a bird with a wounded wing. Half an hour later the land was not\\nmore than a mile off, but the balloon, exhausted, flabby, hanging in\\ngreat folds, had gas in its upper part alone. The voyagers, clinging to\\nthe net, were still too heavy for it, and soon, half plunged into the\\nsea, they were beaten by the furious waves. The balloon-case bulged out\\nagain, and the wind, taking it, drove it along like a vessel. Might it\\nnot possibly thus reach the land?\\n\\nBut, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from four pairs\\nof lungs at once. The balloon, which had appeared as if it would never\\nagain rise, suddenly made an unexpected bound, after having been struck\\nby a tremendous sea. As if it had been at that instant relieved of a new\\npart of its weight, it mounted to a height of 1,500 feet, and here it\\nmet a current of wind, which instead of taking it directly to the coast,\\ncarried it in a nearly parallel direction.\\n\\nAt last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally fell on\\na sandy beach, out of the reach of the waves.\\n\\nThe voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves from\\nthe meshes of the net. The balloon, relieved of their weight, was taken\\nby the wind, and like a wounded bird which revives for an instant,\\ndisappeared into space.\\n\\nBut the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the balloon\\nonly left four on the shore.\\n\\nThe missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea, which had\\njust struck the net, and it was owing to this circumstance that the\\nlightened balloon rose the last time, and then soon after reached the\\nland. Scarcely had the four castaways set foot on firm ground, than they\\nall, thinking of the absent one, simultaneously exclaimed, “Perhaps he\\nwill try to swim to land! Let us save him! let us save him!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\nThose whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were neither\\naeronauts by profession nor amateurs. They were prisoners of war whose\\nboldness had induced them to escape in this extraordinary manner.\\n\\nA hundred times they had almost perished! A hundred times had they\\nalmost fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean. But\\nHeaven had reserved them for a strange destiny, and after having, on the\\n20th of March, escaped from Richmond, besieged by the troops of General\\nUlysses Grant, they found themselves seven thousand miles from the\\ncapital of Virginia, which was the principal stronghold of the South,\\nduring the terrible War of Secession. Their aerial voyage had lasted\\nfive days.\\n\\nThe curious circumstances which led to the escape of the prisoners were\\nas follows:\\n\\nThat same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the coups\\nde main by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to possess\\nhimself of Richmond, several of his officers fell into the power of the\\nenemy and were detained in the town. One of the most distinguished was\\nCaptain Cyrus Harding. He was a native of Massachusetts, a first-class\\nengineer, to whom the government had confided, during the war, the\\ndirection of the railways, which were so important at that time. A\\ntrue Northerner, thin, bony, lean, about forty-five years of age; his\\nclose-cut hair and his beard, of which he only kept a thick mustache,\\nwere already getting gray. He had one-of those finely-developed heads\\nwhich appear made to be struck on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious\\nmouth, the physiognomy of a clever man of the military school. He was\\none of those engineers who began by handling the hammer and pickaxe,\\nlike generals who first act as common soldiers. Besides mental power, he\\nalso possessed great manual dexterity. His muscles exhibited remarkable\\nproofs of tenacity. A man of action as well as a man of thought, all he\\ndid was without effort to one of his vigorous and sanguine temperament.\\nLearned, clear-headed, and practical, he fulfilled in all\\nemergencies those three conditions which united ought to insure human\\nsuccess--activity of mind and body, impetuous wishes, and powerful will.\\nHe might have taken for his motto that of William of Orange in the 17th\\ncentury: “I can undertake and persevere even without hope of success.”\\n Cyrus Harding was courage personified. He had been in all the battles of\\nthat war. After having begun as a volunteer at Illinois, under Ulysses\\nGrant, he fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg Landing, at the siege of\\nCorinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga, the Wilderness, on the\\nPotomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy of the general who\\nsaid, “I never count my dead!” And hundreds of times Captain Harding had\\nalmost been among those who were not counted by the terrible Grant; but\\nin these combats where he never spared himself, fortune favored him till\\nthe moment when he was wounded and taken prisoner on the field of battle\\nnear Richmond. At the same time and on the same day another important\\npersonage fell into the hands of the Southerners. This was no other than\\nGideon Spilett, a reporter for the New York Herald, who had been ordered\\nto follow the changes of the war in the midst of the Northern armies.\\n\\nGideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American\\nchroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain\\nexact information, and transmit it to their journal in the shortest\\npossible time. The newspapers of the Union, such as the New York Herald,\\nare genuine powers, and their reporters are men to be reckoned with.\\nGideon Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters: a man of great\\nmerit, energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas, having\\ntraveled over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in\\ncouncil, resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor\\ndanger, when in pursuit of information, for himself first, and then for\\nhis journal, a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious\\nsubjects, of the unpublished, of the unknown, and of the impossible. He\\nwas one of those intrepid observers who write under fire, “reporting”\\n among bullets, and to whom every danger is welcome.\\n\\nHe also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver in one\\nhand, note-book in the other; grape-shot never made his pencil tremble.\\nHe did not fatigue the wires with incessant telegrams, like those who\\nspeak when they have nothing to say, but each of his notes, short,\\ndecisive, and clear, threw light on some important point. Besides, he\\nwas not wanting in humor. It was he who, after the affair of the Black\\nRiver, determined at any cost to keep his place at the wicket of the\\ntelegraph office, and after having announced to his journal the result\\nof the battle, telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the\\nBible. It cost the New York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New\\nYork Herald published the first intelligence.\\n\\nGideon Spilett was tall. He was rather more than forty years of age.\\nLight whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye was steady,\\nlively, rapid in its changes. It was the eye of a man accustomed to take\\nin at a glance all the details of a scene. Well built, he was inured to\\nall climates, like a bar of steel hardened in cold water.\\n\\nFor ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New York\\nHerald, which he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he was as\\nskilful in the use of the pencil as of the pen. When he was captured,\\nhe was in the act of making a description and sketch of the battle. The\\nlast words in his note-book were these: “A Southern rifleman has just\\ntaken aim at me, but--” The Southerner notwithstanding missed Gideon\\nSpilett, who, with his usual fortune, came out of this affair without a\\nscratch.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other except\\nby reputation, had both been carried to Richmond. The engineer’s\\nwounds rapidly healed, and it was during his convalescence that he made\\nacquaintance with the reporter. The two men then learned to appreciate\\neach other. Soon their common aim had but one object, that of escaping,\\nrejoining Grant’s army, and fighting together in the ranks of the\\nFederals.\\n\\nThe two Americans had from the first determined to seize every chance;\\nbut although they were allowed to wander at liberty in the town,\\nRichmond was so strictly guarded, that escape appeared impossible. In\\nthe meanwhile Captain Harding was rejoined by a servant who was devoted\\nto him in life and in death. This intrepid fellow was a Negro born on\\nthe engineer’s estate, of a slave father and mother, but to whom Cyrus,\\nwho was an Abolitionist from conviction and heart, had long since given\\nhis freedom. The once slave, though free, would not leave his master. He\\nwould have died for him. He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active,\\nclever, intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry,\\nobliging, and honest. His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only answered\\nto the familiar abbreviation of Neb.\\n\\nWhen Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left\\nMassachusetts without hesitating an instant, arrived before Richmond,\\nand by dint of stratagem and shrewdness, after having risked his life\\ntwenty times over, managed to penetrate into the besieged town. The\\npleasure of Harding on seeing his servant, and the joy of Neb at finding\\nhis master, can scarcely be described.\\n\\nBut though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it was quite\\nanother thing to get out again, for the Northern prisoners were very\\nstrictly watched. Some extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the\\nattempt with any chance of success, and this opportunity not only did\\nnot present itself, but was very difficult to find.\\n\\nMeanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations. The victory of\\nPetersburg had been very dearly bought. His forces, united to those of\\nButler, had as yet been unsuccessful before Richmond, and nothing gave\\nthe prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance.\\n\\nThe reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single\\nincident worthy of note, could stand it no longer. His usually active\\nmind was occupied with one sole thought--how he might get out of\\nRichmond at any cost. Several times had he even made the attempt,\\nbut was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle. However, the siege\\ncontinued; and if the prisoners were anxious to escape and join Grant’s\\narmy, certain of the besieged were no less anxious to join the Southern\\nforces. Among them was one Jonathan Forster, a determined Southerner.\\nThe truth was, that if the prisoners of the Secessionists could not\\nleave the town, neither could the Secessionists themselves while the\\nNorthern army invested it. The Governor of Richmond for a long time had\\nbeen unable to communicate with General Lee, and he very much wished to\\nmake known to him the situation of the town, so as to hasten the march\\nof the army to their relief. Thus Jonathan Forster accordingly conceived\\nthe idea of rising in a balloon, so as to pass over the besieging lines,\\nand in that way reach the Secessionist camp.\\n\\nThe Governor authorized the attempt. A balloon was manufactured and\\nplaced at the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by five\\nother persons. They were furnished with arms in case they might have\\nto defend themselves when they alighted, and provisions in the event of\\ntheir aerial voyage being prolonged.\\n\\nThe departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March. It should\\nbe effected during the night, with a northwest wind of moderate force,\\nand the aeronauts calculated that they would reach General Lee’s camp in\\na few hours.\\n\\nBut this northwest wind was not a simple breeze. From the 18th it was\\nevident that it was changing to a hurricane. The tempest soon became\\nsuch that Forster’s departure was deferred, for it was impossible to\\nrisk the balloon and those whom it carried in the midst of the furious\\nelements.\\n\\nThe balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready to\\ndepart on the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be supposed, the\\nimpatience among the besieged to see the storm moderate was very great.\\n\\nThe 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the\\nweather. There was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon fastened\\nto the ground, as the squalls dashed it furiously about.\\n\\nThe night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm blew with\\nredoubled force. The departure of the balloon was impossible.\\n\\nOn that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of the\\nstreets of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least know. This\\nwas a sailor named Pencroft, a man of about thirty-five or forty years\\nof age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of\\nbright sparkling eyes and a remarkably good physiognomy. Pencroft was an\\nAmerican from the North, who had sailed all the ocean over, and who had\\ngone through every possible and almost impossible adventure that a being\\nwith two feet and no wings would encounter. It is needless to say that\\nhe was a bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished\\nat nothing. Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond\\non business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a\\nformer captain, an orphan, whom he loved as if he had been his\\nown child. Not having been able to leave the town before the first\\noperations of the siege, he found himself shut up, to his great disgust;\\nbut, not accustomed to succumb to difficulties, he resolved to escape by\\nsome means or other. He knew the engineer-officer by reputation; he knew\\nwith what impatience that determined man chafed under his restraint. On\\nthis day he did not, therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without\\ncircumlocution, “Have you had enough of Richmond, captain?”\\n\\nThe engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added, in a\\nlow voice,--\\n\\n“Captain Harding, will you try to escape?”\\n\\n“When?” asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this\\nquestion was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet examined\\nthe stranger who addressed him. But after having with a penetrating\\neye observed the open face of the sailor, he was convinced that he had\\nbefore him an honest man.\\n\\n“Who are you?” he asked briefly.\\n\\nPencroft made himself known.\\n\\n“Well,” replied Harding, “and in what way do you propose to escape?”\\n\\n“By that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and which looks\\nto me as if it was waiting on purpose for us--”\\n\\nThere was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence. The\\nengineer understood him at once. He seized Pencroft by the arm, and\\ndragged him to his house. There the sailor developed his project, which\\nwas indeed extremely simple. They risked nothing but their lives in its\\nexecution. The hurricane was in all its violence, it is true, but so\\nclever and daring an engineer as Cyrus Harding knew perfectly well how\\nto manage a balloon. Had he himself been as well acquainted with the art\\nof sailing in the air as he was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft\\nwould not have hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend\\nHerbert with him; for, accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the\\nocean, he was not to be hindered on account of the hurricane.\\n\\nCaptain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a word,\\nbut his eyes shone with satisfaction. Here was the long-sought-for\\nopportunity--he was not a man to let it pass. The plan was feasible,\\nthough, it must be confessed, dangerous in the extreme. In the night,\\nin spite of their guards, they might approach the balloon, slip into the\\ncar, and then cut the cords which held it. There was no doubt that they\\nmight be killed, but on the other hand they might succeed, and without\\nthis storm!--Without this storm the balloon would have started already\\nand the looked-for opportunity would not have then presented itself.\\n\\n“I am not alone!” said Harding at last.\\n\\n“How many people do you wish to bring with you?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“Two; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb.”\\n\\n“That will be three,” replied Pencroft; “and with Herbert and me five.\\nBut the balloon will hold six--”\\n\\n“That will be enough, we will go,” answered Harding in a firm voice.\\n\\nThis “we” included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well knew,\\nwas not a man to draw back, and when the project was communicated to him\\nhe approved of it unreservedly. What astonished him was, that so simple\\nan idea had not occurred to him before. As to Neb, he followed his\\nmaster wherever his master wished to go.\\n\\n“This evening, then,” said Pencroft, “we will all meet out there.”\\n\\n“This evening, at ten o’clock,” replied Captain Harding; “and Heaven\\ngrant that the storm does not abate before our departure.”\\n\\nPencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his lodging,\\nwhere young Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy knew of the\\nsailor’s plan, and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result\\nof the proposal being made to the engineer. Thus five determined\\npersons were about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous\\nelements!\\n\\nNo! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor his\\ncompanions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.\\n\\nIt would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one thing; it\\nwas that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about by the\\nwind, would be torn into shreds. For several hours he roamed round the\\nnearly-deserted square, surveying the apparatus. Pencroft did the same\\non his side, his hands in his pockets, yawning now and then like a man\\nwho did not know how to kill the time, but really dreading, like\\nhis friend, either the escape or destruction of the balloon. Evening\\narrived. The night was dark in the extreme. Thick mists passed like\\nclouds close to the ground. Rain fell mingled with snow, it was very\\ncold. A mist hung over Richmond. It seemed as if the violent storm had\\nproduced a truce between the besiegers and the besieged, and that the\\ncannon were silenced by the louder detonations of the storm. The streets\\nof the town were deserted. It had not even appeared necessary in that\\nhorrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of which\\nplunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of the prisoners,\\nbut what might possibly be the termination of the hazardous voyage they\\ncontemplated in the midst of the furious elements?--\\n\\n“Dirty weather!” exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on his head\\nwith a blow of his fist; “but pshaw, we shall succeed all the same!”\\n\\nAt half-past nine, Harding and his companions glided from different\\ndirections into the square, which the gas-lamps, extinguished by the\\nwind, had left in total obscurity. Even the enormous balloon, almost\\nbeaten to the ground, could not be seen. Independently of the sacks of\\nballast, to which the cords of the net were fastened, the car was\\nheld by a strong cable passed through a ring in the pavement. The five\\nprisoners met by the car. They had not been perceived, and such was the\\ndarkness that they could not even see each other.\\n\\nWithout speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their\\nplaces in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer’s order detached\\nsuccessively the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few minutes only,\\nand the sailor rejoined his companions.\\n\\nThe balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer had\\nnothing to do but to give the word.\\n\\nAt that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was Top,\\na favorite of the engineer. The faithful creature, having broken his\\nchain, had followed his master. He, however, fearing that its additional\\nweight might impede their ascent, wished to send away the animal.\\n\\n“One more will make but little difference, poor beast!” exclaimed\\nPencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke letting go the\\ncable; the balloon ascending in an oblique direction, disappeared, after\\nhaving dashed the car against two chimneys, which it threw down as it\\nswept by them.\\n\\nThen, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to the\\nvoyagers. During the night the engineer could not dream of descending,\\nand when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below was intercepted by\\nfog.\\n\\nFive days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see the\\nwide extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the maddest\\nfury by the gale.\\n\\nOur readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals\\nwho set out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of\\nMarch. Five days afterwards four of them were thrown on a desert coast,\\nseven thousand miles from their country! But one of their number was\\nmissing, the man who was to be their guide, their leading spirit, the\\nengineer, Captain Harding! The instant they had recovered their feet,\\nthey all hurried to the beach in the hopes of rendering him assistance.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\nThe engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been carried\\noff by a wave. His dog also had disappeared. The faithful animal\\nhad voluntarily leaped out to help his master. “Forward,” cried the\\nreporter; and all four, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb, forgetting\\ntheir fatigue, began their search. Poor Neb shed bitter tears, giving\\nway to despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on\\nearth.\\n\\nOnly two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding disappeared\\nto the moment when his companions set foot on the ground. They had hopes\\ntherefore of arriving in time to save him. “Let us look for him! let us\\nlook for him!” cried Neb.\\n\\n“Yes, Neb,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and we will find him too!”\\n\\n“Living, I trust!”\\n\\n“Still living!”\\n\\n“Can he swim?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Neb, “and besides, Top is there.”\\n\\nThe sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his head.\\n\\nThe engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and nearly half\\na mile from the place where the castaways had landed. The nearest point\\nof the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off.\\n\\nIt was then nearly six o’clock. A thick fog made the night very dark.\\nThe castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had\\nthrown them, an unknown region, the geographical situation of which they\\ncould not even guess. They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with\\nstones, which appeared destitute of any sort of vegetation. The ground,\\nvery unequal and rough, was in some places perfectly riddled with holes,\\nmaking walking extremely painful. From these holes escaped every minute\\ngreat birds of clumsy flight, which flew in all directions. Others, more\\nactive, rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads. The sailor\\nthought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose\\nabove the roaring of the sea.\\n\\nFrom time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for\\nsome response from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had\\nlanded, and they had been near to the place, they would have heard the\\nbarking of the dog Top, even should Harding himself have been unable to\\ngive any sign of existence. They stopped to listen, but no sound arose\\nabove the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf. The little\\nband then continued their march forward, searching into every hollow of\\nthe shore.\\n\\nAfter walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were suddenly\\nbrought to a standstill by the sight of foaming billows close to\\ntheir feet. The solid ground ended here. They found themselves at the\\nextremity of a sharp point on which the sea broke furiously.\\n\\n“It is a promontory,” said the sailor; “we must retrace our steps,\\nholding towards the right, and we shall thus gain the mainland.”\\n\\n“But if he is there,” said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose waves shone\\nof a snowy white in the darkness. “Well, let us call again,” and all\\nuniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout, but there came no\\nreply. They waited for a lull, then began again; still no reply.\\n\\nThe castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side of the\\npromontory, over a soil equally sandy and rugged. However, Pencroft\\nobserved that the shore was more equal, that the ground rose, and he\\ndeclared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill, whose massive\\nfront he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the\\nmist. The birds were less numerous on this part of the shore; the sea\\nwas also less tumultuous, and they observed that the agitation of the\\nwaves was diminished. The noise of the surf was scarcely heard. This\\nside of the promontory evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the\\nsharp point sheltered from the breakers of the open sea. But to follow\\nthis direction was to go south, exactly opposite to that part of the\\ncoast where Harding might have landed. After a walk of a mile and a\\nhalf, the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to\\nthe north. This promontory, of which they had turned the point, must\\nbe attached to the mainland. The castaways, although their strength\\nwas nearly exhausted, still marched courageously forward, hoping every\\nmoment to meet with a sudden angle which would set them in the first\\ndirection. What was their disappointment, when, after trudging nearly\\ntwo miles, having reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks,\\nthey found themselves again stopped by the sea.\\n\\n“We are on an islet,” said Pencroft, “and we have surveyed it from one\\nextremity to the other.”\\n\\nThe sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent, not\\neven on an island, but on an islet which was not more than two miles in\\nlength, with even a less breadth.\\n\\nWas this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea-birds, strewn with\\nstones and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more important\\narchipelago? It was impossible to say. When the voyagers from their car\\nsaw the land through the mist, they had not been able to reconnoiter\\nit sufficiently. However, Pencroft, accustomed with his sailor eyes\\nto piece through the gloom, was almost certain that he could clearly\\ndistinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated\\ncoast. But they could not in the dark determine whether it was a single\\nisland, or connected with others. They could not leave it either, as the\\nsea surrounded them; they must therefore put off till the next day their\\nsearch for the engineer, from whom, alas! not a single cry had reached\\nthem to show that he was still in existence.\\n\\n“The silence of our friend proves nothing,” said the reporter. “Perhaps\\nhe has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply directly, so we will\\nnot despair.”\\n\\nThe reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet,\\nwhich would serve as a signal to the engineer. But they searched in vain\\nfor wood or dry brambles; nothing but sand and stones were to be found.\\nThe grief of Neb and his companions, who were all strongly attached to\\nthe intrepid Harding, can be better pictured than described. It was too\\nevident that they were powerless to help him. They must wait with what\\npatience they could for daylight. Either the engineer had been able to\\nsave himself, and had already found a refuge on some point of the coast,\\nor he was lost for ever! The long and painful hours passed by. The cold\\nwas intense. The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely perceived\\nit. They did not even think of taking a minute’s rest. Forgetting\\neverything but their chief, hoping or wishing to hope on, they continued\\nto walk up and down on this sterile spot, always returning to its\\nnorthern point, where they could approach nearest to the scene of the\\ncatastrophe. They listened, they called, and then uniting their voices,\\nthey endeavored to raise even a louder shout than before, which would\\nbe transmitted to a great distance. The wind had now fallen almost to\\na calm, and the noise of the sea began also to subside. One of Neb’s\\nshouts even appeared to produce an echo. Herbert directed Pencroft’s\\nattention to it, adding, “That proves that there is a coast to the west,\\nat no great distance.” The sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not\\ndeceive him. If he had discovered land, however indistinct it might\\nappear, land was sure to be there. But that distant echo was the only\\nresponse produced by Neb’s shouts, while a heavy gloom hung over all the\\npart east of the island.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the sky was clearing little by little. Towards midnight the\\nstars shone out, and if the engineer had been there with his companions\\nhe would have remarked that these stars did not belong to the Northern\\nHemisphere. The Polar Star was not visible, the constellations were not\\nthose which they had been accustomed to see in the United States; the\\nSouthern Cross glittered brightly in the sky.\\n\\nThe night passed away. Towards five o’clock in the morning of the 25th\\nof March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still remained dark,\\nbut with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so that the eye could\\nscarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood. At\\nlength the fog gradually unrolled itself in great heavily moving waves.\\n\\nIt was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could distinguish\\nnothing around them. While the gaze of the reporter and Neb were cast\\nupon the ocean, the sailor and Herbert looked eagerly for the coast\\nin the west. But not a speck of land was visible. “Never mind,” said\\nPencroft, “though I do not see the land, I feel it... it is there...\\nthere... as sure as the fact that we are no longer at Richmond.” But the\\nfog was not long in rising. It was only a fine-weather mist. A hot\\nsun soon penetrated to the surface of the island. About half-past\\nsix, three-quarters of an hour after sunrise, the mist became more\\ntransparent. It grew thicker above, but cleared away below. Soon the\\nisle appeared as if it had descended from a cloud, then the sea showed\\nitself around them, spreading far away towards the east, but bounded on\\nthe west by an abrupt and precipitous coast.\\n\\nYes! the land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally\\ninsured. The islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half\\na mile in breadth, through which rushed an extremely rapid current.\\n\\nHowever, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his heart,\\nimmediately threw himself into the current, without consulting his\\ncompanions, without saying a single word. It was Neb. He was in haste\\nto be on the other side, and to climb towards the north. It had been\\nimpossible to hold him back. Pencroft called him in vain. The reporter\\nprepared to follow him, but Pencroft stopped him. “Do you want to cross\\nthe channel?” he asked. “Yes,” replied Spilett. “All right!” said the\\nseaman; “wait a bit; Neb is well able to carry help to his master. If we\\nventure into the channel, we risk being carried into the open sea by\\nthe current, which is running very strong; but, if I’m not wrong, it is\\nebbing. See, the tide is going down over the sand. Let us have patience,\\nand at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage.” “You\\nare right,” replied the reporter, “we will not separate more than we can\\nhelp.”\\n\\nDuring this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the current. He\\nwas crossing in an oblique direction. His black shoulders could be seen\\nemerging at each stroke. He was carried down very quickly, but he also\\nmade way towards the shore. It took more than half an hour to cross from\\nthe islet to the land, and he reached the shore several hundred feet\\nfrom the place which was opposite to the point from which he had\\nstarted.\\n\\nLanding at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself\\nvigorously; and then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind\\na rocky point, which projected to nearly the height of the northern\\nextremity of the islet.\\n\\nNeb’s companions had watched his daring attempt with painful anxiety,\\nand when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention on the land\\nwhere their hope of safety lay, while eating some shell-fish with which\\nthe sand was strewn. It was a wretched repast, but still it was better\\nthan nothing. The opposite coast formed one vast bay, terminating on the\\nsouth by a very sharp point, which was destitute of all vegetation,\\nand was of a very wild aspect. This point abutted on the shore in a\\ngrotesque outline of high granite rocks. Towards the north, on the\\ncontrary, the bay widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending\\nfrom the southwest to the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape.\\nThe distance between these two extremities, which made the bow of the\\nbay, was about eight miles. Half a mile from the shore rose the islet,\\nwhich somewhat resembled the carcass of a gigantic whale. Its extreme\\nbreadth was not more than a quarter of a mile.\\n\\nOpposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered with\\nblack stones, which were now appearing little by little above the\\nretreating tide. The second level was separated by a perpendicular\\ngranite cliff, terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of\\nat least 300 feet. It continued thus for a length of three miles, ending\\nsuddenly on the right with a precipice which looked as if cut by the\\nhand of man. On the left, above the promontory, this irregular and\\njagged cliff descended by a long slope of conglomerated rocks till it\\nmingled with the ground of the southern point. On the upper plateau of\\nthe coast not a tree appeared. It was a flat tableland like that above\\nCape Town at the Cape of Good Hope, but of reduced proportions; at least\\nso it appeared seen from the islet. However, verdure was not wanting to\\nthe right beyond the precipice. They could easily distinguish a confused\\nmass of great trees, which extended beyond the limits of their view.\\nThis verdure relieved the eye, so long wearied by the continued ranges\\nof granite. Lastly, beyond and above the plateau, in a northwesterly\\ndirection and at a distance of at least seven miles, glittered a white\\nsummit which reflected the sun’s rays. It was that of a lofty mountain,\\ncapped with snow.\\n\\nThe question could not at present be decided whether this land formed\\nan island, or whether it belonged to a continent. But on beholding\\nthe convulsed masses heaped up on the left, no geologist would have\\nhesitated to give them a volcanic origin, for they were unquestionably\\nthe work of subterranean convulsions.\\n\\nGideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this land, on\\nwhich they might perhaps have to live many long years; on which indeed\\nthey might even die, should it be out of the usual track of vessels, as\\nwas likely to be the case.\\n\\n“Well,” asked Herbert, “what do you say, Pencroft?”\\n\\n“There is some good and some bad, as in everything,” replied the sailor.\\n“We shall see. But now the ebb is evidently making. In three hours we\\nwill attempt the passage, and once on the other side, we will try to get\\nout of this scrape, and I hope may find the captain.” Pencroft was not\\nwrong in his anticipations. Three hours later at low tide, the greater\\npart of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered. Between\\nthe islet and the coast there only remained a narrow channel which would\\nno doubt be easy to cross.\\n\\nAbout ten o’clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped themselves\\nof their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their heads, and\\nthen ventured into the water, which was not more than five feet deep.\\nHerbert, for whom it was too deep, swam like a fish, and got through\\ncapitally. All three arrived without difficulty on the opposite shore.\\nQuickly drying themselves in the sun, they put on their clothes, which\\nthey had preserved from contact with the water, and sat down to take\\ncounsel together what to do next.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\nAll at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that he would\\nrejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in the direction\\nwhich the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before. Anxiety hastened\\nhis steps, for he longed to obtain news of his friend, and he soon\\ndisappeared round an angle of the cliff. Herbert wished to accompany\\nhim.\\n\\n“Stop here, my boy,” said the sailor; “we have to prepare an encampment,\\nand to try and find rather better grub than these shell-fish. Our\\nfriends will want something when they come back. There is work for\\neverybody.”\\n\\n“I am ready,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“All right,” said the sailor; “that will do. We must set about it\\nregularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must have\\nshelter, fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs in nests;\\nwe have only to find a house.”\\n\\n“Very well,” returned Herbert, “I will look for a cave among the rocks,\\nand I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep.”\\n\\n“All right,” said Pencroft; “go on, my boy.”\\n\\nThey both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach, far\\nfrom which the tide had now retreated; but instead of going towards the\\nnorth, they went southward. Pencroft had remarked, several hundred feet\\nfrom the place at which they landed, a narrow cutting, out of which\\nhe thought a river or stream might issue. Now, on the one hand it was\\nimportant to settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good stream\\nof water, and on the other it was possible that the current had thrown\\nCyrus Harding on the shore there.\\n\\nThe cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet, but\\nthe mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base, scarcely washed\\nby the sea, it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as\\na dwelling. It was a perpendicular wall of very hard granite, which even\\nthe waves had not worn away. Towards the summit fluttered myriads of\\nsea-fowl, and especially those of the web-footed species with long,\\nflat, pointed beaks--a clamorous tribe, bold in the presence of man,\\nwho probably for the first time thus invaded their domains. Pencroft\\nrecognized the skua and other gulls among them, the voracious little\\nsea-mew, which in great numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite.\\nA shot fired among this swarm would have killed a great number, but to\\nfire a shot a gun was needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one;\\nbesides this, gulls and sea-mews are scarcely eatable, and even their\\neggs have a detestable taste. However, Herbert, who had gone forward\\na little more to the left, soon came upon rocks covered with sea-weed,\\nwhich, some hours later, would be hidden by the high tide. On these\\nrocks, in the midst of slippery wrack, abounded bivalve shell-fish, not\\nto be despised by starving people. Herbert called Pencroft, who ran up\\nhastily.\\n\\n“Here are mussels!” cried the sailor; “these will do instead of eggs!”\\n\\n“They are not mussels,” replied Herbert, who was attentively examining\\nthe molluscs attached to the rocks; “they are lithodomes.”\\n\\n“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Perfectly so.”\\n\\n“Then let us eat some lithodomes.”\\n\\nThe sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in natural\\nhistory, and always had had quite a passion for the science. His father\\nhad encouraged him in it, by letting him attend the lectures of the best\\nprofessors in Boston, who were very fond of the intelligent, industrious\\nlad. And his turn for natural history was, more than once in the course\\nof time, of great use, and he was not mistaken in this instance. These\\nlithodomes were oblong shells, suspended in clusters and adhering\\nvery tightly to the rocks. They belong to that species of molluscous\\nperforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is\\nrounded at both ends, a feature which is not remarked in the common\\nmussel.\\n\\nPencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which were\\nthen half opened to the sun. They ate them as oysters, and as they had\\na strong peppery taste, they were palatable without condiments of any\\nsort.\\n\\nTheir hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their thirst, which\\nincreased after eating these naturally-spiced molluscs. They had then to\\nfind fresh water, and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such\\na capriciously uneven region. Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken\\nthe precaution of collecting an ample supply of lithodomes, with which\\nthey filled their pockets and handkerchiefs, regained the foot of the\\ncliff.\\n\\nTwo hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through which, as\\nPencroft had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether fresh or not was to\\nbe ascertained. At this place the wall appeared to have been separated\\nby some violent subterranean force. At its base was hollowed out a\\nlittle creek, the farthest part of which formed a tolerably sharp angle.\\nThe watercourse at that part measured one hundred feet in breadth, and\\nits two banks on each side were scarcely twenty feet high. The river\\nbecame strong almost directly between the two walls of granite, which\\nbegan to sink above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared\\nbeneath a wood of stunted trees half a mile off.\\n\\n“Here is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!” said Pencroft.\\n“Well, Herbert, now we only want the house.”\\n\\nThe water of the river was limpid. The sailor ascertained that at this\\ntime--that is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods did not reach\\nit--it was sweet. This important point established, Herbert looked for\\nsome cavity which would serve them as a retreat, but in vain; everywhere\\nthe wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular.\\n\\nHowever, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high\\ntide, the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto, but a pile\\nof enormous rocks, such as are often met with in granite countries and\\nwhich bear the name of “Chimneys.”\\n\\nPencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by sandy\\npassages in which light was not wanting, for it entered through the\\nopenings which were left between the blocks, of which some were only\\nsustained by a miracle of equilibrium; but with the light came also\\nair--a regular corridor-gale--and with the wind the sharp cold from the\\nexterior. However, the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of\\nthe openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys could be\\nrendered habitable. Their geometrical plan represented the typographical\\nsign “&,” which signifies “et cetera” abridged, but by isolating the\\nupper mouth of the sign, through which the south and west winds blew so\\nstrongly, they could succeed in making the lower part of use.\\n\\n“Here’s our work,” said Pencroft, “and if we ever see Captain Harding\\nagain, he will know how to make something of this labyrinth.”\\n\\n“We shall see him again, Pencroft,” cried Herbert, “and when he returns\\nhe must find a tolerable dwelling here. It will be so, if we can make a\\nfireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke.”\\n\\n“So we can, my boy,” replied the sailor, “and these Chimneys will serve\\nour turn. Let us set to work, but first come and get a store of fuel. I\\nthink some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings,\\nthrough which the wind shrieks like so many fiends.”\\n\\nHerbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle, they\\nbegan to climb the left bank of the river. The current here was quite\\nrapid, and drifted down some dead wood. The rising tide--and it could\\nalready be perceived--must drive it back with force to a considerable\\ndistance. The sailor then thought that they could utilize this ebb and\\nflow for the transport of heavy objects.\\n\\nAfter having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the boy\\narrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left.\\nFrom this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent\\ntrees. These trees still retained their verdure, notwithstanding the\\nadvanced season, for they belonged to the family of “coniferae,” which\\nis spread over all the regions of the globe, from northern climates to\\nthe tropics. The young naturalist recognized especially the “deedara,”\\n which are very numerous in the Himalayan zone, and which spread around\\nthem a most agreeable odor. Between these beautiful trees sprang up\\nclusters of firs, whose opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around.\\nAmong the long grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry\\nbranches which crackled like fireworks.\\n\\n“Well, my boy,” said he to Herbert, “if I don’t know the name of these\\ntrees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them ‘burning wood,’ and\\njust now that’s the chief thing we want.”\\n\\n“Let us get a supply,” replied Herbert, who immediately set to work.\\n\\nThe collection was easily made. It was not even necessary to lop the\\ntrees, for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet;\\nbut if fuel was not wanting, the means of transporting it was not yet\\nfound. The wood, being very dry, would burn rapidly; it was therefore\\nnecessary to carry to the Chimneys a considerable quantity, and the\\nloads of two men would not be sufficient. Herbert remarked this.\\n\\n“Well, my boy,” replied the sailor, “there must be some way of carrying\\nthis wood; there is always a way of doing everything. If we had a cart\\nor a boat, it would be easy enough.”\\n\\n“But we have the river,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Right,” replied Pencroft; “the river will be to us like a road which\\ncarries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for nothing.”\\n\\n“Only,” observed Herbert, “at this moment our road is going the wrong\\nway, for the tide is rising!”\\n\\n“We shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs,” replied the sailor,\\n“and then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the Chimneys. Let us get\\nthe raft ready.”\\n\\nThe sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the river.\\nThey both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a load of wood\\nbound in fagots. They found on the bank also a great quantity of dead\\nbranches in the midst of grass, among which the foot of man had probably\\nnever before trod. Pencroft began directly to make his raft. In a kind\\nof little bay, created by a point of the shore which broke the current,\\nthe sailor and the lad placed some good-sized pieces of wood, which\\nthey had fastened together with dry creepers. A raft was thus formed, on\\nwhich they stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have\\nloaded at least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the\\nraft moored to the bank, awaited the turning of the tide.\\n\\nThere were still several hours to be occupied, and with one consent\\nPencroft and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so as to have a\\nmore extended view of the surrounding country.\\n\\nExactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river, the wall,\\nterminated by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle slope to the edge\\nof the forest. It was a natural staircase. Herbert and the sailor began\\ntheir ascent; thanks to the vigor of their muscles they reached the\\nsummit in a few minutes; and proceeded to the point above the mouth of\\nthe river.\\n\\nOn attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which not long\\nbefore they had traversed in such a terrible condition. They observed,\\nwith emotion, all that part to the north of the coast on which the\\ncatastrophe had taken place. It was there that Cyrus Harding had\\ndisappeared. They looked to see if some portion of their balloon, to\\nwhich a man might possibly cling, yet existed. Nothing! The sea was but\\none vast watery desert. As to the coast, it was solitary also. Neither\\nthe reporter nor Neb could be anywhere seen. But it was possible that at\\nthis time they were both too far away to be perceived.\\n\\n“Something tells me,” cried Herbert, “that a man as energetic as Captain\\nHarding would not let himself be drowned like other people. He must have\\nreached some point of the shore; don’t you think so, Pencroft?”\\n\\nThe sailor shook his head sadly. He little expected ever to see Cyrus\\nHarding again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert: “Doubtless,\\ndoubtless,” said he; “our engineer is a man who would get out of a\\nscrape to which any one else would yield.”\\n\\nIn the meantime he examined the coast with great attention. Stretched\\nout below them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right of the river’s\\nmouth by lines of breakers. The rocks which were visible appeared like\\namphibious monsters reposing in the surf. Beyond the reef, the sea\\nsparkled beneath the sun’s rays. To the south a sharp point closed the\\nhorizon, and it could not be seen if the land was prolonged in that\\ndirection, or if it ran southeast and southwest, which would have made\\nthis coast a very long peninsula. At the northern extremity of the bay\\nthe outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider\\ncurve. There the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great\\nbanks of sand, which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then\\nreturned towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the\\nsnow-topped mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven miles.\\nFrom its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread\\nvast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the\\npresence of evergreen trees. Then, from the edge of this forest to the\\nshore extended a plain, scattered irregularly with groups of trees. Here\\nand there on the left sparkled through glades the waters of the little\\nriver; they could trace its winding course back towards the spurs of the\\nmountain, among which it seemed to spring. At the point where the sailor\\nhad left his raft of wood, it began to run between the two high granite\\nwalls; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt, on\\nthe right bank, on the contrary, it sank gradually, the massive sides\\nchanged to isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the stones to shingle\\nrunning to the extremity of the point.\\n\\n“Are we on an island?” murmured the sailor.\\n\\n“At any rate, it seems to be big enough,” replied the lad.\\n\\n“An island, ever so big, is an island all the same!” said Pencroft.\\n\\nBut this important question could not yet be answered. A more perfect\\nsurvey had to be made to settle the point. As to the land itself, island\\nor continent, it appeared fertile, agreeable in its aspect, and varied\\nin its productions.\\n\\n“This is satisfactory,” observed Pencroft; “and in our misfortune, we\\nmust thank Providence for it.”\\n\\n“God be praised!” responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of\\ngratitude to the Author of all things.\\n\\nPencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which\\nthey had been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an\\ninspection what the future had in store for them.\\n\\nThey then returned, following the southern crest of the granite\\nplatform, bordered by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most\\nwhimsical shapes. Some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the\\nholes of the stone; Herbert, jumping over the rocks, startled a whole\\nflock of these winged creatures.\\n\\n“Oh!” cried he, “those are not gulls nor sea-mews!”\\n\\n“What are they then?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Upon my word, one would say they were pigeons!”\\n\\n“Just so, but these are wild or rock pigeons. I recognize them by\\nthe double band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by their\\nslate-colored plumage. But if the rock-pigeon is good to eat, its eggs\\nmust be excellent, and we will soon see how many they may have left in\\ntheir nests!”\\n\\n“We will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape of an\\nomelet!” replied Pencroft merrily.\\n\\n“But what will you make your omelet in?” asked Herbert; “in your hat?”\\n\\n“Well!” replied the sailor, “I am not quite conjuror enough for that;\\nwe must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will undertake to\\ndespatch the hardest!”\\n\\nPencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the granite,\\nand they really found eggs in some of the hollows. A few dozen being\\ncollected, were packed in the sailor’s handkerchief, and as the time\\nwhen the tide would be full was approaching, Pencroft and Herbert began\\nto redescend towards the watercourse. When they arrived there, it was\\nan hour after midday. The tide had already turned. They must now avail\\nthemselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth. Pencroft did not\\nintend to let the raft go away in the current without guidance, neither\\ndid he mean to embark on it himself to steer it. But a sailor is never\\nat a loss when there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft\\nrapidly twisted a cord, a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers. This\\nvegetable cable was fastened to the after-part of the raft, and the\\nsailor held it in his hand while Herbert, pushing off the raft with\\na long pole, kept it in the current. This succeeded capitally. The\\nenormous load of wood drifted down the current. The bank was very\\nequal; there was no fear that the raft would run aground, and before\\ntwo o’clock they arrived at the river’s mouth, a few paces from the\\nChimneys.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\nPencroft’s first care, after unloading the raft, was to render the cave\\nhabitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty. Sand,\\nstones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the galleries open to the\\nsouth winds. One narrow and winding opening at the side was kept, to\\nlead out the smoke and to make the fire draw. The cave was thus divided\\ninto three or four rooms, if such dark dens with which a donkey would\\nscarcely have been contented deserved the name. But they were dry, and\\nthere was space to stand upright, at least in the principal room, which\\noccupied the center. The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking\\nall in all they were well pleased with it for want of a better.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working, “our\\ncompanions have found a superior place to ours.”\\n\\n“Very likely,” replied the seaman; “but, as we don’t know, we must work\\nall the same. Better to have two strings to one’s bow than no string at\\nall!”\\n\\n“Oh!” exclaimed Herbert, “how jolly it will be if they were to find\\nCaptain Harding and were to bring him back with them!”\\n\\n“Yes, indeed!” said Pencroft, “that was a man of the right sort.”\\n\\n“Was!” exclaimed Herbert, “do you despair of ever seeing him again?”\\n\\n“God forbid!” replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and Pencroft\\ndeclared himself very well satisfied.\\n\\n“Now,” said he, “our friends can come back when they like. They will\\nfind a good enough shelter.”\\n\\nThey now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper--an easy\\ntask. Large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of the\\nnarrow passage which had been kept. This, if the smoke did not take\\nthe heat out with it, would be enough to maintain an equal temperature\\ninside. Their wood was stowed away in one of the rooms, and the sailor\\nlaid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood. The seaman was busy with\\nthis, when Herbert asked him if he had any matches.\\n\\n“Certainly,” replied Pencroft, “and I may say happily, for without\\nmatches or tinder we should be in a fix.”\\n\\n“Still we might get fire as the savages do,” replied Herbert, “by\\nrubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other.”\\n\\n“All right; try, my boy, and let’s see if you can do anything besides\\nexercising your arms.”\\n\\n“Well, it’s a very simple proceeding, and much used in the islands of\\nthe Pacific.”\\n\\n“I don’t deny it,” replied Pencroft, “but the savages must know how to\\ndo it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have tried to\\nget fire in that way, but I could never manage it. I must say I prefer\\nmatches. By the bye, where are my matches?”\\n\\nPencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always there,\\nfor he was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he rummaged the\\npockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could nowhere discover\\nthe box.\\n\\n“Here’s a go!” said he, looking at Herbert. “The box must have\\nfallen out of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must have\\nsomething--a tinder-box--anything that can possibly make fire!”\\n\\n“No, I haven’t, Pencroft.”\\n\\nThe sailor rushed out, followed by the boy. On the sand, among the\\nrocks, near the river’s bank, they both searched carefully, but in vain.\\nThe box was of copper, and therefore would have been easily seen.\\n\\n“Pencroft,” asked Herbert, “didn’t you throw it out of the car?”\\n\\n“I knew better than that,” replied the sailor; “but such a small article\\ncould easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone through. I\\nwould rather even have lost my pipe! Confound the box! Where can it be?”\\n\\n“Look here, the tide is going down,” said Herbert; “let’s run to the\\nplace where we landed.”\\n\\nIt was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the waves\\nhad rolled about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was as well\\nto try. Herbert and Pencroft walked rapidly to the point where they had\\nlanded the day before, about two hundred feet from the cave. They hunted\\nthere, among the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks, but found nothing.\\nIf the box had fallen at this place it must have been swept away by the\\nwaves. As the sea went down, they searched every little crevice with\\nno result. It was a grave loss in their circumstances, and for the\\ntime irreparable. Pencroft could not hide his vexation; he looked very\\nanxious, but said not a word. Herbert tried to console him by observing,\\nthat if they had found the matches, they would, very likely, have been\\nwetted by the sea and useless.\\n\\n“No, my boy,” replied the sailor; “they were in a copper box which shut\\nvery tightly; and now what are we to do?”\\n\\n“We shall certainly find some way of making a fire,” said Herbert.\\n“Captain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without them.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft; “but in the meantime we are without fire, and\\nour companions will find but a sorry repast on their return.”\\n\\n“But,” said Herbert quickly, “do you think it possible that they have no\\ntinder or matches?”\\n\\n“I doubt it,” replied the sailor, shaking his head, “for neither Neb nor\\nCaptain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would rather keep\\nhis note-book than his match-box.”\\n\\nHerbert did not reply. The loss of the box was certainly to be\\nregretted, but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way or\\nother. Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he was not\\na man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance. At any rate,\\nthere was only one thing to be done--to await the return of Neb and the\\nreporter; but they must give up the feast of hard eggs which they had\\nmeant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh was not an agreeable prospect\\neither for themselves or for the others.\\n\\nBefore returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the event of\\nfire being positively unattainable, collected some more shell-fish, and\\nthen silently retraced their steps to their dwelling.\\n\\nPencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his box. He\\neven climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth to the angle\\nwhere the raft had been moored. He returned to the plateau, went over it\\nin every direction, searched among the high grass on the border of the\\nforest, all in vain.\\n\\nIt was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the cave.\\nIt is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages were\\nransacked before they were obliged to give it up in despair. Towards\\nsix o’clock, when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the\\nwest, Herbert, who was walking up and down on the strand, signalized the\\nreturn of Neb and Spilett.\\n\\nThey were returning alone!... The boy’s heart sank; the sailor had not\\nbeen deceived in his forebodings; the engineer, Cyrus Harding, had not\\nbeen found!\\n\\nThe reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying\\nanything. Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not strength\\nto utter a word.\\n\\nAs to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears which he\\ncould not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope.\\n\\nThe reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to\\nrecover Cyrus Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a distance\\nof eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon\\nhad fallen the last time but one, a fall which was followed by the\\ndisappearance of the engineer and the dog Top. The shore was solitary;\\nnot a vestige of a mark. Not even a pebble recently displaced; not a\\ntrace on the sand; not a human footstep on all that part of the beach.\\nIt was clear that that portion of the shore had never been visited by\\na human being. The sea was as deserted as the land, and it was there,\\na few hundred feet from the coast, that the engineer must have found a\\ntomb.\\n\\nAs Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a voice which\\nshowed how hope struggled within him, “No! he is not dead! he can’t be\\ndead! It might happen to any one else, but never to him! He could get\\nout of anything!” Then his strength forsaking him, “Oh! I can do no\\nmore!” he murmured.\\n\\n“Neb,” said Herbert, running to him, “we will find him! God will give\\nhim back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you must eat\\nsomething.”\\n\\nSo saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of shell-fish, which\\nwas indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb had not eaten anything\\nfor several hours, but he refused them. He could not, would not live\\nwithout his master.\\n\\nAs to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid himself\\ndown on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak, but calm.\\nHerbert went up to him, and taking his hand, “Sir,” said he, “we\\nhave found a shelter which will be better than lying here. Night is\\nadvancing. Come and rest! To-morrow we will search farther.”\\n\\nThe reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the cave. On\\nthe way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if by chance he\\nhappened to have a match or two.\\n\\nThe reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing said, “I\\nhad some, but I must have thrown them away.”\\n\\nThe seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the same\\nanswer.\\n\\n“Confound it!” exclaimed the sailor.\\n\\nThe reporter heard him and seizing his arm, “Have you no matches?” he\\nasked.\\n\\n“Not one, and no fire in consequence.”\\n\\n“Ah!” cried Neb, “if my master was here, he would know what to do!”\\n\\nThe four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each other.\\nHerbert was the first to break the silence by saying, “Mr. Spilett,\\nyou are a smoker and always have matches about you; perhaps you haven’t\\nlooked well, try again, a single match will be enough!”\\n\\nThe reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers, waistcoat, and\\ngreat-coat, and at last to Pencroft’s great joy, no less to his extreme\\nsurprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood entangled in the lining of his\\nwaistcoat. He seized it with his fingers through the stuff, but he could\\nnot get it out. If this was a match and a single one, it was of great\\nimportance not to rub off the phosphorus.\\n\\n“Will you let me try?” said the boy, and very cleverly, without breaking\\nit, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious little bit of wood\\nwhich was of such great importance to these poor men. It was unused.\\n\\n“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft; “it is as good as having a whole cargo!” He\\ntook the match, and, followed by his companions, entered the cave.\\n\\nThis small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited country are\\nwasted with indifference and are of no value, must here be used with the\\ngreatest caution.\\n\\nThe sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, “We must\\nhave some paper,” said he.\\n\\n“Here,” replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his\\nnote-book.\\n\\nPencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him, and\\nknelt down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry\\nmoss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the\\nair could easily circulate, and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire.\\n\\nPencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a cone, as\\nsmokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss. Taking a\\nsmall, rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a beating heart,\\nholding his breath, he gently rubbed the match. The first attempt did\\nnot produce any effect. Pencroft had not struck hard enough, fearing to\\nrub off the phosphorus.\\n\\n“No, I can’t do it,” said he, “my hand trembles, the match has missed\\nfire; I cannot, I will not!” and rising, he told Herbert to take his\\nplace.\\n\\nCertainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous. Prometheus\\ngoing to steal the fire from heaven could not have been more anxious. He\\ndid not hesitate, however, but struck the match directly.\\n\\nA little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up, making\\na choking smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to augment the\\nflame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which in a few seconds\\ntoo caught fire, and then the moss.\\n\\nA minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame, assisted\\nby the vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the midst of the\\ndarkness.\\n\\n“At last!” cried Pencroft, getting up; “I was never so nervous before in\\nall my life!”\\n\\nThe flat stones made a capital fireplace. The smoke went quite easily\\nout at the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an agreeable warmth was\\nnot long in being felt.\\n\\nThey must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and always to\\nkeep some embers alight. It only needed care and attention, as they had\\nplenty of wood and could renew their store at any time.\\n\\nPencroft’s first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more\\nnourishing supper than a dish of shell-fish. Two dozen eggs were\\nbrought by Herbert. The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched these\\npreparations without saying anything. A threefold thought weighed on his\\nmind. Was Cyrus still alive? If he was alive, where was he? If he had\\nsurvived from his fall, how was it that he had not found some means of\\nmaking known his existence? As to Neb, he was roaming about the shore.\\nHe was like a body without a soul.\\n\\nPencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had no\\nchoice, and was obliged to content himself with roasting them under\\nthe hot cinders. In a few minutes the cooking was done, and the seaman\\ninvited the reporter to take his share of the supper. Such was the\\nfirst repast of the castaways on this unknown coast. The hard eggs\\nwere excellent, and as eggs contain everything indispensable to man’s\\nnourishment, these poor people thought themselves well off, and were\\nmuch strengthened by them. Oh! if only one of them had not been missing\\nat this meal! If the five prisoners who escaped from Richmond had been\\nall there, under the piled-up rocks, before this clear, crackling fire\\non the dry sand, what thanksgiving must they have rendered to Heaven!\\nBut the most ingenious, the most learned, he who was their unquestioned\\nchief, Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing, and his body had not even\\nobtained a burial-place.\\n\\nThus passed the 25th of March. Night had come on. Outside could be heard\\nthe howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking\\non the shore. The waves rolled the shingle backwards and forwards with a\\ndeafening noise.\\n\\nThe reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly noted down\\nthe occurrences of the day; the first appearance of this new land, the\\nloss of their leader, the exploration of the coast, the incident of the\\nmatches, etc.; and then overcome by fatigue, he managed to forget his\\nsorrows in sleep. Herbert went to sleep directly. As to the sailor, he\\npassed the night with one eye on the fire, on which he did not\\nspare fuel. But one of the castaways did not sleep in the cave. The\\ninconsolable, despairing Neb, notwithstanding all that his companions\\ncould say to induce him to take some rest, wandered all night long on\\nthe shore calling on his master.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\nThe inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the\\nclouds, thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited, was soon\\nmade out. They had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at\\nthe time of the catastrophe. We must mention, however, a note-book and\\na watch which Gideon Spilett had kept, doubtless by inadvertence, not a\\nweapon, not a tool, not even a pocket-knife; for while in the car they\\nhad thrown out everything to lighten the balloon. The imaginary heroes\\nof Daniel Defoe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal shipwrecked\\non Juan Fernandez and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never in\\nsuch absolute destitution. Either they had abundant resources from their\\nstranded vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some\\nthings were thrown up on the coast which supplied them with all the\\nfirst necessities of life. But here, not any instrument whatever, not a\\nutensil. From nothing they must supply themselves with everything.\\n\\nAnd yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer could\\nhave brought his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their\\nsituation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost. Alas! they must\\nhope no longer again to see Cyrus Harding. The castaways could expect\\nnothing but from themselves and from that Providence which never\\nabandons those whose faith is sincere.\\n\\nBut ought they to establish themselves on this part of the coast,\\nwithout trying to know to what continent it belonged, if it was\\ninhabited, or if they were on the shore of a desert island?\\n\\nIt was an important question, and should be solved with the shortest\\npossible delay. From its answer they would know what measures to take.\\nHowever, according to Pencroft’s advice, it appeared best to wait a few\\ndays before commencing an exploration. They must, in fact, prepare some\\nprovisions and procure more strengthening food than eggs and molluscs.\\nThe explorers, before undertaking new fatigues, must first of all\\nrecruit their strength.\\n\\nThe Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present. The fire was\\nlighted, and it was easy to preserve some embers. There were plenty of\\nshell-fish and eggs among the rocks and on the beach. It would be easy\\nto kill a few of the pigeons which were flying by hundreds about the\\nsummit of the plateau, either with sticks or stones. Perhaps the trees\\nof the neighboring forest would supply them with eatable fruit. Lastly,\\nthe sweet water was there.\\n\\nIt was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain at the\\nChimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along\\nthe shore or into the interior of the country. This plan suited Neb\\nparticularly. As obstinate in his ideas as in his presentiments, he\\nwas in no haste to abandon this part of the coast, the scene of the\\ncatastrophe. He did not, he would not believe in the loss of Cyrus\\nHarding. No, it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended\\nin this vulgar fashion, carried away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a\\nfew hundred feet from a shore. As long as the waves had not cast up the\\nbody of the engineer, as long as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes,\\ntouched with his hands the corpse of his master, he would not believe\\nin his death! And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his\\ndetermined heart. An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be\\nrespected, and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy. As for him,\\nhe hoped no longer, but there was no use in arguing with Neb. He was\\nlike the dog who will not leave the place where his master is buried,\\nand his grief was such that most probably he would not survive him.\\n\\nThis same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set out on\\nthe shore in a northerly direction, and he had returned to the spot\\nwhere the sea, no doubt, had closed over the unfortunate Harding.\\n\\nThat day’s breakfast was composed solely of pigeon’s eggs and\\nlithodomes. Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in the\\nhollows of the rocks, and this mineral was very welcome.\\n\\nThe repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to accompany\\nHerbert and himself to the forest, where they were going to try to\\nhunt. But on consideration, it was thought necessary that someone should\\nremain to keep in the fire, and to be at hand in the highly improbable\\nevent of Neb requiring aid. The reporter accordingly remained behind.\\n\\n“To the chase, Herbert,” said the sailor. “We shall find ammunition\\non our way, and cut our weapons in the forest.” But at the moment of\\nstarting, Herbert observed, that since they had no tinder, it would\\nperhaps be prudent to replace it by another substance.\\n\\n“What?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Burnt linen,” replied the boy. “That could in case of need serve for\\ntinder.”\\n\\nThe sailor thought it very sensible advice. Only it had the\\ninconvenience of necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief.\\nNotwithstanding, the thing was well worth while trying, and a part of\\nPencroft’s large checked handkerchief was soon reduced to the state of\\na half-burnt rag. This inflammable material was placed in the central\\nchamber at the bottom of a little cavity in the rock, sheltered from all\\nwind and damp.\\n\\nIt was nine o’clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and the\\nbreeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of\\nthe Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at\\nthat place, curled round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of\\nthe river.\\n\\nArrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout\\nbranches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert\\nrubbed smooth on a rock. Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!\\n\\nThe two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the bank.\\nFrom the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river\\nnarrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks, over\\nwhich the trees formed a double arch. Pencroft, lest they should lose\\nthemselves, resolved to follow the course of the stream, which would\\nalways lead them back to the point from which they started. But the bank\\nwas not without some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the trees\\nbent level with the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had\\nto break down with their sticks. Herbert often glided among the\\nbroken stumps with the agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the\\nunderwood. But Pencroft called him back directly, begging him not to\\nwander away. Meanwhile, the sailor attentively observed the disposition\\nand nature of the surrounding country. On the left bank, the ground,\\nwhich was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior. It\\nlooked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless reached\\nthe river by some underground drain. Sometimes a stream ran through the\\nunderwood, which they crossed without difficulty. The opposite shore\\nappeared to be more uneven, and the valley of which the river occupied\\nthe bottom was more clearly visible. The hill, covered with trees\\ndisposed in terraces, intercepted the view. On the right bank walking\\nwould have been difficult, for the declivities fell suddenly, and the\\ntrees bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of\\ntheir roots.\\n\\nIt is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already\\nsurveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft only saw\\ntraces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not\\nrecognize the species. In all probability, and such was also Herbert’s\\nopinion, some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless\\nwould give them some trouble; but nowhere did they observe the mark of\\nan axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a\\nhuman foot. On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on\\nany land in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps\\nmore to be feared than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little,\\nfor the difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and\\nafter walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile.\\nAs yet the hunt had not been successful. However, some birds sang\\nand fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had\\ninspired them with an instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert described,\\nin a marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely\\nresembling the king-fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a\\nmetallic brilliancy.\\n\\n“That must be a jacamar,” said Herbert, trying to get nearer.\\n\\n“This will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar,” replied the sailor,\\n“if that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!”\\n\\nJust then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the creature on\\nthe wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the jacamar ran off and\\ndisappeared in an instant.\\n\\n“How clumsy I am!” cried Herbert.\\n\\n“No, no, my boy!” replied the sailor. “The blow was well aimed; many a\\none would have missed it altogether! Come, don’t be vexed with yourself.\\nWe shall catch it another day!”\\n\\nAs the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more scattered, many\\nbeing magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit. Pencroft searched in\\nvain for some of those precious palm-trees which are employed in so many\\nways in domestic life, and which have been found as far as the fortieth\\nparallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in\\nthe Southern Hemisphere. But this forest was only composed of coniferae,\\nsuch as deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine,\\nsimilar to those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and\\nsplendid firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.\\n\\nAt this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty plumage,\\nwith long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the branches\\nstrewing their feathers, which covered the ground as with fine down.\\nHerbert picked up a few of these feathers, and after having examined\\nthem,--\\n\\n“These are couroucous,” said he.\\n\\n“I should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl,” replied Pencroft, “still,\\nif they are good to eat--”\\n\\n“They are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,” replied\\nHerbert. “Besides, if I don’t mistake, it is easy to approach and kill\\nthem with a stick.”\\n\\nThe sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the foot\\nof a tree, whose lower branches were covered with little birds. The\\ncouroucous were waiting the passage of insects which served for their\\nnourishment. Their feathery feet could be seen clasping the slender\\ntwigs which supported them.\\n\\nThe hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they mowed\\ndown whole rows of these couroucous, who never thought of flying away,\\nand stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off. A hundred were\\nalready heaped on the ground, before the others made up their minds to\\nfly.\\n\\n“Well,” said Pencroft, “here is game, which is quite within the reach of\\nhunters like us. We have only to put out our hands and take it!”\\n\\nThe sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs,\\nthey then continued their exploration. The stream here made a bend\\ntowards the south, but this detour was probably not prolonged for the\\nriver must have its source in the mountain, and be supplied by the\\nmelting of the snow which covered the sides of the central cone.\\n\\nThe particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to\\nprocure the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of\\nthe Chimneys. It must be acknowledged that as yet this object had not\\nbeen attained. So the sailor actively pursued his researches, though he\\nexclaimed, when some animal which he had not even time to recognize\\nfled into the long grass, “If only we had had the dog Top!” But Top had\\ndisappeared at the same time as his master, and had probably perished\\nwith him.\\n\\nTowards three o’clock new flocks of birds were seen through certain\\ntrees, at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those of the\\njuniper-tree among others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded\\nthrough the forest. This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game\\nbird called grouse in the United States. They soon saw several couples,\\nwhose plumage was rich chestnut-brown mottled with dark brown, and tail\\nof the same color. Herbert recognized the males by the two wing-like\\nappendages raised on the neck. Pencroft determined to get hold of at\\nleast one of these gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose\\nflesh is better than that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they\\nwould not allow themselves to be approached. After several fruitless\\nattempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor\\nsaid to the lad,--\\n\\n“Decidedly, since we can’t kill them on the wing, we must try to take\\nthem with a line.”\\n\\n“Like a fish?” cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal.\\n\\n“Like a fish,” replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had found\\namong the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four\\neggs. He took great care not to touch these nests, to which their\\nproprietors would not fail to return. It was around these that he\\nmeant to stretch his lines, not snares, but real fishing-lines. He took\\nHerbert to some distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular\\napparatus with all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would\\nhave used. Herbert watched the work with great interest, though rather\\ndoubting its success. The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened\\none to the other, of the length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong\\nthorns, the points bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia\\nbush) were fastened to the ends of the creepers, by way of hooks. Large\\nred worms, which were crawling on the ground, furnished bait.\\n\\nThis done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself\\nskillfully, placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse\\nnests; then he returned, took the other ends and hid with Herbert behind\\na large tree. There they both waited patiently; though, it must be\\nsaid, that Herbert did not reckon much on the success of the inventive\\nPencroft.\\n\\nA whole half-hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised, several\\ncouple of grouse returned to their nests. They walked along, pecking the\\nground, and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters,\\nwho, besides, had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the\\ngallinaceae.\\n\\nThe lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his breath, and\\nPencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips advanced, as if\\nabout to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely breathed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any notice\\nof them. Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait as if the\\nworms had been still alive.\\n\\nThe sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the\\nfisherman, for he does not see his prey coming through the water. The\\njerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the\\nhooks with their beaks. Three voracious grouse swallowed at the same\\nmoment bait and hook. Suddenly with a smart jerk, Pencroft “struck” his\\nline, and a flapping of wings showed that the birds were taken.\\n\\n“Hurrah!” he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made himself\\nmaster in an instant.\\n\\nHerbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had ever seen\\nbirds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly confessed that it was\\nnot his first attempt, and that besides he could not claim the merit of\\ninvention.\\n\\n“And at any rate,” added he, “situated as we are, we must hope to hit\\nupon many other contrivances.”\\n\\nThe grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted at not\\nhaving to appear before their companions with empty hands, and observing\\nthat the day had begun to decline, judged it best to return to their\\ndwelling.\\n\\nThe direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had only\\nto follow, and, towards six o’clock, tired enough with their excursion,\\nHerbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\nGideon Spilett was standing motionless on the shore, his arms crossed,\\ngazing over the sea, the horizon of which was lost towards the east in\\na thick black cloud which was spreading rapidly towards the zenith.\\nThe wind was already strong, and increased with the decline of day.\\nThe whole sky was of a threatening aspect, and the first symptoms of a\\nviolent storm were clearly visible.\\n\\nHerbert entered the Chimneys, and Pencroft went towards the reporter.\\nThe latter, deeply absorbed, did not see him approach.\\n\\n“We are going to have a dirty night, Mr. Spilett!” said the sailor:\\n“Petrels delight in wind and rain.”\\n\\nThe reporter, turning at the moment, saw Pencroft, and his first words\\nwere,--\\n\\n“At what distance from the coast would you say the car was, when the\\nwaves carried off our companion?”\\n\\nThe sailor had not expected this question. He reflected an instant and\\nreplied,--\\n\\n“Two cables lengths at the most.”\\n\\n“But what is a cable’s length?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“About a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet.”\\n\\n“Then,” said the reporter, “Cyrus Harding must have disappeared twelve\\nhundred feet at the most from the shore?”\\n\\n“About that,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“And his dog also?”\\n\\n“Also.”\\n\\n“What astonishes me,” rejoined the reporter, “while admitting that our\\ncompanion has perished, is that Top has also met his death, and that\\nneither the body of the dog nor of his master has been cast on the\\nshore!”\\n\\n“It is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea,” replied the sailor.\\n“Besides, it is possible that currents have carried them farther down\\nthe coast.”\\n\\n“Then, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?”\\n again asked the reporter.\\n\\n“That is my opinion.”\\n\\n“My own opinion,” said Gideon Spilett, “with due deference to your\\nexperience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the absolute\\ndisappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is something\\nunaccountable and unlikely.”\\n\\n“I wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett,” replied Pencroft;\\n“unhappily, my mind is made up on this point.” Having said this, the\\nsailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the hearth.\\nHerbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the flame cast a\\nbright light into the darkest parts of the passage.\\n\\nPencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared best to\\nintroduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all needed to get\\nup their strength. The strings of couroucous were kept for the next day,\\nbut they plucked a couple of grouse, which were soon spitted on a stick,\\nand roasting before a blazing fire.\\n\\nAt seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged absence of\\nthe Negro made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared that he had met\\nwith an accident on this unknown land, or that the unhappy fellow had\\nbeen driven to some act of despair. But Herbert drew very different\\nconclusions from this absence. According to him, Neb’s delay was caused\\nby some new circumstances which had induced him to prolong his search.\\nAlso, everything new must be to the advantage of Cyrus Harding. Why had\\nNeb not returned unless hope still detained him? Perhaps he had found\\nsome mark, a footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path.\\nPerhaps he was at this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was\\nnear his master.\\n\\nThus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him talk. The\\nreporter alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft thought most\\nprobable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther\\nthan the day before, and that he had not as yet had time to return.\\n\\nHerbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times\\nmanifested an intention to go to meet Neb. But Pencroft assured him\\nthat that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and deplorable\\nweather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it would be much\\nbetter to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance by the next day,\\nPencroft would not hesitate to join him in his search.\\n\\nGideon Spilett approved of the sailor’s opinion that it was best not to\\ndivide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but two large\\ntears fell from his eyes.\\n\\nThe reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy.\\n\\nBad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed over\\nthe coast. The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain was\\ndashed by the storm into particles like dust. Ragged masses of vapor\\ndrove along the beach, on which the tormented shingles sounded as if\\npoured out in cart-loads, while the sand raised by the wind added as\\nit were mineral dust to that which was liquid, and rendered the united\\nattack insupportable. Between the river’s mouth and the end of the\\ncliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the\\nwater which ran through the narrow valley. The smoke from the fireplace\\nwas also driven back through the opening, filling the passages and\\nrendering them uninhabitable.\\n\\nTherefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die away,\\nand only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt that the\\nfrightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he must have\\ntaken refuge in some cave, to await the end of the storm or at least the\\nreturn of day. As to going to meet him, or attempting to find him, it\\nwas impossible.\\n\\nThe game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was excellent,\\nand Pencroft and Herbert, whose long excursion had rendered them very\\nhungry, devoured it with infinite satisfaction.\\n\\nTheir meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had rested\\nthe preceding night, and Herbert was not long in going to sleep near the\\nsailor, who had stretched himself beside the fireplace.\\n\\nOutside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in strength,\\nuntil it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from Richmond\\nto this land in the Pacific. The tempests which are frequent during the\\nseasons of the equinox, and which are so prolific in catastrophes, are\\nabove all terrible over this immense ocean, which opposes no obstacle to\\ntheir fury. No description can give an idea of the terrific violence of\\nthe gale as it beat upon the unprotected coast.\\n\\nHappily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid. It was\\ncomposed of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which, insecurely\\nbalanced, seemed to tremble on their foundations, and Pencroft could\\nfeel rapid quiverings under his head as it rested on the rock. But he\\nrepeated to himself, and rightly, that there was nothing to fear, and\\nthat their retreat would not give way. However he heard the noise of\\nstones torn from the summit of the plateau by the wind, falling down on\\nto the beach. A few even rolled on to the upper part of the Chimneys,\\nor flew off in fragments when they were projected perpendicularly. Twice\\nthe sailor rose and intrenched himself at the opening of the passage, so\\nas to take a look in safety at the outside. But there was nothing to be\\nfeared from these showers, which were not considerable, and he returned\\nto his couch before the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath the\\nashes.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest,\\nthe thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly. Sleep at last\\ntook possession of Pencroft, whom a seafaring life had habituated to\\nanything. Gideon Spilett alone was kept awake by anxiety. He reproached\\nhimself with not having accompanied Neb. It was evident that he had not\\nabandoned all hope. The presentiments which had troubled Herbert did not\\ncease to agitate him also. His thoughts were concentrated on Neb. Why\\nhad Neb not returned? He tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely\\ngiving a thought to the struggle of the elements. Now and then, his\\neyes, heavy with fatigue, closed for an instant, but some sudden thought\\nreopened them almost immediately.\\n\\nMeanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from morning,\\nwhen Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously shaken.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” he cried, rousing himself, and collecting his ideas\\nwith the promptitude usual to seamen.\\n\\nThe reporter was leaning over him, and saying,--\\n\\n“Listen, Pencroft, listen!”\\n\\nThe sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond those\\ncaused by the storm.\\n\\n“It is the wind,” said he.\\n\\n“No,” replied Gideon Spilett, listening again, “I thought I heard--”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“The barking of a dog!”\\n\\n“A dog!” cried Pencroft, springing up.\\n\\n“Yes--barking--”\\n\\n“It’s not possible!” replied the sailor. “And besides, how, in the\\nroaring of the storm--”\\n\\n“Stop--listen--” said the reporter.\\n\\nPencroft listened more attentively, and really thought he heard, during\\na lull, distant barking.\\n\\n“Well!” said the reporter, pressing the sailor’s hand.\\n\\n“Yes--yes!” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“It is Top! It is Top!” cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all three\\nrushed towards the opening of the Chimneys. They had great difficulty in\\ngetting out. The wind drove them back. But at last they succeeded, and\\ncould only remain standing by leaning against the rocks. They looked\\nabout, but could not speak. The darkness was intense. The sea, the sky,\\nthe land were all mingled in one black mass. Not a speck of light was\\nvisible.\\n\\nThe reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes,\\noverwhelmed by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand.\\n\\nThen, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking, which they\\nfound must be at some distance.\\n\\nIt could only be Top! But was he alone or accompanied? He was most\\nprobably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made\\nhis way more directly towards the Chimneys. The sailor squeezed the\\nreporter’s hand, for he could not make himself heard, in a way which\\nsignified “Wait!” then he reentered the passage.\\n\\nAn instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the\\ndarkness, whistling shrilly.\\n\\nIt appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking\\nimmediately came nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage.\\nPencroft, Herbert, and Spilett entered after him.\\n\\nAn armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers. The passage was lighted\\nup with a bright flame.\\n\\n“It is Top!” cried Herbert.\\n\\nIt was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, who derived from these\\ntwo races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which\\nare the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs. It was the dog of the\\nengineer, Cyrus Harding. But he was alone! Neither Neb nor his master\\naccompanied him!\\n\\nHow was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the Chimneys,\\nwhich he did not know? It appeared inexplicable, above all, in the\\nmidst of this black night and in such a tempest! But what was still more\\ninexplicable was, that Top was neither tired, nor exhausted, nor even\\nsoiled with mud or sand!--Herbert had drawn him towards him, and was\\npatting his head, the dog rubbing his neck against the lad’s hands.\\n\\n“If the dog is found, the master will be found also!” said the reporter.\\n\\n“God grant it!” responded Herbert. “Let us set off! Top will guide us!”\\n\\nPencroft did not make any objection. He felt that Top’s arrival\\ncontradicted his conjectures. “Come along then!” said he.\\n\\nPencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth. He placed a few\\npieces of wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until their return.\\nThen, preceded by the dog, who seemed to invite them by short barks to\\ncome with him, and followed by the reporter and the boy, he dashed out,\\nafter having put up in his handkerchief the remains of the supper.\\n\\nThe storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its height. Not a\\nsingle ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds. To follow\\na straight course was difficult. It was best to rely on Top’s instinct.\\nThey did so. The reporter and Herbert walked behind the dog, and the\\nsailor brought up the rear. It was impossible to exchange a word. The\\nrain was not very heavy, but the wind was terrific.\\n\\nHowever, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two companions. The\\nwind being southeast, consequently blew on their backs. The clouds of\\nsand, which otherwise would have been insupportable, from being received\\nbehind, did not in consequence impede their progress. In short, they\\nsometimes went faster than they liked, and had some difficulty in\\nkeeping their feet; but hope gave them strength, for it was not at\\nrandom that they made their way along the shore. They had no doubt that\\nNeb had found his master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog.\\nBut was the engineer living, or had Neb only sent for his companions\\nthat they might render the last duties to the corpse of the unfortunate\\nHarding?\\n\\nAfter having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and Pencroft\\nprudently stepped aside to stop and take breath. The turn of the rocks\\nsheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe after this walk or\\nrather run of a quarter of an hour.\\n\\nThey could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having\\npronounced the name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks, as\\nmuch as to say that his master was saved.\\n\\n“Saved, isn’t he?” repeated Herbert; “saved, Top?”\\n\\nAnd the dog barked in reply.\\n\\nThey once more set out. The tide began to rise, and urged by the wind it\\nthreatened to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide. Great billows\\nthundered against the reef with such violence that they probably passed\\nentirely over the islet, then quite invisible. The mole no longer\\nprotected the coast, which was directly exposed to the attacks of the\\nopen sea.\\n\\nAs soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the wind\\nstruck them again with renewed fury. Though bent under the gale they\\nwalked very quickly, following Top, who did not hesitate as to what\\ndirection to take.\\n\\nThey ascended towards the north, having on their left an interminable\\nextent of billows, which broke with a deafening noise, and on their\\nright a dark country, the aspect of which it was impossible to guess.\\nBut they felt that it was comparatively flat, for the wind passed\\ncompletely over them, without being driven back as it was when it came\\nin contact with the cliff.\\n\\nAt four o’clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had cleared\\nabout five miles. The clouds were slightly raised, and the wind, though\\nless damp, was very sharp and cold. Insufficiently protected by their\\nclothing, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett suffered cruelly, but not\\na complaint escaped their lips. They were determined to follow Top,\\nwherever the intelligent animal wished to lead them.\\n\\nTowards five o’clock day began to break. At the zenith, where the fog\\nwas less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an opaque belt, a\\nluminous line clearly traced the horizon. The crests of the billows were\\ntipped with a wild light, and the foam regained its whiteness. At the\\nsame time on the left the hilly parts of the coast could be seen, though\\nvery indistinctly.\\n\\nAt six o’clock day had broken. The clouds rapidly lifted. The seaman and\\nhis companions were then about six miles from the Chimneys. They were\\nfollowing a very flat shore bounded by a reef of rocks, whose heads\\nscarcely emerged from the sea, for they were in deep water. On the left,\\nthe country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs, bristling\\nwith thistles. There was no cliff, and the shore offered no resistance\\nto the ocean but a chain of irregular hillocks. Here and there grew two\\nor three trees, inclined towards the west, their branches projecting in\\nthat direction. Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border of\\nthe forest.\\n\\nAt this moment, Top became very excited. He ran forward, then returned,\\nand seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps. The dog then left the\\nbeach, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without showing the least\\nhesitation, went straight in among the downs. They followed him. The\\ncountry appeared an absolute desert. Not a living creature was to be\\nseen.\\n\\nThe downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of hillocks\\nand even of hills, very irregularly distributed. They resembled a\\nSwitzerland modeled in sand, and only an amazing instinct could have\\npossibly recognized the way.\\n\\nFive minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his two\\ncompanions arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the back of\\na high mound. There Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear bark. Spilett,\\nHerbert, and Pencroft dashed into the cave.\\n\\nNeb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of grass.\\n\\nThe body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\n\\nNeb did not move. Pencroft only uttered one word.\\n\\n“Living?” he cried.\\n\\nNeb did not reply. Spilett and the sailor turned pale. Herbert clasped\\nhis hands, and remained motionless. The poor Negro, absorbed in his\\ngrief, evidently had neither seen his companions nor heard the sailor\\nspeak.\\n\\nThe reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear\\nto the engineer’s chest, having first torn open his clothes.\\n\\nA minute--an age!--passed, during which he endeavored to catch the\\nfaintest throb of the heart.\\n\\nNeb had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing. Despair had\\ncompletely changed his countenance. He could scarcely be recognized,\\nexhausted with fatigue, broken with grief. He believed his master was\\ndead.\\n\\nGideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive examination.\\n\\n“He lives!” said he.\\n\\nPencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a\\nthrobbing, and even felt a slight breath on his cheek.\\n\\nHerbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water. He found,\\na hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have been greatly\\nincreased by the rains, and which filtered through the sand; but nothing\\nin which to put the water, not even a shell among the downs. The lad was\\nobliged to content himself with dipping his handkerchief in the stream,\\nand with it hastened back to the grotto.\\n\\nHappily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who only\\nwished to wet the engineer’s lips. The cold water produced an almost\\nimmediate effect. His chest heaved and he seemed to try to speak.\\n\\n“We will save him!” exclaimed the reporter.\\n\\nAt these words hope revived in Neb’s heart. He undressed his master\\nto see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to be found,\\neither on the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising, as he must\\nhave been dashed against the rocks; even the hands were uninjured, and\\nit was difficult to explain how the engineer showed no traces of the\\nefforts which he must have made to get out of reach of the breakers.\\n\\nBut the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to speak he\\nwould say what had happened. For the present the question was, how to\\nrecall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing would bring this\\nabout; so they set to work with the sailor’s jersey.\\n\\nThe engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm slightly\\nand began to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from exhaustion,\\nand certainly, had not the reporter and his companions arrived, it would\\nhave been all over with Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“You thought your master was dead, didn’t you?” said the seaman to Neb.\\n\\n“Yes! quite dead!” replied Neb, “and if Top had not found you, and\\nbrought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have lain\\ndown on his grave to die!”\\n\\nIt had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!\\n\\nNeb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after having\\nleft the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in a northerly\\ndirection, and had reached that part of the shore which he had already\\nvisited.\\n\\nThere, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the beach,\\namong the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to guide him. He\\nexamined particularly that part of the beach which was not covered by\\nthe high tide, for near the sea the water would have obliterated all\\nmarks. Neb did not expect to find his master living. It was for a corpse\\nthat he searched, a corpse which he wished to bury with his own hands!\\n\\nHe sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have been\\nvisited by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea had not\\nreached, and which might be met with by millions above high-water mark,\\nwere untouched. Not a shell was broken.\\n\\nNeb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was\\npossible that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant point.\\nWhen a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it rarely\\nhappens that the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later. This Neb\\nknew, and he wished to see his master again for the last time.\\n\\n“I went along the coast for another two miles, carefully examining\\nthe beach, both at high and low water, and I had despaired of finding\\nanything, when yesterday, above five in the evening, I saw footprints on\\nthe sand.”\\n\\n“Footprints?” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\n“Yes!” replied Neb.\\n\\n“Did these footprints begin at the water’s edge?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“No,” replied Neb, “only above high-water mark, for the others must have\\nbeen washed out by the tide.”\\n\\n“Go on, Neb,” said Spilett.\\n\\n“I went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very clear\\nand went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of a mile,\\nrunning, but taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes after, as\\nit was getting dark, I heard the barking of a dog. It was Top, and Top\\nbrought me here, to my master!”\\n\\nNeb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the\\ninanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life.\\nNow that he had found him dead he longed for him to be alive. All his\\nefforts were useless! Nothing remained to be done but to render the last\\nduties to the one whom he had loved so much! Neb then thought of his\\ncompanions. They, no doubt, would wish to see the unfortunate man again.\\nTop was there. Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal?\\nNeb several times pronounced the name of the reporter, the one among his\\ncompanions whom Top knew best.\\n\\nThen he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the direction\\nindicated to him.\\n\\nWe have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked upon\\nalmost as supernatural, Top had found them.\\n\\nNeb’s companions had listened with great attention to this account.\\n\\nIt was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the efforts which\\nhe must have made to escape from the waves by crossing the rocks, had\\nnot received even a scratch. And what could not be explained either was\\nhow the engineer had managed to get to this cave in the downs, more than\\na mile from the shore.\\n\\n“So, Neb,” said the reporter, “it was not you who brought your master to\\nthis place.”\\n\\n“No, it was not I,” replied the Negro.\\n\\n“It’s very clear that the captain came here by himself,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“It is clear in reality,” observed Spilett, “but it is not credible!”\\n\\nThe explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer’s\\nown lips, and they must wait for that till speech returned. Rubbing had\\nre-established the circulation of the blood. Cyrus Harding moved his arm\\nagain, then his head, and a few incomprehensible words escaped him.\\n\\nNeb, who was bending over him, spoke, but the engineer did not appear\\nto hear, and his eyes remained closed. Life was only exhibited in him by\\nmovement, his senses had not as yet been restored.\\n\\nPencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of\\nprocuring it, for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the burnt\\nlinen, which would easily have ignited from the sparks produced by\\nstriking together two flints. As to the engineer’s pockets, they were\\nentirely empty, except that of his waistcoat, which contained his watch.\\nIt was necessary to carry Harding to the Chimneys, and that as soon as\\npossible. This was the opinion of all.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back\\nto consciousness sooner than they could have expected. The water with\\nwhich they wetted his lips revived him gradually. Pencroft also thought\\nof mixing with the water some moisture from the titra’s flesh which\\nhe had brought. Herbert ran to the beach and returned with two large\\nbivalve shells. The sailor concocted something which he introduced\\nbetween the lips of the engineer, who eagerly drinking it opened his\\neyes.\\n\\nNeb and the reporter were leaning over him.\\n\\n“My master! my master!” cried Neb.\\n\\nThe engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his other\\ntwo companions, and his hand slightly pressed theirs.\\n\\nA few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were, even\\nthen, troubling his brain. This time he was understood. Undoubtedly they\\nwere the same words he had before attempted to utter.\\n\\n“Island or continent?” he murmured.\\n\\n“Bother the continent,” cried Pencroft hastily; “there is time enough\\nto see about that, captain! we don’t care for anything, provided you are\\nliving.”\\n\\nThe engineer nodded faintly, and then appeared to sleep.\\n\\nThey respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to make\\narrangements for transporting Harding to a more comfortable place. Neb,\\nHerbert, and Pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards\\na high mound crowned with a few distorted trees. On the way the sailor\\ncould not help repeating,--\\n\\n“Island or continent! To think of that, when at one’s last gasp! What a\\nman!”\\n\\nArrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two companions\\nset to work, with no other tools than their hands, to despoil of its\\nprincipal branches a rather sickly tree, a sort of marine fir; with\\nthese branches they made a litter, on which, covered with grass and\\nleaves, they could carry the engineer.\\n\\nThis occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o’clock when\\nthey returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left.\\n\\nThe engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the\\ndrowsiness, in which they had found him. The color was returning to his\\ncheeks, which till now had been as pale as death. He raised himself a\\nlittle, looked around him, and appeared to ask where he was.\\n\\n“Can you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“It’s my opinion,” said the sailor, “that Captain Harding will be\\nable to listen to you still better, if he will have some more grouse\\njelly,--for we have grouse, captain,” added he, presenting him with a\\nlittle of this jelly, to which he this time added some of the flesh.\\n\\nCyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was divided\\namong his companions, who found it but a meager breakfast, for they were\\nsuffering extremely from hunger.\\n\\n“Well!” said the sailor, “there is plenty of food at the Chimneys, for\\nyou must know, captain, that down there, in the south, we have a house,\\nwith rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the pantry, several dozen of\\nbirds, which our Herbert calls couroucous. Your litter is ready, and as\\nsoon as you feel strong enough we will carry you home.”\\n\\n“Thanks, my friend,” replied the engineer; “wait another hour or two,\\nand then we will set out. And now speak, Spilett.”\\n\\nThe reporter then told him all that had occurred. He recounted all the\\nevents with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of the balloon,\\nthe landing on this unknown land, which appeared a desert (whatever it\\nwas, whether island or continent), the discovery of the Chimneys,\\nthe search for him, not forgetting of course Neb’s devotion, the\\nintelligence exhibited by the faithful Top, as well as many other\\nmatters.\\n\\n“But,” asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, “you did not, then, pick\\nme up on the beach?”\\n\\n“No,” replied the reporter.\\n\\n“And did you not bring me to this cave?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“At what distance is this cave from the sea?”\\n\\n“About a mile,” replied Pencroft; “and if you are astonished, captain,\\nwe are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this place!”\\n\\n“Indeed,” said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and who took\\ngreat interest in these details, “indeed it is very singular!”\\n\\n“But,” resumed the sailor, “can you tell us what happened after you were\\ncarried off by the sea?”\\n\\nCyrus Harding considered. He knew very little. The wave had torn him\\nfrom the balloon net. He sank at first several fathoms. On returning\\nto the surface, in the half light, he felt a living creature struggling\\nnear him. It was Top, who had sprung to his help. He saw nothing of the\\nballoon, which, lightened both of his weight and that of the dog, had\\ndarted away like an arrow.\\n\\nThere he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which could\\nnot be less than half a mile from the shore. He attempted to struggle\\nagainst the billows by swimming vigorously. Top held him up by his\\nclothes; but a strong current seized him and drove him towards the\\nnorth, and after half an hour of exertion, he sank, dragging Top\\nwith him into the depths. From that moment to the moment in which he\\nrecovered to find himself in the arms of his friends he remembered\\nnothing.\\n\\n“However,” remarked Pencroft, “you must have been thrown on to the\\nbeach, and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb found your\\nfootmarks!”\\n\\n“Yes... of course,” replied the engineer, thoughtfully; “and you found\\nno traces of human beings on this coast?”\\n\\n“Not a trace,” replied the reporter; “besides, if by chance you had met\\nwith some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why should he have\\nabandoned you after having saved you from the waves?”\\n\\n“You are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb,” added the engineer,\\nturning to his servant, “it was not you who... you can’t have had a\\nmoment of unconsciousness... during which no, that’s absurd.... Do any\\nof the footsteps still remain?” asked Harding.\\n\\n“Yes, master,” replied Neb; “here, at the entrance, at the back of\\nthe mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind. The storm has\\ndestroyed the others.”\\n\\n“Pencroft,” said Cyrus Harding, “will you take my shoe and see if it\\nfits exactly to the footprints?”\\n\\nThe sailor did as the engineer requested. While he and Herbert, guided\\nby Neb, went to the place where the footprints were to be found, Cyrus\\nremarked to the reporter,--\\n\\n“It is a most extraordinary thing!”\\n\\n“Perfectly inexplicable!” replied Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“But do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will talk about\\nit by-and-by.”\\n\\nA moment after the others entered.\\n\\nThere was no doubt about it. The engineer’s shoe fitted exactly to the\\nfootmarks. It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them on the sand.\\n\\n“Come,” said he, “I must have experienced this unconsciousness which I\\nattributed to Neb. I must have walked like a somnambulist, without any\\nknowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me here, after having\\ndragged me from the waves... Come, Top! Come, old dog!”\\n\\nThe magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and caresses were\\nlavished on him. It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting\\nfor the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of\\nthe affair.\\n\\nTowards twelve o’clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if they could\\nnow remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an effort which\\nexhibited the most energetic will, got up. But he was obliged to lean on\\nthe sailor, or he would have fallen.\\n\\n“Well done!” cried Pencroft; “bring the captain’s litter.”\\n\\nThe litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with\\nleaves and long grass. Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft, having\\ntaken his place at one end and Neb at the other, they started towards\\nthe coast. There was a distance of eight miles to be accomplished; but,\\nas they could not go fast, and it would perhaps be necessary to stop\\nfrequently, they reckoned that it would take at least six hours to reach\\nthe Chimneys. The wind was still strong, but fortunately it did not\\nrain. Although lying down, the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed\\nthe coast, particularly inland. He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no\\ndoubt, the appearance of the country, with its inequalities of ground,\\nits forests, its various productions, were impressed on his mind.\\nHowever, after traveling for two hours, fatigue overcame him, and he\\nslept.\\n\\nAt half-past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and a short\\ntime after at the Chimneys.\\n\\nThey stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus Harding was\\nsleeping profoundly, and did not awake.\\n\\nPencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm had\\nquite altered the aspect of the place. Important changes had occurred;\\ngreat blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also covered with a\\nthick carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack. Evidently the sea, passing\\nover the islet, had been carried right up to the foot of the enormous\\ncurtain of granite. The soil in front of the cave had been torn away\\nby the violence of the waves. A horrid presentiment flashed across\\nPencroft’s mind. He rushed into the passage, but returned almost\\nimmediately, and stood motionless, staring at his companions.... The\\nfire was out; the drowned cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt\\nlinen, which was to have served as tinder, had disappeared! The sea had\\npenetrated to the end of the passages, and everything was overthrown and\\ndestroyed in the interior of the Chimneys!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\nIn a few words, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb were made acquainted\\nwith what had happened. This accident, which appeared so very serious\\nto Pencroft, produced different effects on the companions of the honest\\nsailor.\\n\\nNeb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or\\nrather, did not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying.\\n\\nHerbert shared in some degree the sailor’s feelings.\\n\\nAs to the reporter, he simply replied,--\\n\\n“Upon my word, Pencroft, it’s perfectly indifferent to me!”\\n\\n“But, I repeat, that we haven’t any fire!”\\n\\n“Pooh!”\\n\\n“Nor any means of relighting it!”\\n\\n“Nonsense!”\\n\\n“But I say, Mr. Spilett--”\\n\\n“Isn’t Cyrus here?” replied the reporter.\\n\\n“Is not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making fire\\nfor us!”\\n\\n“With what?”\\n\\n“With nothing.”\\n\\nWhat had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the bottom of\\nhis heart he shared the confidence which his companions had in Cyrus\\nHarding. The engineer was to them a microcosm, a compound of every\\nscience, a possessor of all human knowledge. It was better to be with\\nCyrus in a desert island, than without him in the most flourishing town\\nin the United States. With him they could want nothing; with him they\\nwould never despair. If these brave men had been told that a volcanic\\neruption would destroy the land, that this land would be engulfed in the\\ndepths of the Pacific, they would have imperturbably replied,--\\n\\n“Cyrus is here!”\\n\\nWhile in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed into\\nunconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been subjected during\\nhis journey had brought on, so that they could not now appeal to his\\ningenuity. The supper must necessarily be very meager. In fact, all the\\ngrouse flesh had been consumed, and there no longer existed any means of\\ncooking more game. Besides, the couroucous which had been reserved had\\ndisappeared. They must consider what was to be done.\\n\\nFirst of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central passage. There\\nthey managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained\\nalmost dry. The deep sleep which had overpowered him would no doubt be\\nmore beneficial to him than any nourishment.\\n\\nNight had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified when the\\nwind shifted to the northwest, again became extremely cold. Also, the\\nsea having destroyed the partitions which Pencroft had put up in certain\\nplaces in the passages, the Chimneys, on account of the draughts, had\\nbecome scarcely habitable. The engineer’s condition would, therefore,\\nhave been bad enough, if his companions had not carefully covered him\\nwith their coats and waistcoats.\\n\\nSupper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable\\nlithodomes, of which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply on the\\nbeach. However, to these molluscs, the lad added some edible sea-weed,\\nwhich he gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only washed by the sea\\nat the time of high tides. This sea-weed, which belongs to the order\\nof Fucacae, of the genus Sargassum, produces, when dry, a gelatinous\\nmatter, rich and nutritious. The reporter and his companions, after\\nhaving eaten a quantity of lithodomes, sucked the sargassum, of which\\nthe taste was very tolerable. It is used in parts of the East very\\nconsiderably by the natives. “Never mind!” said the sailor, “the captain\\nwill help us soon.” Meanwhile the cold became very severe, and unhappily\\nthey had no means of defending themselves from it.\\n\\nThe sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to procure fire.\\nNeb helped him in this work. He found some dry moss, and by striking\\ntogether two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being\\ninflammable enough, did not take fire, for the sparks were really only\\nincandescent, and not at all of the same consistency as those which\\nare emitted from flint when struck in the same manner. The experiment,\\ntherefore, did not succeed.\\n\\nPencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then tried\\nrubbing two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do. Certainly, the\\nmovement which he and Neb exhibited, if it had been transformed into\\nheat, according to the new theory, would have been enough to heat the\\nboiler of a steamer! It came to nothing. The bits of wood became hot, to\\nbe sure, but much less so than the operators themselves.\\n\\nAfter working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of\\nperspiration, threw down the pieces of wood in disgust.\\n\\n“I can never be made to believe that savages light their fires in this\\nway, let them say what they will,” he exclaimed. “I could sooner light\\nmy arms by rubbing them against each other!”\\n\\nThe sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding. Savages often kindle\\nwood by means of rapid rubbing. But every sort of wood does not answer\\nfor the purpose, and besides, there is “the knack,” following the usual\\nexpression, and it is probable that Pencroft had not “the knack.”\\n\\nPencroft’s ill humor did not last long. Herbert had taken the bits of\\nwood which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to rub them.\\nThe hardy sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the\\nefforts of the lad to succeed where he had failed.\\n\\n“Rub, my boy, rub!” said he.\\n\\n“I am rubbing,” replied Herbert, laughing, “but I don’t pretend to do\\nanything else but warm myself instead of shivering, and soon I shall be\\nas hot as you are, my good Pencroft!”\\n\\nThis soon happened. However, they were obliged to give up, for this\\nnight at least, the attempt to procure fire. Gideon Spilett repeated,\\nfor the twentieth time, that Cyrus Harding would not have been troubled\\nfor so small a difficulty. And, in the meantime, he stretched himself in\\none of the passages on his bed of sand. Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft did\\nthe same, while Top slept at his master’s feet.\\n\\nNext day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about eight in the\\nmorning, he saw his companions around him watching his sleep, and, as on\\nthe day before, his first words were:--\\n\\n“Island or continent?” This was his uppermost thought.\\n\\n“Well!” replied Pencroft, “we don’t know anything about it, captain!”\\n\\n“You don’t know yet?”\\n\\n“But we shall know,” rejoined Pencroft, “when you have guided us into\\nthe country.”\\n\\n“I think I am able to try it,” replied the engineer, who, without much\\neffort, rose and stood upright.\\n\\n“That’s capital!” cried the sailor.\\n\\n“I feel dreadfully weak,” replied Harding. “Give me something to eat, my\\nfriends, and it will soon go off. You have fire, haven’t you?”\\n\\nThis question was not immediately replied to. But, in a few seconds--\\n\\n“Alas! we have no fire,” said Pencroft, “or rather, captain, we have it\\nno longer!”\\n\\nAnd the sailor recounted all that had passed the day before. He amused\\nthe engineer by the history of the single match, then his abortive\\nattempt to procure fire in the savages’ way.\\n\\n“We shall consider,” replied the engineer, “and if we do not find some\\nsubstance similar to tinder--”\\n\\n“Well?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“Well, we will make matches.\\n\\n“Chemicals?”\\n\\n“Chemicals!”\\n\\n“It is not more difficult than that,” cried the reporter, striking the\\nsailor on the shoulder.\\n\\nThe latter did not think it so simple, but he did not protest. All went\\nout. The weather had become very fine. The sun was rising from the sea’s\\nhorizon, and touched with golden spangles the prismatic rugosities of\\nthe huge precipice.\\n\\nHaving thrown a rapid glance around him, the engineer seated himself on\\na block of stone. Herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell-fish and\\nsargassum, saying,--\\n\\n“It is all that we have, Captain Harding.”\\n\\n“Thanks, my boy,” replied Harding; “it will do--for this morning at\\nleast.”\\n\\nHe ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with a little\\nfresh water, drawn from the river in an immense shell.\\n\\nHis companions looked at him without speaking. Then, feeling somewhat\\nrefreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,--\\n\\n“So, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an\\nisland, or on a continent?”\\n\\n“No, captain,” replied the boy.\\n\\n“We shall know to-morrow,” said the engineer; “till then, there is\\nnothing to be done.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Fire,” said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea.\\n\\n“We will make it, Pencroft,” replied Harding.\\n\\n“While you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a\\nmountain which commands the country?”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Spilett, “a mountain which must be rather high--”\\n\\n“Well,” replied the engineer, “we will climb to the summit to-morrow,\\nand then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent. Till\\nthen, I repeat, there is nothing to be done.”\\n\\n“Yes, fire!” said the obstinate sailor again.\\n\\n“But he will make us a fire!” replied Gideon Spilett, “only have a\\nlittle patience, Pencroft!”\\n\\nThe seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, “If it\\ndepended upon you to do it, we wouldn’t taste roast meat very soon”; but\\nhe was silent.\\n\\nMeanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply. He appeared to be very\\nlittle troubled by the question of fire. For a few minutes he remained\\nabsorbed in thought; then again speaking,--\\n\\n“My friends,” said he, “our situation is, perhaps, deplorable; but, at\\nany rate, it is very plain. Either we are on a continent, and then, at\\nthe expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach some inhabited\\nplace, or we are on an island. In the latter case, if the island is\\ninhabited, we will try to get out of the scrape with the help of its\\ninhabitants; if it is desert, we will try to get out of the scrape by\\nourselves.”\\n\\n“Certainly, nothing could be plainer,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“But, whether it is an island or a continent,” asked Gideon Spilett,\\n“whereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?”\\n\\n“I cannot say exactly,” replied the engineer, “but I presume it is\\nsome land in the Pacific. In fact, when we left Richmond, the wind was\\nblowing from the northeast, and its very violence greatly proves that\\nit could not have varied. If the direction has been maintained from\\nthe northeast to the southwest, we have traversed the States of North\\nCarolina, of South Carolina, of Georgia, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico,\\nitself, in its narrow part, then a part of the Pacific Ocean. I cannot\\nestimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven\\nthousand miles, and, even supposing that the wind had varied half a\\nquarter, it must have brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava,\\neither on the Pomotous, or even, if it had a greater strength than I\\nsuppose, to the land of New Zealand. If the last hypothesis is correct,\\nit will be easy enough to get home again. English or Maoris, we shall\\nalways find some one to whom we can speak. If, on the contrary, this is\\nthe coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago, perhaps we shall\\nbe able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that peak which overlooks\\nthe country, and then we shall see how best to establish ourselves here\\nas if we are never to go away.”\\n\\n“Never?” cried the reporter. “You say ‘Never,’ my dear Cyrus?”\\n\\n“Better to put things at the worst at first,” replied the engineer, “and\\nreserve the best for a surprise.”\\n\\n“Well said,” remarked Pencroft. “It is to be hoped, too, that this\\nisland, if it be one, is not situated just out of the course of ships;\\nthat would be really unlucky!”\\n\\n“We shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first made the\\nascent of the mountain,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“But to-morrow, captain,” asked Herbert, “shall you be in a state to\\nbear the fatigue of the ascent?”\\n\\n“I hope so,” replied the engineer, “provided you and Pencroft, my boy,\\nshow yourselves quick and clever hunters.”\\n\\n“Captain,” said the sailor, “since you are speaking of game, if on my\\nreturn, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing it back--”\\n\\n“Bring it back all the same, Pencroft,” replied Harding.\\n\\nIt was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to pass the\\nday at the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the upper plateau.\\nNeb, Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the forest, renew their\\nstore of wood, and lay violent hands on every creature, feathered or\\nhairy, which might come within their reach.\\n\\nThey set out accordingly about ten o’clock in the morning, Herbert\\nconfident, Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,--\\n\\n“If, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe that\\nthe thunder itself came to light it.” All three climbed the bank; and\\narrived at the angle made by the river, the sailor, stopping, said to\\nhis two companions,--\\n\\n“Shall we begin by being hunters or wood-men?”\\n\\n“Hunters,” replied Herbert. “There is Top already in quest.”\\n\\n“We will hunt, then,” said the sailor, “and afterwards we can come back\\nand collect our wood.”\\n\\nThis agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn three\\nsticks from the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was bounding\\nabout among the long grass.\\n\\nThis time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the river,\\nplunged straight into the heart of the forest. There were still the\\nsame trees, belonging, for the most part, to the pine family. In\\ncertain places, less crowded, growing in clumps, these pines exhibited\\nconsiderable dimensions, and appeared to indicate, by their development,\\nthat the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had\\nsupposed. Glades, bristling with stumps worn away by time, were covered\\nwith dry wood, which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel. Then,\\nthe glade passed, the underwood thickened again, and became almost\\nimpenetrable.\\n\\nIt was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of trees,\\nwithout any beaten track. So the sailor from time to time broke off\\nbranches which might be easily recognized. But, perhaps, he was wrong\\nnot to follow the watercourse, as he and Herbert had done on their first\\nexcursion, for after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself.\\nTop, running under the branches, only roused birds which could not be\\napproached. Even the couroucous were invisible, and it was probable that\\nthe sailor would be obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest,\\nin which he had so happily performed his grouse fishing.\\n\\n“Well, Pencroft,” said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, “if this is\\nall the game which you promised to bring back to my master, it won’t\\nneed a large fire to roast it!”\\n\\n“Have patience,” replied the sailor, “it isn’t the game which will be\\nwanting on our return.”\\n\\n“Have you not confidence in Captain Harding?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“But you don’t believe that he will make fire?”\\n\\n“I shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the fireplace.”\\n\\n“It will blaze, since my master has said so.”\\n\\n“We shall see!”\\n\\nMeanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its course above\\nthe horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued, and was usefully\\nmarked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree whose fruit was\\nedible. This was the stone-pine, which produces an excellent almond,\\nvery much esteemed in the temperate regions of America and Europe. These\\nalmonds were in a perfect state of maturity, and Herbert described them\\nto his companions, who feasted on them.\\n\\n“Come,” said Pencroft, “sea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels for meat,\\nand almonds for dessert, that’s certainly a good dinner for those who\\nhave not a single match in their pocket!”\\n\\n“We mustn’t complain,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“I am not complaining, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “only I repeat, that\\nmeat is a little too much economized in this sort of meal.”\\n\\n“Top has found something!” cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket, in the\\nmidst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top’s barking were\\nmingled curious gruntings.\\n\\nThe sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there this\\nwas not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but rather, how\\nthey were to get hold of it.\\n\\nThe hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top engaged\\nin a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear. This\\nquadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long, of a\\nblackish brown color, lighter below, having hard scanty hair; its toes,\\nthen strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be united by a membrane.\\nHerbert recognized in this animal the capybara, that is to say, one of\\nthe largest members of the rodent order.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It stupidly\\nrolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat. Perhaps it saw men\\nfor the first time.\\n\\nHowever, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just going to\\nfell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top’s teeth, by which\\nit was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a vigorous grunt, rushed\\nupon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and disappeared in the wood.\\n\\n“The rascal!” cried Pencroft.\\n\\nAll three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they joined\\nhim the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large pond shaded\\nby venerable pines.\\n\\nNeb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into the\\nwater, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not\\nappear.\\n\\n“Let us wait,” said the boy, “for he will soon come to the surface to\\nbreathe.”\\n\\n“Won’t he drown?” asked Neb.\\n\\n“No,” replied Herbert, “since he has webbed feet, and is almost an\\namphibious animal. But watch him.”\\n\\nTop remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went to\\ndifferent parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the\\ncapybara, which the dog was looking for beneath the water.\\n\\nHerbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal appeared on the\\nsurface of the water. Top was upon it in a bound, and kept it from\\nplunging again. An instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was\\nkilled by a blow from Neb’s stick.\\n\\n“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of triumph.\\n\\n“Give me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the bones!”\\n\\nPencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by the\\nheight of the sun that it was about two o’clock, he gave the signal to\\nreturn.\\n\\nTop’s instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the intelligent\\nanimal, were enabled to discover the road by which they had come. Half\\nan hour later they arrived at the river.\\n\\nPencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though if\\nthere was no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft following the\\ncurrent, they returned towards the Chimneys.\\n\\nBut the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and again\\nuttering a tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of the cliff,--\\n\\n“Herbert! Neb! Look!” he shouted.\\n\\nSmoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\nIn a few minutes the three hunters were before a crackling fire. The\\ncaptain and the reporter were there. Pencroft looked from one to the\\nother, his capybara in his hand, without saying a word.\\n\\n“Well, yes, my brave fellow,” cried the reporter.\\n\\n“Fire, real fire, which will roast this splendid pig perfectly, and we\\nwill have a feast presently!”\\n\\n“But who lighted it?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“The sun!”\\n\\nGideon Spilett was quite right in his reply. It was the sun which\\nhad furnished the heat which so astonished Pencroft. The sailor could\\nscarcely believe his eyes, and he was so amazed that he did not think of\\nquestioning the engineer.\\n\\n“Had you a burning-glass, sir?” asked Herbert of Harding.\\n\\n“No, my boy,” replied he, “but I made one.”\\n\\nAnd he showed the apparatus which served for a burning-glass. It was\\nsimply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter’s\\nwatches. Having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive\\nby means of a little clay, he thus fabricated a regular burning-glass,\\nwhich, concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss, soon caused\\nit to blaze.\\n\\nThe sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the engineer\\nwithout saying a word, only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if\\nCyrus Harding was not a magician, he was certainly no ordinary man. At\\nlast speech returned to him, and he cried,--\\n\\n“Note that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!”\\n\\n“It is noted,” replied the reporter.\\n\\nThen, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the capybara,\\nproperly cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling-pig before a clear,\\ncrackling fire.\\n\\nThe Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because the\\npassages were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of wood and\\nmud had been re-established.\\n\\nIt was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their\\nday well. Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his strength, and\\nhad proved it by climbing to the upper plateau. From this point his eye,\\naccustomed to estimate heights and distances, was fixed for a long time\\non the cone, the summit of which he wished to reach the next day. The\\nmountain, situated about six miles to the northwest, appeared to him to\\nmeasure 3,500 feet above the level of the sea. Consequently the gaze of\\nan observer posted on its summit would extend over a radius of at least\\nfifty miles. Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve\\nthe question of “island or continent,” to which he attached so much\\nimportance.\\n\\nThey supped capitally. The flesh of the capybara was declared excellent.\\nThe sargassum and the almonds of the stone-pine completed the repast,\\nduring which the engineer spoke little. He was preoccupied with projects\\nfor the next day.\\n\\nOnce or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would be best\\nto do; but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical mind, only\\nshook his head without uttering a word.\\n\\n“To-morrow,” he repeated, “we shall know what we have to depend upon,\\nand we will act accordingly.”\\n\\nThe meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and\\nthe inhabitants of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, were soon\\nburied in a deep sleep.\\n\\nNo incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the 29th\\nof March, fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the excursion\\nwhich must determine their fate.\\n\\nAll was ready for the start. The remains of the capybara would be enough\\nto sustain Harding and his companions for at least twenty-four hours.\\n\\nBesides, they hoped to find more food on the way. As the glasses had\\nbeen returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter, Pencroft\\nburned a little linen to serve as tinder. As to flint, that would not be\\nwanting in these regions of Plutonic origin. It was half-past seven in\\nthe morning when the explorers, armed with sticks, left the Chimneys.\\nFollowing Pencroft’s advice, it appeared best to take the road already\\ntraversed through the forest, and to return by another route. It was\\nalso the most direct way to reach the mountain. They turned the south\\nangle and followed the left bank of the river, which was abandoned at\\nthe point where it formed an elbow towards the southwest. The path,\\nalready trodden under the evergreen trees, was found, and at nine\\no’clock Cyrus Harding and his companions had reached the western border\\nof the forest. The ground, till then, very little undulated, boggy at\\nfirst, dry and sandy afterwards, had a gentle slope, which ascended from\\nthe shore towards the interior of the country. A few very timid animals\\nwere seen under the forest-trees. Top quickly started them, but his\\nmaster soon called him back, for the time had not come to commence\\nhunting; that would be attended to later. The engineer was not a man who\\nwould allow himself to be diverted from his fixed idea. It might even\\nhave been said that he did not observe the country at all, either in\\nits configuration or in its natural productions, his great aim being\\nto climb the mountain before him, and therefore straight towards it he\\nwent. At ten o’clock a halt of a few minutes was made. On leaving\\nthe forest, the mountain system of the country appeared before the\\nexplorers. The mountain was composed of two cones; the first, truncated\\nat a height of about two thousand five hundred feet, was sustained by\\nbuttresses, which appeared to branch out like the talons of an immense\\nclaw set on the ground. Between these were narrow valleys, bristling\\nwith trees, the last clumps of which rose to the top of the lowest cone.\\nThere appeared to be less vegetation on that side of the mountain which\\nwas exposed to the northeast, and deep fissures could be seen which, no\\ndoubt, were watercourses.\\n\\nOn the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed a little\\non one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear. A Scotchman\\nwould have said, “His bonnet was a thocht ajee.” It appeared formed of\\nbare earth, here and there pierced by reddish rocks.\\n\\nThey wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the ridge of\\nthe spurs seemed to be the best way by which to gain it.\\n\\n“We are on volcanic ground,” Cyrus Harding had said, and his companions\\nfollowing him began to ascend by degrees on the back of a spur, which,\\nby a winding and consequently more accessible path, joined the first\\nplateau.\\n\\nThe ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force. Here and\\nthere stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and pumice-stone, were met\\nwith. In isolated groups rose fir-trees, which, some hundred feet\\nlower, at the bottom of the narrow gorges, formed massive shades almost\\nimpenetrable to the sun’s rays.\\n\\nDuring the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the footprints\\nwhich indicated the recent passage of large animals.\\n\\n“Perhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“Well,” replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in\\nIndia, and the lion in Africa, “we shall soon learn how successfully to\\nencounter them. But in the meantime we must be upon our guard!”\\n\\nThey ascended but slowly.\\n\\nThe distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not be\\nsurmounted directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground suddenly fell,\\nand they found themselves on the edge of a deep chasm which they had to\\ngo round. Thus, in retracing their steps so as to find some practicable\\npath, much time was employed and fatigue undergone for nothing. At\\ntwelve o’clock, when the small band of adventurers halted for breakfast\\nat the foot of a large group of firs, near a little stream which fell in\\ncascades, they found themselves still half way from the first plateau,\\nwhich most probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this\\npoint the view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high\\npromontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it. On\\nthe left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on the\\nnorthwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut short\\nby the ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a powerful\\nsupport of the central cone.\\n\\nAt one o’clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more towards the\\nsouthwest and again entered among thick bushes. There under the shade\\nof the trees fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the\\npheasant species. They were tragopans, ornamented by a pendant skin\\nwhich hangs over their throats, and by two small, round horns, planted\\nbehind the eyes. Among these birds, which were about the size of a fowl,\\nthe female was uniformly brown, while the male was gorgeous in his\\nred plumage, decorated with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone\\ncleverly and vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which\\nPencroft, made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.\\n\\nAfter leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by resting on\\neach other’s shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep\\nacclivity and reached a level place, with very few trees, where the soil\\nappeared volcanic. It was necessary to ascend by zigzags to make\\nthe slope more easy, for it was very steep, and the footing being\\nexceedingly precarious required the greatest caution. Neb and Herbert\\ntook the lead, Pencroft the rear, the captain and the reporter between\\nthem. The animals which frequented these heights--and there were\\nnumerous traces of them--must necessarily belong to those races of sure\\nfoot and supple spine, chamois or goat. Several were seen, but this\\nwas not the name Pencroft gave them, for all of a sudden--“Sheep!” he\\nshouted.\\n\\nAll stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a large size,\\nwith strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point, with a\\nwoolly fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color.\\n\\nThey were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the\\nmountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave the\\nname of the musmon.\\n\\n“Have they legs and chops?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“Well, then, they are sheep!” said Pencroft.\\n\\nThe animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with an\\nastonished eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time. Then\\ntheir fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over the rocks.\\n\\n“Good-bye, till we meet again,” cried Pencroft, as he watched them, in\\nsuch a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb\\ncould not help laughing.\\n\\nThe ascent was continued. Here and there were traces of lava. Sulphur\\nsprings sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go round them. In\\nsome places the sulphur had formed crystals among other substances, such\\nas whitish cinders made of an infinity of little feldspar crystals.\\n\\nIn approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the lower\\ncone, the difficulties of the ascent were very great. Towards four\\no’clock the extreme zone of the trees had been passed. There only\\nremained here and there a few twisted, stunted pines, which must have\\nhad a hard life in resisting at this altitude the high winds from the\\nopen sea. Happily for the engineer and his companions the weather was\\nbeautiful, the atmosphere tranquil; for a high breeze at an elevation of\\nthree thousand feet would have hindered their proceedings. The purity\\nof the sky at the zenith was felt through the transparent air. A perfect\\ncalm reigned around them. They could not see the sun, then hid by the\\nvast screen of the upper cone, which masked the half-horizon of the\\nwest, and whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as\\nthe radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course. Vapor--mist rather than\\nclouds--began to appear in the east, and assume all the prismatic colors\\nunder the influence of the solar rays.\\n\\nFive hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau, which\\nthey wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the\\nnight, but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles\\nby the zigzags which they had to describe. The soil, as it were, slid\\nunder their feet.\\n\\nThe slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the\\nstones worn by the air did not give a sufficient support. Evening\\ncame on by degrees, and it was almost night when Cyrus Harding and his\\ncompanions, much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours, arrived at\\nthe plateau of the first cone. It was then necessary to prepare an\\nencampment, and to restore their strength by eating first and sleeping\\nafterwards. This second stage of the mountain rose on a base of rocks,\\namong which it would be easy to find a retreat. Fuel was not abundant.\\nHowever, a fire could be made by means of the moss and dry brushwood,\\nwhich covered certain parts of the plateau. While the sailor was\\npreparing his hearth with stones which he put to this use, Neb and\\nHerbert occupied themselves with getting a supply of fuel. They soon\\nreturned with a load of brushwood. The steel was struck, the burnt linen\\ncaught the sparks of flint, and, under Neb’s breath, a crackling fire\\nshowed itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks. Their\\nobject in lighting a fire was only to enable them to withstand the cold\\ntemperature of the night, as it was not employed in cooking the bird,\\nwhich Neb kept for the next day. The remains of the capybara and\\nsome dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their supper. It was not\\nhalf-past six when all was finished.\\n\\nCyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large\\ncircular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain. Before\\ntaking any rest, he wished to know if it was possible to get round the\\nbase of the cone in the case of its sides being too steep and its summit\\nbeing inaccessible. This question preoccupied him, for it was possible\\nthat from the way the hat inclined, that is to say, towards the north,\\nthe plateau was not practicable. Also, if the summit of the mountain\\ncould not be reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could not\\nget round the base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the\\nwestern part of the country, and their object in making the ascent would\\nin part be altogether unattained.\\n\\nThe engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving Pencroft and\\nNeb to arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note the incidents of the\\nday, began to follow the edge of the plateau, going towards the north.\\nHerbert accompanied him.\\n\\nThe night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet deep. Cyrus\\nHarding and the boy walked near each other, without speaking. In\\nsome places the plateau opened before them, and they passed without\\nhindrance. In others, obstructed by rocks, there was only a narrow path,\\nin which two persons could not walk abreast. After a walk of twenty\\nminutes, Cyrus Harding and Herbert were obliged to stop. From this point\\nthe slope of the two cones became one. No shoulder here separated the\\ntwo parts of the mountain. The slope, being inclined almost seventy\\ndegrees, the path became impracticable.\\n\\nBut if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts of\\nfollowing a circular direction, in return an opportunity was given for\\nascending the cone.\\n\\nIn fact, before them opened a deep hollow. It was the rugged mouth\\nof the crater, by which the eruptive liquid matter had escaped at\\nthe periods when the volcano was still in activity. Hardened lava and\\ncrusted scoria formed a sort of natural staircase of large steps, which\\nwould greatly facilitate the ascent to the summit of the mountain.\\n\\nHarding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating, followed\\nby the lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing\\nobscurity.\\n\\nThere was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome. Would the\\ninterior acclivities of the crater be practicable? It would soon be\\nseen. The persevering engineer resolved to continue his ascent until\\nhe was stopped. Happily these acclivities wound up the interior of the\\nvolcano and favored their ascent.\\n\\nAs to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was completely\\nextinct. No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame could be seen in\\nthe dark hollows; not a roar, not a mutter, no trembling even issued\\nfrom this black well, which perhaps reached far into the bowels of the\\nearth. The atmosphere inside the crater was filled with no sulphurous\\nvapor. It was more than the sleep of a volcano; it was its complete\\nextinction. Cyrus Harding’s attempt would succeed.\\n\\nLittle by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior,\\nsaw the crater widen above their heads. The radius of this circular\\nportion of the sky, framed by the edge of the cone, increased obviously.\\nAt each step, as it were, that the explorers made, fresh stars entered\\nthe field of their vision. The magnificent constellations of the\\nsouthern sky shone resplendently. At the zenith glittered the splendid\\nAntares in the Scorpion, and not far was Alpha Centauri, which is\\nbelieved to be the nearest star to the terrestrial globe. Then, as the\\ncrater widened, appeared Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle,\\nand lastly, nearly at the Antarctic Pole, the glittering Southern Cross,\\nwhich replaces the Polar Star of the Northern Hemisphere.\\n\\nIt was nearly eight o’clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set foot on\\nthe highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the cone.\\n\\nIt was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over a\\nradius of two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it\\nconnected in the west with some continent of the Pacific? It could not\\nyet be made out. Towards the west, a cloudy belt, clearly visible at the\\nhorizon, increased the gloom, and the eye could not discover if the sky\\nand water were blended together in the same circular line.\\n\\nBut at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared, which\\ndescended slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the zenith.\\n\\nIt was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing; but its\\nlight was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line, then detached\\nfrom the cloud, and the engineer could see its reflection trembling for\\nan instant on a liquid surface. Cyrus Harding seized the lad’s hand, and\\nin a grave voice,--\\n\\n“An island!” said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent disappeared\\nbeneath the waves.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\nHalf an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the\\nencampment. The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon\\nwhich fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next day they\\nwould consult. Then each settled himself as well as he could to sleep,\\nand in that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand five hundred feet\\nabove the level of the sea, through a peaceful night, the islanders\\nenjoyed profound repose.\\n\\nThe next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which\\nconsisted solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb\\nagain to the summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to survey\\nthe island upon which he and his companions were imprisoned for life\\nperhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance from any\\nland, or if it was out of the course of vessels which visited the\\narchipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean. This time his companions followed\\nhim in the new exploration. They also wished to see the island, on the\\nproductions of which they must depend for the supply of all their wants.\\n\\nIt was about seven o’clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert,\\nPencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment. No one\\nappeared to be anxious about their situation. They had faith in\\nthemselves, doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of this\\nfaith was not the same with Harding as with his companions. The engineer\\nhad confidence, because he felt capable of extorting from this wild\\ncountry everything necessary for the life of himself and his companions;\\nthe latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them.\\nPencroft especially, since the incident of the relighted fire, would\\nnot have despaired for an instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the\\nengineer was with him on the rock.\\n\\n“Pshaw,” said he, “we left Richmond without permission from the\\nauthorities! It will be hard if we don’t manage to get away some day or\\nother from a place where certainly no one will detain us!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They went\\nround the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the mouth of\\nthe enormous chasm. The weather was magnificent. The sun rose in a pure\\nsky and flooded with his rays all the eastern side of the mountain.\\n\\nThe crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made it out to\\nbe in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening,\\nto a height of a thousand feet above the plateau. Below the chasm, large\\nthick streaks of lava wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus\\nmarked the course of the eruptive matter to the lower valleys which\\nfurrowed the northern part of the island.\\n\\nThe interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five\\nto forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent.\\nTraces of very ancient lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed\\nthe summit of the cone, before this lateral chasm had opened a new way\\nto it.\\n\\nAs to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the\\nsubterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated\\nwith the eye, for it was lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt as to\\nthe complete extinction of the volcano.\\n\\nBefore eight o’clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the\\nsummit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern\\nedge.\\n\\n“The sea, the sea everywhere!” they cried, as if their lips could not\\nrestrain the words which made islanders of them.\\n\\nThe sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around\\nthem! Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus\\nHarding had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island shore,\\nwhich he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before.\\nBut nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that is to\\nsay over a radius of more than fifty miles. No land in sight. Not a\\nsail. Over all this immense space the ocean alone was visible--the\\nisland occupied the center of a circumference which appeared to be\\ninfinite.\\n\\nThe engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for\\nsome minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme\\nlimits. Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw\\nnothing; and certainly if there had been land at the horizon, if it\\nappeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor would undoubtedly\\nhave found it out, for nature had placed regular telescopes under his\\neyebrows.\\n\\nFrom the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded\\nentirely, and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these\\nterms:\\n\\n“About what size is this island?”\\n\\nTruly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean.\\n\\nCyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the\\nperimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which\\nhe was placed; then,--\\n\\n“My friends,” said he, “I do not think I am mistaken in giving to the\\nshore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles.”\\n\\n“And consequently an area?”\\n\\n“That is difficult to estimate,” replied the engineer, “for it is so\\nuneven.”\\n\\nIf Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had\\nalmost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at\\nthe same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories,\\npoints, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the eye, and when\\nGideon Spilett, on the engineer’s advice, had drawn the outline, they\\nfound that it resembled some fantastic animal, a monstrous leviathan,\\nwhich lay sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.\\n\\nThis was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of\\nconsequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately\\ndrawn by the reporter.\\n\\nThe east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a\\nwide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high\\npoint from Pencroft on his first exploration. At the northeast two other\\ncapes closed the bay, and between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked\\nlike the half-open jaws of a formidable dog-fish.\\n\\nFrom the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like\\nthe flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of\\nprotuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part of the\\nisland, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.\\n\\nFrom this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken\\nat two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in\\na long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.\\n\\nThis tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty\\nmiles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island,\\nalready mentioned; it curled round, making an open roadstead, which\\nmarked out the lower shore of this strangely-formed land.\\n\\nAt the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek\\non the western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island\\nonly measured ten miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the\\nnortheast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest, was not less\\nthan thirty miles.\\n\\nAs to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very\\nwoody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and\\narid and sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano and the east\\ncoast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised to see a\\nlake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which they had not\\nsuspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to be on the same\\nlevel as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer explained to his\\ncompanions that the altitude of this little sheet of water must be about\\nthree hundred feet, because the plateau, which was its basin, was but a\\nprolongation of the coast.\\n\\n“Is it a freshwater lake?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Certainly,” replied the engineer, “for it must be fed by the water\\nwhich flows from the mountain.”\\n\\n“I see a little river which runs into it,” said Herbert, pointing out a\\nnarrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harding; “and since this stream feeds the lake, most\\nprobably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the\\nsurplus water escapes. We shall see that on our return.”\\n\\nThis little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned\\nconstituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to the\\neyes of the explorers. However, it was possible that under the masses of\\ntrees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an immense forest,\\nother rivers ran towards the sea. It might even be inferred that such\\nwas the case, so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent\\nspecimens of the flora of the temperate zones. There was no indication\\nof running water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant\\nwater among the marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition\\nto the downs, sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the\\nluxuriant vegetation of the rest of the island.\\n\\nThe volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary,\\nin the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two\\nzones. At the southwest, at the south, and the southeast, the first part\\nof the spurs were hidden under masses of verdure. At the north, on the\\ncontrary, one could follow their ramifications, which died away on the\\nsandy plains. It was on this side that, at the time when the mountain\\nwas in a state of eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and\\na large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the\\nnortheastern gulf.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the\\nmountain. The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in\\nrelief with different tints, green for the forests, yellow for the\\nsand, blue for the water. They viewed it in its tout-ensemble, nothing\\nremained concealed but the ground hidden by verdure, the hollows of the\\nvalleys, and the interior of the volcanic chasms.\\n\\nOne important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have\\na great effect upon the future of the castaways.\\n\\nWas the island inhabited?\\n\\nIt was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close\\nexamination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative.\\n\\nNowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group of\\nhuts, not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke curling\\nin the air betrayed the presence of man. It is true, a distance of\\nnearly thirty miles separated the observers from the extreme points,\\nthat is, of the tail which extended to the southwest, and it would have\\nbeen difficult, even to Pencroft’s eyes, to discover a habitation there.\\nNeither could the curtain of verdure, which covered three-quarters\\nof the island, be raised to see if it did not shelter some straggling\\nvillage. But in general the islanders live on the shores of the narrow\\nspaces which emerge above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore\\nappeared to be an absolute desert.\\n\\nUntil a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island\\nwas uninhabited. But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by\\nthe natives of neighboring islands? It was difficult to reply to this\\nquestion. No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles. But fifty\\nmiles could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by the large\\nPolynesian canoes. Everything depended on the position of the island,\\nof its isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes.\\nWould Cyrus Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude\\nwithout instruments? It would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it\\nwas best to take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring\\nnatives.\\n\\nThe exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its\\nfeatures made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems\\nascertained. The disposition of the forests and plains had been marked\\nin a general way on the reporter’s plan. They had now only to descend\\nthe mountain slopes again, and explore the soil, in the triple point of\\nview, of its mineral, vegetable, and animal resources.\\n\\nBut before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding\\nsaid to them in a calm, grave voice,--\\n\\n“Here, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of\\nthe Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a long time,\\nperhaps. Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes\\nby chance. I say by chance, because this is an unimportant island; there\\nis not even a port in which ships could anchor, and it is to be feared\\nthat it is situated out of the route usually followed, that is to say,\\ntoo much to the south for the ships which frequent the archipelagoes of\\nthe Pacific, and too much to the north for those which go to Australia\\nby doubling Cape Horn. I wish to hide nothing of our position from\\nyou--”\\n\\n“And you are right, my dear Cyrus,” replied the reporter, with\\nanimation. “You have to deal with men. They have confidence in you, and\\nyou can depend upon them. Is it not so, my friends?”\\n\\n“I will obey you in everything, captain,” said Herbert, seizing the\\nengineer’s hand.\\n\\n“My master always, and everywhere!” cried Neb.\\n\\n“As for me,” said the sailor, “if I ever grumble at work, my name’s not\\nJack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little America\\nof this island! We will build towns, we will establish railways, start\\ntelegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in\\norder and quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of\\nthe Union. Only, I ask one thing.”\\n\\n“What is that?” said the reporter.\\n\\n“It is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists,\\nwho have come here to settle.” Harding could not help smiling, and the\\nsailor’s idea was adopted. He then thanked his companions, and added,\\nthat he would rely on their energy and on the aid of Heaven.\\n\\n“Well, now let us set off to the Chimneys!” cried Pencroft.\\n\\n“One minute, my friends,” said the engineer. “It seems to me it would\\nbe a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes,\\npromontories, and watercourses, which we can see.\\n\\n“Very good,” said the reporter. “In the future, that will simplify the\\ninstructions which we shall have to give and follow.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” said the sailor, “already it is something to be able to say\\nwhere one is going, and where one has come from. At least, it looks like\\nsomewhere.”\\n\\n“The Chimneys, for example,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Exactly!” replied Pencroft. “That name was the most convenient, and it\\ncame to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for\\nour first encampment, captain?”\\n\\n“Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it.”\\n\\n“Good! as for the others, that will be easy,” returned the sailor, who\\nwas in high spirits. “Let us give them names, as the Robinsons did,\\nwhose story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point,\\nCape Disappointment!”\\n\\n“Or, rather, the names of Captain Harding,” said Herbert, “of Mr.\\nSpilett, of Neb!--”\\n\\n“My name!” cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.\\n\\n“Why not?” replied Pencroft. “Port Neb, that would do very well! And\\nCape Gideon--”\\n\\n“I should prefer borrowing names from our country,” said the reporter,\\n“which would remind us of America.”\\n\\n“Yes, for the principal ones,” then said Cyrus Harding; “for those of\\nthe bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to that vast bay\\non the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on\\nthe south, Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing,\\nthat of Mount Franklin; to that lake which is extended under our eyes,\\nthat of Lake Grant; nothing could be better, my friends. These names\\nwill recall our country, and those of the great citizens who have\\nhonored it; but for the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we\\nperceive from the top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which\\nwill recall their particular shape. They will impress themselves better\\non our memory, and at the same time will be more practical. The shape of\\nthe island is so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine\\nwhat it resembles. As to the streams which we do not know as yet, in\\ndifferent parts of the forest which we shall explore later, the creeks\\nwhich afterwards will be discovered, we can christen them as we find\\nthem. What do you think, my friends?”\\n\\nThe engineer’s proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions. The\\nisland was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to\\ngive names to all its angles and points. Gideon Spilett would write\\nthem down, and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be\\ndefinitely adopted. First, they named the two bays and the mountain,\\nUnion Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the engineer had\\nsuggested.\\n\\n“Now,” said the reporter, “to this peninsula at the southwest of the\\nisland, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of\\nReptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a\\nreptile’s tail.”\\n\\n“Adopted,” said the engineer.\\n\\n“Now,” said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island, “let\\nus call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark\\nGulf.”\\n\\n“Capital!” cried Pencroft, “and we can complete the resemblance by\\nnaming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape.”\\n\\n“But there are two capes,” observed the reporter.\\n\\n“Well,” replied Pencroft, “we can have North Mandible Cape and South\\nMandible Cape.”\\n\\n“They are inscribed,” said Spilett.\\n\\n“There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to\\nbe named,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“That is, the extremity of Union Bay?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“Claw Cape,” cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to some\\npart of his domain.\\n\\nIn truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like\\nthe powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly-shaped\\nisland represented.\\n\\nPencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their\\nimaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers with\\ndrinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the name of\\nthe Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet upon which the\\ncastaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island; to the plateau\\nwhich crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and from\\nwhence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of\\nProspect Heights.\\n\\nLastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine\\nPeninsula were named the forests of the Far West.\\n\\nThe nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was\\nthus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made fresh\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\nAs to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by\\nthe height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect\\nHeights to the east. But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the\\nrising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this\\nrising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly,\\nfor, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the\\nsun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and\\nnot in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those\\nplaces situated in the Northern Hemisphere.\\n\\nEverything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount\\nFranklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,--\\n\\n“Well! we are preciously stupid!”\\n\\n“Why?” asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen to\\ndepart.\\n\\n“Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!”\\n\\nHerbert was going to propose to give it the engineer’s name and all his\\ncompanions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,--\\n\\n“Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now\\nstruggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let us call it\\nLincoln Island!”\\n\\nThe engineer’s proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.\\n\\nAnd that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their\\nabsent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with\\nblood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be subdued, and\\nthat the cause of the North, the cause of justice, would triumph, thanks\\nto Grant, thanks to Lincoln!\\n\\nNow this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that sixteen\\ndays afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and\\nthat on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\nThey now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the crater,\\nthey went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous\\nnight. Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and the watches of\\nthe reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour.\\n\\nThat of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as he had\\nbeen thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves. It was an\\ninstrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the\\nreporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day.\\n\\nAs to the engineer’s watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time\\nwhich he had passed on the downs.\\n\\nThe engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun\\nthat it must be about nine o’clock in the morning, he put his watch at\\nthat hour.\\n\\n“No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time, have you\\nnot?”\\n\\n“Yes, Cyrus.”\\n\\n“Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is\\nalmost that of Washington?”\\n\\n“Undoubtedly.”\\n\\n“Very well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up very,\\nexactly, but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to us.\\n\\n“What will be the good of that?” thought the sailor.\\n\\nThey ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was\\ntotally exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply\\nthemselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very much to his taste,\\nwould know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood. Moreover,\\nthe sailor thought of simply asking the engineer to manufacture some\\npowder and one or two fowling-pieces; he supposed there would be no\\ndifficulty in that.\\n\\nOn leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return\\nto the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so\\nmagnificently framed in trees. They therefore followed the crest of one\\nof the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably\\nhad its source. In talking, the settlers already employed the names\\nwhich they had just chosen, which singularly facilitated the exchange\\nof their ideas. Herbert and Pencroft--the one young and the other very\\nboyish--were enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,\\n\\n“Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to lose\\nourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or\\nwhether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be\\ncertain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!”\\n\\nIt had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers\\nshould not stray away from each other. It was very certain that the\\nthick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it\\nwas prudent to be on their guard. In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb\\nwalked first, preceded by Top, who poked his nose into every bush. The\\nreporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett ready to note\\nevery incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping\\naside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance,\\nwhich he put into his pocket, without making any remark.\\n\\n“What can he be picking up?” muttered Pencroft. “I have looked in vain\\nfor anything that’s worth the trouble of stooping for.”\\n\\nTowards ten o’clock the little band descended the last declivities of\\nMount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and\\ntrees. They were walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a\\nplain of nearly a mile long, which extended to the edge of the wood.\\nGreat blocks of that basalt, which, according to Bischof, takes three\\nhundred and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the plain, very\\nconfused in some places. However, there were here no traces of lava,\\nwhich was spread more particularly over the northern slopes.\\n\\nCyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the\\ncreek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the\\nplain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb and the\\nsailor were hiding behind the rocks.\\n\\n“What’s the matter, my boy?” asked Spilett.\\n\\n“Smoke,” replied Herbert. “We have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred\\npaces from us.”\\n\\n“Men in this place?” cried the reporter.\\n\\n“We must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to\\ndeal,” replied Cyrus Harding. “I trust that there are no natives on this\\nisland; I dread them more than anything else. Where is Top?”\\n\\n“Top is on before.”\\n\\n“And he doesn’t bark?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“That is strange. However, we must try to call him back.”\\n\\nIn a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined\\ntheir two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the\\nheaps of basalt.\\n\\nFrom thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the\\nair.\\n\\nTop was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter,\\nsigning to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the\\nrocks. The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the result of this\\nexploration, when a shout from the engineer made them hasten forward.\\nThey soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable odor\\nwhich impregnated the atmosphere.\\n\\nThe odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what\\nthe smoke was which at first, not without cause, had startled him.\\n\\n“This fire,” said he, “or rather, this smoke is produced by nature alone.\\nThere is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats.”\\n\\n“Captain!” cried Pencroft. “What a pity that I haven’t got a cold!”\\n\\nThe settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the\\nsmoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly\\nbetween the rocks, and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid\\nodor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the air.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch.\\nHe tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its temperature, that he\\nestimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. Herbert having asked on\\nwhat he based this calculation,--\\n\\n“Its quite simple, my boy,” said he, “for, in plunging my hand into the\\nwater, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold. Therefore it has the\\nsame temperature as the human body, which is about ninety-five degrees.”\\n\\nThe sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they\\nproceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began some\\nhundred paces off.\\n\\nThere, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear\\nand limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed\\nthe presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the name of Red Creek\\nwas immediately given to the watercourse.\\n\\nIt was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain\\nwater, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over\\nthe sand, there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade,\\nran towards the lake, over a distance of a mile and a half, its breadth\\nvarying from thirty to forty feet. Its waters were sweet, and it was\\nsupposed that those of the lake were so also. A fortunate circumstance,\\nin the event of their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling\\nthan the Chimneys.\\n\\nAs to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of\\nthe creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound\\nin the temperate zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those\\nconiferae observed in that portion of the island already explored\\nto some miles from Prospect Heights. At this time of the year, the\\ncommencement of the month of April, which represents the month of\\nOctober, in this hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they\\nwere still in full leaf. They consisted principally of casuarinas and\\neucalypti, some of which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to\\nthe manna of the East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping\\nbanks, which were also covered with the high grass called “tussac” in\\nNew Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the\\nPacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude, doubtless,\\nbeing too low.\\n\\n“What a pity!” said Herbert, “such a useful tree, and which has such\\nbeautiful nuts!”\\n\\nAs to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti\\nand casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings.\\nBlack, white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors,\\nkingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red, blue lories,\\nand various other birds appeared on all sides, as through a prism,\\nfluttering about and producing a deafening clamor. Suddenly, a strange\\nconcert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket. The\\nsettlers heard successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds,\\nand a sort of clacking which they might have believed to have escaped\\nfrom the lips of a native. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush,\\nforgetting even the most elementary principles of prudence. Happily,\\nthey found there, neither a formidable wild beast nor a dangerous\\nnative, but merely half a dozen mocking and singing birds, known as\\nmountain pheasants. A few skillful blows from a stick soon put an end to\\ntheir concert, and procured excellent food for the evening’s dinner.\\n\\nHerbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings,\\nsome superbly crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at\\nPort-Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and\\nmagpies which flew away in flocks.\\n\\nA charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these\\nbirds, but the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and\\nthese primitive weapons proved very insufficient.\\n\\nTheir insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of\\nquadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular\\nflying mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a\\nheight, that one would have thought that they passed from one tree to\\nanother like squirrels.\\n\\n“Kangaroos!” cried Herbert.\\n\\n“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Stewed,” replied the reporter, “their flesh is equal to the best\\nvenison!--”\\n\\nGideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor,\\nfollowed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks. Cyrus\\nHarding called them back in vain. But it was in vain too for the hunters\\nto pursue such agile game, which went bounding away like balls. After a\\nchase of five minutes, they lost their breath, and at the same time all\\nsight of the creatures, which disappeared in the wood. Top was not more\\nsuccessful than his masters.\\n\\n“Captain,” said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had\\nrejoined them, “Captain, you see quite well we can’t get on unless we\\nmake a few guns. Will that be possible?”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” replied the engineer, “but we will begin by first\\nmanufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don’t doubt that you will\\nbecome as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters.”\\n\\n“Bows and arrows!” said Pencroft scornfully. “That’s all very well for\\nchildren!”\\n\\n“Don’t be proud, friend Pencroft,” replied the reporter. “Bows and\\narrows were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with blood.\\nPowder is but a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the human\\nrace--unhappily.”\\n\\n“Faith, that’s true, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “and I always\\nspeak too quickly. You must excuse me!”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural History,\\nreverted to the kangaroos, saying,--\\n\\n“Besides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most\\ndifficult to catch. They were giants with long gray fur; but if I am not\\nmistaken, there exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos, and rat\\nkangaroos, which are more easy to get hold of. It is reckoned that there\\nare about a dozen species.”\\n\\n“Herbert,” replied the sailor sententiously, “there is only one species\\nof kangaroos to me, that is ‘kangaroo on the spit,’ and it’s just the\\none we haven’t got this evening!”\\n\\nThey could not help laughing at Master Pencroft’s new classification.\\nThe honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to\\nthe singing pheasants, but fortune once more showed itself obliging to\\nhim.\\n\\nIn fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and ferreted\\neverywhere with an instinct doubled by a ferocious appetite. It was even\\nprobable that if some piece of game did fall into his clutches, none\\nwould be left for the hunters, if Top was hunting on his own account;\\nbut Neb watched him and he did well.\\n\\nTowards three o’clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and gruntings\\nshowed that he was engaged in a struggle with some animal. Neb rushed\\nafter him, and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a quadruped, which ten\\nseconds later would have been past recognizing in Top’s stomach. But\\nfortunately the dog had fallen upon a brood, and besides the victim he\\nwas devouring, two other rodents--the animals in question belonged to\\nthat order--lay strangled on the turf.\\n\\nNeb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand.\\nTheir size exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow, mingled\\nwith green spots, and they had the merest rudiments of tails.\\n\\nThe citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of these\\nrodents. They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger than their\\ncongeners of tropical countries, regular American rabbits, with long\\nears, jaws armed on each side with five molars, which distinguish the\\nagouti.\\n\\n“Hurrah!” cried Pencroft, “the roast has arrived! and now we can go\\nhome.”\\n\\nThe walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed. The limpid waters of\\nthe Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuarinas, banksias, and gigantic\\ngum-trees. Superb lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet. Other\\narborescent species, unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the\\nstream, which could be heard murmuring beneath the bowers of verdure.\\n\\nMeanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed that\\nthey would soon reach its mouth. In fact, on emerging from beneath a\\nthick clump of beautiful trees, it suddenly appeared before their eyes.\\n\\nThe explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant. The place\\nwas well worth looking at. This extent of water, of a circumference of\\nnearly seven miles and an area of two hundred and fifty acres, reposed\\nin a border of diversified trees. Towards the east, through a curtain\\nof verdure, picturesquely raised in some places, sparkled an horizon of\\nsea. The lake was curved at the north, which contrasted with the sharp\\noutline of its lower part. Numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores\\nof this little Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American\\nnamesake were represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some\\nhundred feet from the southern shore. There lived in harmony several\\ncouples of kingfishers perched on a stone, grave, motionless, watching\\nfor fish, then darting down, they plunged in with a sharp cry, and\\nreappeared with their prey in their beaks. On the shores and on the\\nislets, strutted wild ducks, pelicans, water-hens, red-beaks, philedons,\\nfurnished with a tongue like a brush, and one or two specimens of the\\nsplendid menura, the tail of which expands gracefully like a lyre.\\n\\nAs to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark, and from\\ncertain bubblings, and the concentric circles which crossed each other\\non the surface, it could not be doubted that it abounded in fish.\\n\\n“This lake is really beautiful!” said Gideon Spilett. “We could live on\\nits borders!”\\n\\n“We will live there!” replied Harding.\\n\\nThe settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest way,\\ndescended towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of\\nthe lake’s bank. It was not without difficulty that they broke a path\\nthrough the thickets and brushwood which had never been put aside by the\\nhand of men, and they thus went towards the shore, so as to arrive at\\nthe north of Prospect Heights. Two miles were cleared in this direction,\\nand then, after they had passed the last curtain of trees, appeared the\\nplateau, carpeted with thick turf, and beyond that the infinite sea.\\n\\nTo return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely\\nfor the space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow formed by\\nthe first detour of the Mercy. But the engineer desired to know how\\nand where the overplus of the water from the lake escaped, and the\\nexploration was prolonged under the trees for a mile and a half towards\\nthe north. It was most probable that an overfall existed somewhere, and\\ndoubtless through a cleft in the granite. This lake was only, in short,\\nan immense center basin, which was filled by degrees by the creek, and\\nits waters must necessarily pass to the sea by some fall. If it was so,\\nthe engineer thought that it might perhaps be possible to utilize this\\nfall and borrow its power, actually lost without profit to any one.\\nThey continued then to follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing the\\nplateau; but, after having gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus Harding\\nhad not been able to discover the overfall, which, however, must exist\\nsomewhere.\\n\\nIt was then half-past four. In order to prepare for dinner it was\\nnecessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling. The little\\nband retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left bank of the Mercy,\\nCyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the Chimneys.\\n\\nThe fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the functions of\\ncooks naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of Negro, to the\\nother in that of sailor, quickly prepared some broiled agouti, to which\\nthey did great justice.\\n\\nThe repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was about\\nto give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his pocket little\\nspecimens of different sorts of minerals, and just said,--\\n\\n“My friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay, this is\\nlime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is our business\\nto make a right use of them. To-morrow we will commence operations.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n“Well, captain, where are we going to begin?” asked Pencroft next\\nmorning of the engineer.\\n\\n“At the beginning,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nAnd in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin “at the very\\nbeginning.” They did not possess even the tools necessary for making\\ntools, and they were not even in the condition of nature, who, “having\\ntime, husbands her strength.” They had no time, since they had to\\nprovide for the immediate wants of their existence, and though,\\nprofiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to invent, still they\\nhad everything to make; their iron and their steel were as yet only in\\nthe state of minerals, their earthenware in the state of clay, their\\nlinen and their clothes in the state of textile material.\\n\\nIt must be said, however, that the settlers were “men” in the complete\\nand higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could not have been\\nseconded by more intelligent companions, nor with more devotion and\\nzeal. He had tried them. He knew their abilities.\\n\\nGideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything so as to\\nbe able to speak of everything, would contribute largely with his head\\nand hands to the colonization of the island. He would not draw back from\\nany task: a determined sportsman, he would make a business of what till\\nthen had only been a pleasure to him.\\n\\nHerbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the natural\\nsciences, would render greater service to the common cause.\\n\\nNeb was devotion personified. Clever, intelligent, indefatigable,\\nrobust, with iron health, he knew a little about the work of the forge,\\nand could not fail to be very useful in the colony.\\n\\nAs to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the\\ndockyards in Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the state,\\ngardener, cultivator, during his holidays, etc., and like all seamen,\\nfit for anything, he knew how to do everything.\\n\\nIt would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to\\nstruggle against fate, more certain to triumph over it.\\n\\n“At the beginning,” Cyrus Harding had said. Now this beginning of which\\nthe engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would\\nserve to transform the natural substances. The part which heat plays in\\nthese transformations is known. Now fuel, wood or coal, was ready for\\nimmediate use, an oven must be built to use it.\\n\\n“What is this oven for?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“To make the pottery which we have need of,” replied Harding.\\n\\n“And of what shall we make the oven?”\\n\\n“With bricks.”\\n\\n“And the bricks?”\\n\\n“With clay. Let us start, my friends. To save trouble, we will establish\\nour manufactory at the place of production. Neb will bring provisions,\\nand there will be no lack of fire to cook the food.”\\n\\n“No,” replied the reporter; “but if there is a lack of food for want of\\ninstruments for the chase?”\\n\\n“Ah, if we only had a knife!” cried the sailor.\\n\\n“Well?” asked Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Well! I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could be\\nplenty of game in the larder!”\\n\\n“Yes, a knife, a sharp blade.” said the engineer, as if he was speaking\\nto himself.\\n\\nAt this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on the\\nshore. Suddenly Harding’s face became animated.\\n\\n“Top, here,” said he.\\n\\nThe dog came at his master’s call. The latter took Top’s head between\\nhis hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his\\nneck, he broke it in two, saying,--\\n\\n“There are two knives, Pencroft!”\\n\\nTwo hurrahs from the sailor was the reply. Top’s collar was made of a\\nthin piece of tempered steel. They had only to sharpen it on a piece of\\nsandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone. Now sandstone was\\nabundant on the beach, and two hours after the stock of tools in the\\ncolony consisted of two sharp blades, which were easily fixed in solid\\nhandles.\\n\\nThe production of these their first tools was hailed as a triumph. It\\nwas indeed a valuable result of their labor, and a very opportune one.\\nThey set out.\\n\\nCyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western shore of\\nthe lake, where the day before he had noticed the clayey ground of which\\nhe possessed a specimen. They therefore followed the bank of the Mercy,\\ntraversed Prospect Heights, and after a walk of five miles or more they\\nreached a glade, situated two hundred feet from Lake Grant.\\n\\nOn the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which the\\nIndians of South America employ for making their bows. It was the\\ncrejimba, of the palm family, which does not bear edible fruit. Long\\nstraight branches were cut, the leaves stripped off; it was shaped,\\nstronger in the middle, more slender at the extremities, and nothing\\nremained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the bow-string.\\nThis was the “hibiscus heterophyllus,” which furnishes fibers of such\\nremarkable tenacity that they have been compared to the tendons of\\nanimals. Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable strength, for which he\\nonly wanted arrows. These were easily made with straight stiff branches,\\nwithout knots, but the points with which they must be armed, that is\\nto say, a substance to serve in lieu of iron, could not be met with so\\neasily. But Pencroft said, that having done his part of the work, chance\\nwould do the rest.\\n\\nThe settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the day\\nbefore. Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making\\nbricks and tiles, it was very useful for the work in question. There was\\nno great difficulty in it. It was enough to scour the clay with sand,\\nthen to mold the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire.\\n\\nGenerally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented himself\\nwith making them by hand. All that day and the day following were\\nemployed in this work. The clay, soaked in water, was mixed by the feet\\nand hands of the manipulators, and then divided into pieces of equal\\nsize. A practiced workman can make, without a machine, about ten\\nthousand bricks in twelve hours; but in their two days work the five\\nbrickmakers on Lincoln Island had not made more than three thousand,\\nwhich were ranged near each other, until the time when their complete\\ndesiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven, that is\\nto say, in three or four days.\\n\\nIt was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in fixing\\nthe orientation of the island, or, in other words, the precise spot\\nwhere the sun rose. The day before he had noted exactly the hour when\\nthe sun disappeared beneath the horizon, making allowance for the\\nrefraction. This morning he noted, no less exactly, the hour at which\\nit reappeared. Between this setting and rising twelve hours, twenty-four\\nminutes passed. Then, six hours, twelve minutes after its rising, the\\nsun on this day would exactly pass the meridian and the point of the sky\\nwhich it occupied at this moment would be the north. At the said hour,\\nCyrus marked this point, and putting in a line with the sun two trees\\nwhich would serve him for marks, he thus obtained an invariable meridian\\nfor his ulterior operations.\\n\\nThe settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in\\ncollecting fuel. Branches were cut all round the glade, and they picked\\nup all the fallen wood under the trees. They were also able to hunt with\\ngreater success, since Pencroft now possessed some dozen arrows armed\\nwith sharp points. It was Top who had furnished these points, by bringing\\nin a porcupine, rather inferior eating, but of great value, thanks to\\nthe quills with which it bristled. These quills were fixed firmly at the\\nends of the arrows, the flight of which was made more certain by some\\ncockatoos’ feathers. The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful\\narchers. Game of all sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys,\\ncapybaras, pigeons, agouties, grouse, etc. The greater part of these\\nanimals were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the\\nMercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance of\\nthe bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first\\nexploration.\\n\\nThis game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara hams, by\\nsmoking them above a fire of green wood, after having perfumed them with\\nsweet-smelling leaves. However, this food, although very strengthening,\\nwas always roast upon roast, and the party would have been delighted\\nto hear some soup bubbling on the hearth, but they must wait till a pot\\ncould be made, and, consequently, till the oven was built.\\n\\nDuring these excursions, which were not extended far from the\\nbrick-field, the hunters could discern the recent passage of animals of\\na large size, armed with powerful claws, but they could not recognize\\nthe species. Cyrus Harding advised them to be very careful, as the\\nforest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts.\\n\\nAnd he did right. Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an\\nanimal which resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not attack\\nthem, or they might not have escaped without a severe wound. As soon\\nas he could get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of the guns which\\nPencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make desperate war\\nagainst the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island.\\n\\nThe Chimneys during these few days was not made more comfortable, for\\nthe engineer hoped to discover, or build if necessary, a more convenient\\ndwelling. They contented themselves with spreading moss and dry leaves\\non the sand of the passages, and on these primitive couches the tired\\nworkers slept soundly.\\n\\nThey also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island, and from\\nthat time kept a regular account. The 5th of April, which was Wednesday,\\nwas twelve days from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this\\nshore.\\n\\nOn the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions were\\ncollected in the glade, at the place where they were going to perform\\nthe operation of baking the bricks. Naturally this had to be in the open\\nair, and not in a kiln, or rather, the agglomeration of bricks made an\\nenormous kiln, which would bake itself. The fuel, made of well-prepared\\nfagots, was laid on the ground and surrounded with several rows of dried\\nbricks, which soon formed an enormous cube, to the exterior of which\\nthey contrived air-holes. The work lasted all day, and it was not till\\nthe evening that they set fire to the fagots. No one slept that night,\\nall watching carefully to keep up the fire.\\n\\nThe operation lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly. It then\\nbecame necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and during this time\\nNeb and Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding, brought, on a hurdle made of\\ninterlaced branches, loads of carbonate of lime and common stones,\\nwhich were very abundant, to the north of the lake. These stones, when\\ndecomposed by heat, made a very strong quicklime, greatly increased by\\nslacking, at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination\\nof chalk or marble. Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar.\\n\\nThe result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of April,\\nthe engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some\\nthousands of bricks.\\n\\nWithout losing an instant, therefore, they began the construction of\\na kiln to bake the pottery, which was indispensable for their domestic\\nuse. They succeeded without much difficulty. Five days after, the kiln\\nwas supplied with coal, which the engineer had discovered lying open to\\nthe sky towards the mouth of the Red Creek, and the first smoke escaped\\nfrom a chimney twenty feet high. The glade was transformed into a\\nmanufactory, and Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this\\nkiln would issue all the products of modern industry.\\n\\nIn the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a common\\npottery in which to cook their food. The chief material was clay, to\\nwhich Harding added a little lime and quartz. This paste made regular\\n“pipe-clay,” with which they manufactured bowls, cups molded on stones\\nof a proper size, great jars and pots to hold water, etc. The shape of\\nthese objects was clumsy and defective, but after they had been baked\\nin a high temperature, the kitchen of the Chimneys was provided with a\\nnumber of utensils, as precious to the settlers as the most beautifully\\nenameled china. We must mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know if\\nthe clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe-clay, made some\\nlarge pipes, which he thought charming, but for which, alas! he had no\\ntobacco, and that was a great privation to Pencroft. “But tobacco\\nwill come, like everything else!” he repeated, in a burst of absolute\\nconfidence.\\n\\nThis work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well employed.\\nThe settlers, having become potters, made nothing but pottery. When\\nit suited Cyrus Harding to change them into smiths, they would become\\nsmiths. But the next day being Sunday, and also Easter Sunday, all\\nagreed to sanctify the day by rest. These Americans were religious men,\\nscrupulous observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their situation\\ncould not but develop sentiments of confidence towards the Author of all\\nthings.\\n\\nOn the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the Chimneys,\\ncarrying with them the pottery, the furnace being extinguished until\\nthey could put it to a new use. Their return was marked by a fortunate\\nincident; the engineer discovered a substance which replaced tinder.\\nIt is known that a spongy, velvety flesh is procured from a certain\\nmushroom of the genus polyporous. Properly prepared, it is extremely\\ninflammable, especially when it has been previously saturated with\\ngunpowder, or boiled in a solution of nitrate or chlorate of potash.\\nBut, till then, they had not found any of these polypores or even any of\\nthe morels which could replace them. On this day, the engineer, seeing\\na plant belonging to the wormwood genus, the principal species of which\\nare absinthe, balm-mint, tarragon, etc., gathered several tufts, and,\\npresenting them to the sailor, said,--\\n\\n“Here, Pencroft, this will please you.”\\n\\nPencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long silky hair,\\nthe leaves being clothed with soft down.\\n\\n“What’s that, captain?” asked Pencroft. “Is it tobacco?”\\n\\n“No,” replied Harding, “it is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the learned,\\nbut to us it will be tinder.”\\n\\nWhen the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very\\ninflammable substance, especially afterwards when the engineer had\\nimpregnated it with nitrate of potash, of which the island possessed\\nseveral beds, and which is in truth saltpeter.\\n\\nThe colonists had a good supper that evening. Neb prepared some agouti\\nsoup, a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled tubercules of\\nthe “caladium macrorhizum,” an herbaceous plant of the arum family.\\nThey had an excellent taste, and were very nutritious, being something\\nsimilar to the substance which is sold in England under the name of\\n“Portland sago”; they were also a good substitute for bread, which the\\nsettlers in Lincoln Island did not yet possess.\\n\\nWhen supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his companions\\nwent to take the air on the beach. It was eight o’clock in the evening;\\nthe night was magnificent. The moon, which had been full five days\\nbefore, had not yet risen, but the horizon was already silvered by those\\nsoft, pale shades which might be called the dawn of the moon. At the\\nsouthern zenith glittered the circumpolar constellations, and above all\\nthe Southern Cross, which some days before the engineer had greeted on\\nthe summit of Mount Franklin.\\n\\nCyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation, which\\nhas at its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude, at\\nits left arm a star of the second, and at its right arm a star of the\\nthird magnitude.\\n\\nThen, after some minutes thought--\\n\\n“Herbert,” he asked of the lad, “is not this the 15th of April?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“Well, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four days in\\nthe year in which the real time is identical with average time; that\\nis to say, my boy, that to-morrow, to within some seconds, the sun will\\npass the meridian just at midday by the clocks. If the weather is fine\\nI think that I shall obtain the longitude of the island with an\\napproximation of some degrees.”\\n\\n“Without instruments, without sextant?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the engineer. “Also, since the night is clear, I will\\ntry, this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating the\\nheight of the Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole above the\\nhorizon. You understand, my friends, that before undertaking the work\\nof installation in earnest it is not enough to have found out that this\\nland is an island; we must, as nearly as possible, know at what distance\\nit is situated, either from the American continent or Australia, or from\\nthe principal archipelagoes of the Pacific.”\\n\\n“In fact,” said the reporter, “instead of building a house it would\\nbe more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not more than a\\nhundred miles from an inhabited coast.”\\n\\n“That is why,” returned Harding, “I am going to try this evening to\\ncalculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to-morrow, at midday, I\\nwill try to calculate the longitude.”\\n\\nIf the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which the\\nangular distance of objects can be measured with great precision, there\\nwould have been no difficulty in the operation. This evening by the\\nheight of the pole, the next day by the passing of the sun at the\\nmeridian, he would obtain the position of the island. But as they had\\nnot one he would have to supply the deficiency.\\n\\nHarding then entered the Chimneys. By the light of the fire he cut two\\nlittle flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so as to form\\na pair of compasses, whose legs could separate or come together. The\\nfastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which was found in the\\nwood pile. This instrument finished, the engineer returned to the beach,\\nbut as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a\\nclear horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and as Claw Cape hid the southern\\nhorizon, he was obliged to look for a more suitable station. The best\\nwould evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south; but\\nthe Mercy would have to be crossed, and that was a difficulty. Harding\\nresolved, in consequence, to make his observation from Prospect Heights,\\ntaking into consideration its height above the level of the sea--a\\nheight which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process of\\nelementary geometry.\\n\\nThe settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left bank of\\nthe Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and\\nsoutheast, that is, above the curiously-shaped rocks which bordered the\\nriver.\\n\\nThis part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank, which\\nsloped away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the southern side of\\nthe island. No obstacle intercepted their gaze, which swept the horizon\\nin a semi-circle from the cape to Reptile End. To the south the horizon,\\nlighted by the first rays of the moon, was very clearly defined against\\nthe sky.\\n\\nAt this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an\\ninverted position, the star Alpha marking its base, which is nearer to\\nthe southern pole.\\n\\nThis constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole as the\\nPolar Star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about twenty-seven\\ndegrees from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made allowance for\\nit in his calculation. He took care also to observe the moment when it\\npassed the meridian below the pole, which would simplify the operation.\\n\\nCyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon, the\\nother to Alpha, and the space between the two legs gave him the angular\\ndistance which separated Alpha from the horizon. In order to fix the\\nangle obtained, he fastened with thorns the two pieces of wood on a\\nthird placed transversely, so that their separation should be properly\\nmaintained.\\n\\nThat done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the\\nobservation to the level of the sea, taking into consideration the\\ndepression of the horizon, which would necessitate measuring the height\\nof the cliff. The value of this angle would give the height of Alpha,\\nand consequently that of the pole above the horizon, that is to say, the\\nlatitude of the island, since the latitude of a point of the globe is\\nalways equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point.\\n\\nThe calculations were left for the next day, and at ten o’clock every\\none was sleeping soundly.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\n\\nThe next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers issued\\nfrom the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their linen. The\\nengineer intended to manufacture soap as soon as he could procure the\\nnecessary materials--soda or potash, fat or oil. The important question\\nof renewing their wardrobe would be treated of in the proper time and\\nplace. At any rate their clothes would last at least six months longer,\\nfor they were strong, and could resist the wear of manual labor. But\\nall would depend on the situation of the island with regard to inhabited\\nland. This would be settled to-day if the weather permitted.\\n\\nThe sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent day, one\\nof those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the\\nwarm season.\\n\\nIt was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before\\nby measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea.\\n\\n“Shall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used\\nyesterday?” said Herbert to the engineer.\\n\\n“No, my boy,” replied the latter, “we are going to proceed differently,\\nbut in as precise a way.”\\n\\nHerbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the engineer to\\nthe beach. Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter remained behind and occupied\\nthemselves in different ways.\\n\\nCyrus Harding had provided himself with a straight stick, twelve feet\\nlong, which he had measured as exactly as possible by comparing it with\\nhis own height, which he knew to a hair. Herbert carried a plumb-line\\nwhich Harding had given him, that is to say, a simple stone fastened\\nto the end of a flexible fiber. Having reached a spot about twenty feet\\nfrom the edge of the beach, and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff,\\nwhich rose perpendicularly, Harding thrust the pole two feet into\\nthe sand, and wedging it up carefully, he managed, by means of the\\nplumb-line, to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon.\\n\\n\\nThat done, he retired the necessary distance, when, lying on the sand,\\nhis eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of\\nthe cliff. He carefully marked the place with a little stick.\\n\\nThen addressing Herbert--“Do you know the first principles of geometry?”\\n he asked.\\n\\n“Slightly, captain,” replied Herbert, who did not wish to put himself\\nforward.\\n\\n“You remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Herbert; “their homologous sides are proportional.”\\n\\n“Well, my boy, I have just constructed two similar right-angled\\ntriangles; the first, the smallest, has for its sides the perpendicular\\npole, the distance which separates the little stick from the foot of the\\npole and my visual ray for hypothenuse; the second has for its sides\\nthe perpendicular cliff, the height of which we wish to measure, the\\ndistance which separates the little stick from the bottom of the\\ncliff, and my visual ray also forms its hypothenuse, which proves to be\\nprolongation of that of the first triangle.”\\n\\n“Ah, captain, I understand!” cried Herbert. “As the distance from the\\nstick to the pole is to the distance from the stick to the base of the\\ncliff, so is the height of the pole to the height of the cliff.”\\n\\n“Just so, Herbert,” replied the engineer; “and when we have measured the\\ntwo first distances, knowing the height of the pole, we shall only have\\na sum in proportion to do, which will give us the height of the cliff,\\nand will save us the trouble of measuring it directly.”\\n\\nThe two horizontal distances were found out by means of the pole, whose\\nlength above the sand was exactly ten feet.\\n\\nThe first distance was fifteen feet between the stick and the place\\nwhere the pole was thrust into the sand.\\n\\nThe second distance between the stick and the bottom of the cliff was\\nfive hundred feet.\\n\\nThese measurements finished, Cyrus Harding and the lad returned to the\\nChimneys.\\n\\nThe engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back from one\\nof his previous excursions, a sort of slate, on which it was easy\\nto trace figures with a sharp shell. He then proved the following\\nproportions:--\\n\\n\\n          15:500::10:x\\n\\n         500 x 10 = 5000\\n\\n        5000 / 15 = 333.3\\n\\n\\nFrom which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in\\nheight.\\n\\nCyrus Harding then took the instrument which he had made the evening\\nbefore, the space between its two legs giving the angular distance\\nbetween the star Alpha and the horizon. He measured, very exactly, the\\nopening of this angle on a circumference which he divided into 360 equal\\nparts. Now, this angle by adding to it the twenty-seven degrees which\\nseparated Alpha from the antarctic pole, and by reducing to the level of\\nthe sea the height of the cliff on which the observation had been made,\\nwas found to be fifty-three degrees. These fifty-three degrees being\\nsubtracted from ninety degrees--the distance from the pole to the\\nequator--there remained thirty-seven degrees. Cyrus Harding concluded,\\ntherefore, that Lincoln Island was situated on the thirty-seventh degree\\nof the southern latitude, or taking into consideration through the\\nimperfection of the performance, an error of five degrees, that it must\\nbe situated between the thirty-fifth and the fortieth parallel.\\n\\nThere was only the longitude to be obtained, and the position of the\\nisland would be determined, The engineer hoped to attempt this the same\\nday, at twelve o’clock, at which moment the sun would pass the meridian.\\n\\nIt was decided that Sunday should be spent in a walk, or rather an\\nexploring expedition, to that side of the island between the north of\\nthe lake and Shark Gulf, and if there was time they would push their\\ndiscoveries to the northern side of Cape South Mandible. They would\\nbreakfast on the downs, and not return till evening.\\n\\nAt half-past eight the little band was following the edge of the\\nchannel. On the other side, on Safety Islet, numerous birds were gravely\\nstrutting. They were divers, easily recognized by their cry, which much\\nresembles the braying of a donkey. Pencroft only considered them in\\nan eatable point of view, and learnt with some satisfaction that their\\nflesh, though blackish, is not bad food.\\n\\nGreat amphibious creatures could also be seen crawling on the sand;\\nseals, doubtless, who appeared to have chosen the islet for a place of\\nrefuge. It was impossible to think of those animals in an alimentary\\npoint of view, for their oily flesh is detestable; however, Cyrus\\nHarding observed them attentively, and without making known his idea, he\\nannounced to his companions that very soon they would pay a visit to the\\nislet. The beach was strewn with innumerable shells, some of which would\\nhave rejoiced the heart of a conchologist; there were, among others, the\\nphasianella, the terebratual, etc. But what would be of more use, was\\nthe discovery, by Neb, at low tide, of a large oysterbed among the\\nrocks, nearly five miles from the Chimneys.\\n\\n“Neb will not have lost his day,” cried Pencroft, looking at the\\nspacious oyster-bed.\\n\\n“It is really a fortunate discovery,” said the reporter, “and as it is\\nsaid that each oyster produces yearly from fifty to sixty thousand eggs,\\nwe shall have an inexhaustible supply there.”\\n\\n“Only I believe that the oyster is not very nourishing,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“No,” replied Harding. “The oyster contains very little nitrogen, and\\nif a man lived exclusively on them, he would have to eat not less than\\nfifteen to sixteen dozen a day.”\\n\\n“Capital!” replied Pencroft. “We might swallow dozens and dozens without\\nexhausting the bed. Shall we take some for breakfast?”\\n\\nAnd without waiting for a reply to this proposal, knowing that it would\\nbe approved of, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of the molluscs.\\nThey put them in a sort of net of hibiscus fiber, which Neb had\\nmanufactured, and which already contained food; they then continued to\\nclimb the coast between the downs and the sea.\\n\\nFrom time to time Harding consulted his watch, so as to be prepared in\\ntime for the solar observation, which had to be made exactly at midday.\\n\\nAll that part of the island was very barren as far as the point\\nwhich closed Union Bay, and which had received the name of Cape South\\nMandible. Nothing could be seen there but sand and shells, mingled with\\ndebris of lava. A few sea-birds frequented this desolate coast, gulls,\\ngreat albatrosses, as well as wild duck, for which Pencroft had a great\\nfancy. He tried to knock some over with an arrow, but without result,\\nfor they seldom perched, and he could not hit them on the wing.\\n\\nThis led the sailor to repeat to the engineer,--\\n\\n“You see, captain, so long as we have not one or two fowling-pieces, we\\nshall never get anything!”\\n\\n“Doubtless, Pencroft,” replied the reporter, “but it depends on you.\\nProcure us some iron for the barrels, steel for the hammers, saltpeter.\\ncoal and sulphur for powder, mercury and nitric acid for the fulminate,\\nand lead for the shot, and the captain will make us first-rate guns.”\\n\\n“Oh!” replied the engineer, “we might, no doubt, find all these\\nsubstances on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument, and needs\\nvery particular tools. However, we shall see later!”\\n\\n“Why,” cried Pencroft, “were we obliged to throw overboard all the\\nweapons we had with us in the car, all our implements, even our\\npocket-knives?”\\n\\n“But if we had not thrown them away, Pencroft, the balloon would have\\nthrown us to the bottom of the sea!” said Herbert.\\n\\n“What you say is true, my boy,” replied the sailor.\\n\\nThen passing to another idea,--“Think,” said he, “how astounded Jonathan\\nForster and his companions must have been when, next morning, they found\\nthe place empty, and the machine flown away!”\\n\\n“I am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought,”\\n said the reporter.\\n\\n“It was all my idea, that!” said Pencroft, with a satisfied air.\\n\\n“A splendid idea, Pencroft!” replied Gideon Spilett, laughing, “and\\nwhich has placed us where we are.”\\n\\n“I would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,” cried the\\nsailor, “especially since the captain has been kind enough to come and\\njoin us again.”\\n\\n“So would I, truly!” replied the reporter. “Besides, what do we want?\\nNothing.”\\n\\n“If that is not--everything!” replied Pencroft, laughing and shrugging\\nhis shoulders. “But, some day or other, we shall find means of going\\naway!”\\n\\n“Sooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends,” remarked the engineer,\\n“if Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an inhabited island,\\nor from a continent. We shall know in an hour. I have not a map of the\\nPacific, but my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of\\nits southern part. The latitude which I obtained yesterday placed New\\nZealand to the west of Lincoln Island, and the coast of Chile to the\\neast. But between these two countries, there is a distance of at least\\nsix thousand miles. It has, therefore, to be determined what point in\\nthis great space the island occupies, and this the longitude will give\\nus presently, with a sufficient approximation, I hope.”\\n\\n“Is not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us in\\nlatitude?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the engineer, “but the distance which separates us from\\nit is more than twelve hundred miles.”\\n\\n“And that way?” asked Neb, who followed the conversation with extreme\\ninterest, pointing to the south.\\n\\n“That way, nothing,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“Nothing, indeed,” added the engineer.\\n\\n“Well, Cyrus,” asked the reporter, “if Lincoln Island is not more than\\ntwo or three thousand miles from New Zealand or Chile?”\\n\\n“Well,” replied the engineer, “instead of building a house we will build\\na boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in command--”\\n\\n“Well then,” cried the sailor, “I am quite ready to be captain--as soon\\nas you can make a craft that’s able to keep at sea!”\\n\\n“We shall do it, if it is necessary,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nBut while these men, who really hesitated at nothing, were talking,\\nthe hour approached at which the observation was to be made. What Cyrus\\nHarding was to do to ascertain the passage of the sun at the meridian of\\nthe island, without an instrument of any sort, Herbert could not guess.\\n\\nThe observers were then about six miles from the Chimneys, not far from\\nthat part of the downs in which the engineer had been found after his\\nenigmatical preservation. They halted at this place and prepared for\\nbreakfast, for it was half-past eleven. Herbert went for some fresh\\nwater from a stream which ran near, and brought it back in a jug, which\\nNeb had provided.\\n\\nDuring these preparations Harding arranged everything for his\\nastronomical observation. He chose a clear place on the shore, which\\nthe ebbing tide had left perfectly level. This bed of fine sand was as\\nsmooth as ice, not a grain out of place. It was of little importance\\nwhether it was horizontal or not, and it did not matter much whether the\\nstick six feet high, which was planted there, rose perpendicularly. On\\nthe contrary, the engineer inclined it towards the south, that is to\\nsay, in the direction of the coast opposite to the sun, for it must\\nnot be forgotten that the settlers in Lincoln Island, as the island was\\nsituated in the Southern Hemisphere, saw the radiant planet describe its\\ndiurnal arc above the northern, and not above the southern horizon.\\n\\nHerbert now understood how the engineer was going to proceed to\\nascertain the culmination of the sun, that is to say its passing the\\nmeridian of the island or, in other words, determine due south. It was\\nby means of the shadow cast on the sand by the stick, a way which, for\\nwant of an instrument, would give him a suitable approach to the result\\nwhich he wished to obtain.\\n\\nIn fact, the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of length\\nwould be exactly twelve o’clock, and it would be enough to watch the\\nextremity of the shadow, so as to ascertain the instant when, after\\nhaving successively diminished, it began to lengthen. By inclining his\\nstick to the side opposite to the sun, Cyrus Harding made the shadow\\nlonger, and consequently its modifications would be more easily\\nascertained. In fact, the longer the needle of a dial is, the more\\neasily can the movement of its point be followed. The shadow of the\\nstick was nothing but the needle of a dial. The moment had come, and\\nCyrus Harding knelt on the sand, and with little wooden pegs, which he\\nstuck into the sand, he began to mark the successive diminutions of the\\nstick’s shadow. His companions, bending over him, watched the operation\\nwith extreme interest. The reporter held his chronometer in his hand,\\nready to tell the hour which it marked when the shadow would be at its\\nshortest. Moreover, as Cyrus Harding was working on the 16th of April,\\nthe day on which the true and the average time are identical, the hour\\ngiven by Gideon Spilett would be the true hour then at Washington, which\\nwould simplify the calculation. Meanwhile as the sun slowly advanced,\\nthe shadow slowly diminished, and when it appeared to Cyrus Harding that\\nit was beginning to increase, he asked, “What o’clock is it?”\\n\\n“One minute past five,” replied Gideon Spilett directly. They had now\\nonly to calculate the operation. Nothing could be easier. It could be\\nseen that there existed, in round numbers, a difference of five hours\\nbetween the meridian of Washington and that of Lincoln Island, that is\\nto say, it was midday in Lincoln Island when it was already five o’clock\\nin the evening in Washington. Now the sun, in its apparent movement\\nround the earth, traverses one degree in four minutes, or fifteen\\ndegrees an hour. Fifteen degrees multiplied by five hours give\\nseventy-five degrees.\\n\\nThen, since Washington is 77deg 3’ 11” as much as to say seventy-seven\\ndegrees counted from the meridian of Greenwich which the Americans\\ntake for their starting-point for longitudes concurrently with the\\nEnglish--it followed that the island must be situated seventy-seven and\\nseventy-five degrees west of the meridian of Greenwich, that is to say,\\non the hundred and fifty-second degree of west longitude.\\n\\nCyrus Harding announced this result to his companions, and taking into\\nconsideration errors of observation, as he had done for the latitude, he\\nbelieved he could positively affirm that the position of Lincoln Island\\nwas between the thirty-fifth and the thirty-seventh parallel, and\\nbetween the hundred and fiftieth and the hundred and fifty-fifth\\nmeridian to the west of the meridian of Greenwich.\\n\\nThe possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was,\\nit may be seen, of five degrees on both sides, which, at sixty miles\\nto a degree, would give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and\\nlongitude for the exact position.\\n\\nBut this error would not influence the determination which it was\\nnecessary to take. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was at such a\\ndistance from every country or island that it would be too hazardous to\\nattempt to reach one in a frail boat.\\n\\nIn fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred miles from\\nTahiti and the islands of the archipelago of the Pomoutous, more than\\neighteen hundred miles from New Zealand, and more than four thousand\\nfive hundred miles from the American coast!\\n\\nAnd when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not remember in\\nany way that such an island occupied, in that part of the Pacific, the\\nsituation assigned to Lincoln Island.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\nThe next day, the 17th of April, the sailor’s first words were addressed\\nto Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” he asked, “what shall we do to-day?”\\n\\n“What the captain pleases,” replied the reporter.\\n\\nTill then the engineer’s companions had been brickmakers and potters,\\nnow they were to become metallurgists.\\n\\nThe day before, after breakfast, they had explored as far as the point\\nof Mandible Cape, seven miles distant from the Chimneys. There, the long\\nseries of downs ended, and the soil had a volcanic appearance. There\\nwere no longer high cliffs as at Prospect Heights, but a strange and\\ncapricious border which surrounded the narrow gulf between the two\\ncapes, formed of mineral matter, thrown up by the volcano. Arrived at\\nthis point the settlers retraced their steps, and at nightfall entered\\nthe Chimneys; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing\\nwhether they could think of leaving Lincoln Island or not was definitely\\nsettled.\\n\\nThe twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the Pomoutous\\nIsland was a considerable distance. A boat could not cross it,\\nespecially at the approach of the bad season. Pencroft had expressly\\ndeclared this. Now, to construct a simple boat even with the necessary\\ntools, was a difficult work, and the colonists not having tools they\\nmust begin by making hammers, axes, adzes, saws, augers, planes, etc.,\\nwhich would take some time. It was decided, therefore, that they\\nwould winter at Lincoln Island, and that they would look for a more\\ncomfortable dwelling than the Chimneys, in which to pass the winter\\nmonths.\\n\\nBefore anything else could be done it was necessary to make the iron\\nore, of which the engineer had observed some traces in the northwest\\npart of the island, fit for use by converting it either into iron or\\ninto steel.\\n\\nMetals are not generally found in the ground in a pure state. For the\\nmost part they are combined with oxygen or sulphur. Such was the case\\nwith the two specimens which Cyrus Harding had brought back, one of\\nmagnetic iron, not carbonated, the other a pyrite, also called sulphuret\\nof iron. It was, therefore the first, the oxide of iron, which they must\\nreduce with coal, that is to say, get rid of the oxygen, to obtain it in\\na pure state. This reduction is made by subjecting the ore with coal to\\na high temperature, either by the rapid and easy Catalan method,\\nwhich has the advantage of transforming the ore into iron in a single\\noperation, or by the blast furnace, which first smelts the ore, then\\nchanges it into iron, by carrying away the three to four per cent. of\\ncoal, which is combined with it.\\n\\nNow Cyrus Harding wanted iron, and he wished to obtain it as soon as\\npossible. The ore which he had picked up was in itself very pure and\\nrich. It was the oxydulous iron, which is found in confused masses of a\\ndeep gray color; it gives a black dust, crystallized in the form of the\\nregular octahedron. Native lodestones consist of this ore, and iron\\nof the first quality is made in Europe from that with which Sweden and\\nNorway are so abundantly supplied. Not far from this vein was the vein\\nof coal already made use of by the settlers. The ingredients for the\\nmanufacture being close together would greatly facilitate the treatment\\nof the ore. This is the cause of the wealth of the mines in Great\\nBritain, where the coal aids the manufacture of the metal extracted from\\nthe same soil at the same time as itself.\\n\\n“Then, captain,” said Pencroft, “we are going to work iron ore?”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend,” replied the engineer, “and for that--something which\\nwill please you--we must begin by having a seal hunt on the islet.”\\n\\n“A seal hunt!” cried the sailor, turning towards Gideon Spilett. “Are\\nseals needed to make iron?”\\n\\n“Since Cyrus has said so!” replied the reporter.\\n\\nBut the engineer had already left the Chimneys, and Pencroft prepared\\nfor the seal hunt, without having received any other explanation.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb, and the sailor were\\nsoon collected on the shore, at a place where the channel left a ford\\npassable at low tide. The hunters could therefore traverse it without\\ngetting wet higher than the knee.\\n\\nHarding then put his foot on the islet for the first, and his companions\\nfor the second time.\\n\\nOn their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at them.\\nThe hunters, armed with sticks, could have killed them easily, but they\\nwere not guilty of such useless massacre, as it was important not to\\nfrighten the seals, who were lying on the sand several cable lengths\\noff. They also respected certain innocent-looking birds, whose wings\\nwere reduced to the state of stumps, spread out like fins, ornamented\\nwith feathers of a scaly appearance. The settlers, therefore, prudently\\nadvanced towards the north point, walking over ground riddled with\\nlittle holes, which formed nests for the sea-birds. Towards the\\nextremity of the islet appeared great black heads floating just above\\nthe water, having exactly the appearance of rocks in motion.\\n\\nThese were the seals which were to be captured. It was necessary,\\nhowever, first to allow them to land, for with their close, short\\nhair, and their fusiform conformation, being excellent swimmers, it is\\ndifficult to catch them in the sea, while on land their short, webbed\\nfeet prevent their having more than a slow, waddling movement.\\n\\nPencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised waiting till\\nthey were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before long, would send\\nthem to sleep. They must then manage to cut off their retreat and knock\\nthem on the head.\\n\\nThe hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks, waited\\nsilently.\\n\\nAn hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand. They could\\ncount half a dozen. Pencroft and Herbert then went round the point of\\nthe islet, so as to take them in the rear, and cut off their retreat.\\nDuring this time Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Neb, crawling behind the\\nrocks, glided towards the future scene of combat.\\n\\nAll at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared. Pencroft shouted.\\nThe engineer and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and\\nthe seals. Two of the animals soon lay dead on the sand, but the rest\\nregained the sea in safety.\\n\\n“Here are the seals required, captain!” said the sailor, advancing\\ntowards the engineer.\\n\\n“Capital,” replied Harding. “We will make bellows of them!”\\n\\n“Bellows!” cried Pencroft. “Well! these are lucky seals!”\\n\\nIt was, in fact, a blowing-machine, necessary for the treatment of\\nthe ore that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins of the\\namphibious creatures. They were of a medium size, for their length did\\nnot exceed six feet. They resembled a dog about the head.\\n\\nAs it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both the\\nanimals, Neb and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot, while Cyrus\\nHarding and the reporter continued to explore the islet.\\n\\nThe sailor and the Negro cleverly performed the operation, and three\\nhours afterwards Cyrus Harding had at his disposal two seals’ skins,\\nwhich he intended to use in this state, without subjecting them to any\\ntanning process.\\n\\nThe settlers waited till the tide was again low, and crossing the\\nchannel they entered the Chimneys.\\n\\nThe skins had then to be stretched on a frame of wood and sewn by means\\nof fibers so as to preserve the air without allowing too much to escape.\\nCyrus Harding had nothing but the two steel blades from Top’s collar,\\nand yet he was so clever, and his companions aided him with so much\\nintelligence, that three days afterwards the little colony’s stock of\\ntools was augmented by a blowing-machine, destined to inject the air\\ninto the midst of the ore when it should be subjected to heat--an\\nindispensable condition to the success of the operation.\\n\\nOn the morning of the 20th of April began the “metallic period,” as the\\nreporter called it in his notes. The engineer had decided, as has been\\nsaid, to operate near the veins both of coal and ore. Now, according to\\nhis observations, these veins were situated at the foot of the northeast\\nspurs of Mount Franklin, that is to say, a distance of six miles from\\ntheir home. It was impossible, therefore, to return every day to the\\nChimneys, and it was agreed that the little colony should camp under a\\nhut of branches, so that the important operation could be followed night\\nand day.\\n\\nThis settled, they set out in the morning. Neb and Pencroft dragged the\\nbellows on a hurdle; also a quantity of vegetables and animals, which\\nthey besides could renew on the way.\\n\\nThe road led through Jacamar Wood, which they traversed obliquely from\\nsoutheast to northwest, and in the thickest part. It was necessary to\\nbeat a path, which would in the future form the most direct road to\\nProspect Heights and Mount Franklin. The trees, belonging to the species\\nalready discovered, were magnificent. Herbert found some new ones, among\\nothers some which Pencroft called “sham leeks”; for, in spite of their\\nsize, they were of the same liliaceous family as the onion, chive,\\nshallot, or asparagus. These trees produce ligneous roots which, when\\ncooked, are excellent; from them, by fermentation, a very agreeable\\nliquor is made. They therefore made a good store of the roots.\\n\\nThe journey through the wood was long; it lasted the whole day, and so\\nallowed plenty of time for examining the flora and fauna. Top, who\\ntook special charge of the fauna, ran through the grass and brushwood,\\nputting up all sorts of game. Herbert and Gideon Spilett killed two\\nkangaroos with bows and arrows, and also an animal which strongly\\nresembled both a hedgehog and an ant-eater. It was like the first\\nbecause it rolled itself into a ball, and bristled with spines, and the\\nsecond because it had sharp claws, a long slender snout which terminated\\nin a bird’s beak, and an extendible tongue, covered with little thorns\\nwhich served to hold the insects.\\n\\n“And when it is in the pot,” asked Pencroft naturally, “what will it be\\nlike?”\\n\\n“An excellent piece of beef,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“We will not ask more from it,” replied the sailor.\\n\\nDuring this excursion they saw several wild boars, which however, did\\nnot offer to attack the little band, and it appeared as if they would\\nnot meet with any dangerous beasts; when, in a thick part of the wood,\\nthe reporter thought he saw, some paces from him, among the lower\\nbranches of a tree, an animal which he took for a bear, and which he\\nvery tranquilly began to draw. Happily for Gideon Spilett, the animal in\\nquestion did not belong to the redoubtable family of the plantigrades.\\nIt was only a koala, better known under the name of the sloth, being\\nabout the size of a large dog, and having stiff hair of a dirty color,\\nthe paws armed with strong claws, which enabled it to climb trees and\\nfeed on the leaves. Having identified the animal, which they did not\\ndisturb, Gideon Spilett erased “bear” from the title of his sketch,\\nputting koala in its place, and the journey was resumed.\\n\\nAt five o’clock in the evening, Cyrus Harding gave the signal to halt.\\nThey were now outside the forest, at the beginning of the powerful spurs\\nwhich supported Mount Franklin towards the west. At a distance of some\\nhundred feet flowed the Red Creek, and consequently plenty of fresh\\nwater was within their reach.\\n\\nThe camp was soon organized. In less than an hour, on the edge of the\\nforest, among the trees, a hut of branches interlaced with creepers,\\nand pasted over with clay, offered a tolerable shelter. Their geological\\nresearches were put off till the next day. Supper was prepared, a good\\nfire blazed before the hut, the roast turned, and at eight o’clock,\\nwhile one of the settlers watched to keep up the fire, in case any wild\\nbeasts should prowl in the neighborhood, the others slept soundly.\\n\\nThe next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Harding accompanied by Herbert,\\nwent to look for the soil of ancient formation, on which he had already\\ndiscovered a specimen of ore. They found the vein above ground, near the\\nsource of the creek, at the foot of one of the northeastern spurs. This\\nore, very rich in iron, enclosed in its fusible veinstone, was perfectly\\nsuited to the mode of reduction which the engineer intended to employ;\\nthat is, the Catalan method, but simplified, as it is used in\\nCorsica. In fact, the Catalan method, properly so called, requires the\\nconstruction of kilns and crucibles, in which the ore and the coal,\\nplaced in alternate layers, are transformed and reduced, But Cyrus\\nHarding intended to economize these constructions, and wished simply to\\nform, with the ore and the coal, a cubic mass, to the center of which he\\nwould direct the wind from his bellows. Doubtless, it was the proceeding\\nemployed by Tubalcain, and the first metallurgists of the inhabited\\nworld. Now that which had succeeded with the grandson of Adam, and which\\nstill yielded good results in countries rich in ore and fuel, could not\\nbut succeed with the settlers in Lincoln Island.\\n\\nThe coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on the\\nsurface of the ground. They first broke the ore into little pieces,\\nand cleansed them with the hand from the impurities which soiled their\\nsurface. Then coal and ore were arranged in heaps and in successive\\nlayers, as the charcoal-burner does with the wood which he wishes to\\ncarbonize. In this way, under the influence of the air projected by the\\nblowing-machine, the coal would be transformed into carbonic acid, then\\ninto oxide of carbon, its use being to reduce the oxide of iron, that is\\nto say, to rid it of the oxygen.\\n\\nThus the engineer proceeded. The bellows of sealskin, furnished at its\\nextremity with a nozzle of clay, which had been previously fabricated\\nin the pottery kiln, was established near the heap of ore. Using the\\nmechanism which consisted of a frame, cords of fiber and counterpoise,\\nhe threw into the mass an abundance of air, which by raising the\\ntemperature also concurred with the chemical transformation to produce\\nin time pure iron.\\n\\nThe operation was difficult. All the patience, all the ingenuity of the\\nsettlers was needed; but at last it succeeded, and the result was a lump\\nof iron, reduced to a spongy state, which it was necessary to shingle\\nand fagot, that is to say, to forge so as to expel from it the liquefied\\nveinstone. These amateur smiths had, of course, no hammer; but they were\\nin no worse a situation than the first metallurgist, and therefore did\\nwhat, no doubt, he had to do.\\n\\nA handle was fixed to the first lump, and was used as a hammer to forge\\nthe second on a granite anvil, and thus they obtained a coarse but\\nuseful metal. At length, after many trials and much fatigue, on the 25th\\nof April several bars of iron were forged, and transformed into tools,\\ncrowbars, pincers, pickaxes, spades, etc., which Pencroft and Neb\\ndeclared to be real jewels. But the metal was not yet in its most\\nserviceable state, that is, of steel. Now steel is a combination of iron\\nand coal, which is extracted, either from the liquid ore, by taking from\\nit the excess of coal, or from the iron by adding to it the coal which\\nwas wanting. The first, obtained by the decarburation of the metal,\\ngives natural or puddled steel; the second, produced by the carburation\\nof the iron, gives steel of cementation.\\n\\nIt was the last which Cyrus Harding intended to forge, as he possessed\\niron in a pure state. He succeeded by heating the metal with powdered\\ncoal in a crucible which had previously been manufactured from clay\\nsuitable for the purpose.\\n\\nHe then worked this steel, which is malleable both when hot or cold,\\nwith the hammer. Neb and Pencroft, cleverly directed, made hatchets,\\nwhich, heated red-hot, and plunged suddenly into cold water, acquired an\\nexcellent temper.\\n\\nOther instruments, of course roughly fashioned, were also manufactured;\\nblades for planes, axes, hatchets, pieces of steel to be transformed\\ninto saws, chisels; then iron for spades, pickaxes, hammers, nails,\\netc. At last, on the 5th of May, the metallic period ended, the smiths\\nreturned to the Chimneys, and new work would soon authorize them to take\\na fresh title.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\nIt was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of November in\\nthe countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had been obscured for\\nsome days, and it was of importance to make preparations for the winter.\\nHowever, the temperature was not as yet much lower, and a centigrade\\nthermometer, transported to Lincoln Island, would still have marked an\\naverage of ten to twelve degrees above zero. This was not surprising,\\nsince Lincoln Island, probably situated between the thirty-fifth and\\nfortieth parallel, would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to\\nthe same climate as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as\\nGreece and Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless\\nwould Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was\\nadvisable to provide against it.\\n\\nIn any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season would\\nbegin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of the\\nelements, in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and probably\\nterrible. The question of a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys\\nmust therefore be seriously considered and promptly resolved on.\\n\\nPencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which he\\nhad discovered, but he well understood that another must be found. The\\nChimneys had been already visited by the sea, under circumstances\\nwhich are known, and it would not do to be exposed again to a similar\\naccident.\\n\\n“Besides,” added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of these things\\nwith his companions, “we have some precautions to take.”\\n\\n“Why? The island is not inhabited,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“That is probable,” replied the engineer, “although we have not yet\\nexplored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear that\\ndangerous animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against a\\npossible attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every night,\\nor to keep up a fire. And then, my friends, we must foresee everything.\\nWe are here in a part of the Pacific often frequented by Malay\\npirates--”\\n\\n“What!” said Herbert, “at such a distance from land?”\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer. “These pirates are bold sailors as\\nwell as formidable enemies, and we must take measures accordingly.”\\n\\n“Well,” replied Pencroft, “we will fortify ourselves against savages\\nwith two legs as well as against savages with four. But, captain, will\\nit not be best to explore every part of the island before undertaking\\nanything else?”\\n\\n“That would be best,” added Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Who knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns\\nwhich we have searched for in vain here?”\\n\\n“That is true,” replied the engineer, “but you forget, my friends, that\\nit will be necessary to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a\\nwatercourse, and that, from the summit of Mount Franklin, we could not\\nsee towards the west, either stream or river. Here, on the contrary, we\\nare placed between the Mercy and Lake Grant, an advantage which must not\\nbe neglected. And, besides, this side, looking towards the east, is not\\nexposed as the other is to the trade-winds, which in this hemisphere\\nblow from the northwest.”\\n\\n“Then, captain,” replied the sailor, “let us build a house on the edge\\nof the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now. After having been\\nbrickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we shall surely know how to\\nbe masons!”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must consider\\nthe matter thoroughly. A natural dwelling would spare us much work,\\nand would be a surer retreat, for it would be as well defended against\\nenemies from the interior as those from outside.”\\n\\n“That is true, Cyrus,” replied the reporter, “but we have already\\nexamined all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole, not a\\ncranny!”\\n\\n“No, not one!” added Pencroft. “Ah, if we were able to dig out a\\ndwelling in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the reach\\nof harm, that would be capital! I can see that on the front which looks\\nseaward, five or six rooms--”\\n\\n“With windows to light them!” said Herbert, laughing.\\n\\n“And a staircase to climb up to them!” added Neb.\\n\\n“You are laughing,” cried the sailor, “and why? What is there impossible\\nin what I propose? Haven’t we got pickaxes and spades? Won’t Captain\\nHarding be able to make powder to blow up the mine? Isn’t it true,\\ncaptain, that you will make powder the very day we want it?”\\n\\nCyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing his\\nfanciful projects. To attack this mass of granite, even by a mine, was\\nHerculean work, and it was really vexing that nature could not help them\\nat their need. But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by\\nproposing to examine the cliff more attentively, from the mouth of the\\nriver to the angle which terminated it on the north.\\n\\nThey went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with extreme\\ncare, over an extent of nearly two miles. But in no place in the bare,\\nstraight cliff, could any cavity be found. The nests of the rock pigeons\\nwhich fluttered at its summit were only, in reality, holes bored at the\\nvery top, and on the irregular edge of the granite.\\n\\nIt was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff, either\\nwith pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient excavation, it\\nwas not to be thought of. It so happened that, on all this part of the\\nshore, Pencroft had discovered the only habitable shelter, that is to\\nsay, the Chimneys, which now had to be abandoned.\\n\\nThe exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the north angle\\nof the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which died away on the\\nshore. From this place, to its extreme limit in the west, it only formed\\na sort of declivity, a thick mass of stones, earth, and sand, bound\\ntogether by plants, bushes, and grass inclined at an angle of only\\nforty-five degrees. Clumps of trees grew on these slopes, which were\\nalso carpeted with thick grass. But the vegetation did not extend\\nfar, and a long, sandy plain, which began at the foot of these slopes,\\nreached to the beach.\\n\\nCyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of the lake\\nmust overflow on this side. The excess of water furnished by the Red\\nCreek must also escape by some channel or other. Now the engineer had\\nnot yet found this channel on any part of the shore already explored,\\nthat is to say, from the mouth of the stream on the west of Prospect\\nHeights.\\n\\nThe engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope, and to\\nreturn to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the northern\\nand eastern shores of the lake. The proposal was accepted, and in a few\\nminutes Herbert and Neb were on the upper plateau. Cyrus Harding, Gideon\\nSpilett, and Pencroft followed with more sedate steps.\\n\\nThe beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays\\nof the sun. In this direction the country was charming. The eye feasted\\non the groups of trees. Some old trunks, bent with age, showed black\\nagainst the verdant grass which covered the ground. Crowds of brilliant\\ncockatoos screamed among the branches, moving prisms, hopping from one\\nbough to another.\\n\\nThe settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the lake,\\nmade a circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join the mouth\\nof the creek on its left bank. It was a detour of more than a mile and a\\nhalf. Walking was easy, for the trees widely spread, left a considerable\\nspace between them. The fertile zone evidently stopped at this point,\\nand vegetation would be less vigorous in the part between the course of\\nthe Creek and the Mercy.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground with great\\ncare. Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points were their only\\nweapons. However, no wild beast showed itself, and it was probable that\\nthese animals frequented rather the thick forests in the south; but the\\nsettlers had the disagreeable surprise of seeing Top stop before a snake\\nof great size, measuring from fourteen to fifteen feet in length. Neb\\nkilled it by a blow from his stick. Cyrus Harding examined the reptile,\\nand declared it not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond\\nserpents which the natives of New South Wales rear. But it was possible\\nthat others existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with\\nforked tails, which rise up under the feet, or those winged snakes,\\nfurnished with two ears, which enable them to proceed with great\\nrapidity. Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile chase\\nwith such eagerness, that they feared for his safety. His master called\\nhim back directly.\\n\\nThe mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into the lake,\\nwas soon reached. The explorers recognized on the opposite shore the\\npoint which they had visited on their descent from Mount Franklin. Cyrus\\nHarding ascertained that the flow of water into it from the creek was\\nconsiderable. Nature must therefore have provided some place for the\\nescape of the overplus. This doubtless formed a fall, which, if it could\\nbe discovered, would be of great use.\\n\\nThe colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each other,\\nbegan to skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep. The water\\nappeared to be full of fish, and Pencroft resolved to make some\\nfishing-rods, so as to try and catch some.\\n\\nThe northeast point was first to be doubled. It might have been supposed\\nthat the discharge of water was at this place, for the extremity of the\\nlake was almost on a level with the edge of the plateau. But no signs of\\nthis were discovered, and the colonists continued to explore the bank,\\nwhich, after a slight bend, descended parallel to the shore.\\n\\nOn this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees, here and\\nthere, added to the picturesqueness of the country. Lake Grant was\\nviewed from thence in all its extent, and no breath disturbed the\\nsurface of its waters. Top, in beating the bushes, put up flocks of\\nbirds of different kinds, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert saluted with\\narrows. One was hit by the lad, and fell into some marshy grass. Top\\nrushed forward, and brought a beautiful swimming bird, of a slate color,\\nshort beak, very developed frontal plate, and wings edged with white. It\\nwas a “coot,” the size of a large partridge, belonging to the group of\\nmacrodactyls which form the transition between the order of wading birds\\nand that of palmipeds. Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from\\npleasant. But Top was not so particular in these things as his masters,\\nand it was agreed that the coot should be for his supper.\\n\\nThe settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake, and they\\nwould not be long in reaching the part which they already knew.\\nThe engineer was much surprised at not seeing any indication of the\\ndischarge of water. The reporter and the sailor talked with him, and he\\ncould not conceal his astonishment.\\n\\nAt this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave signs of\\nagitation. The intelligent animal went backwards and forwards on the\\nshore, stopped suddenly, and looked at the water, one paw raised, as if\\nhe was pointing at some invisible game; then he barked furiously, and\\nwas suddenly silent.\\n\\nNeither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any attention\\nto Top’s behavior; but the dog’s barking soon became so frequent that\\nthe engineer noticed it.\\n\\n“What is there, Top?” he asked.\\n\\nThe dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy, and then\\nrushed again towards the bank. Then, all at once, he plunged into the\\nlake.\\n\\n“Here, Top!” cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to venture\\ninto the treacherous water.\\n\\n“What’s happening down there?” asked Pencroft, examining the surface of\\nthe lake.\\n\\n“Top smells some amphibious creature,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“An alligator, perhaps,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“I do not think so,” replied Harding. “Alligators are only met with in\\nregions less elevated in latitude.”\\n\\nMeanwhile Top had returned at his master’s call, and had regained the\\nshore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in among the tall grass,\\nand guided by instinct, he appeared to follow some invisible being which\\nwas slipping along under the surface of the water. However the water\\nwas calm; not a ripple disturbed its surface. Several times the settlers\\nstopped on the bank, and observed it attentively. Nothing appeared.\\nThere was some mystery there.\\n\\nThe engineer was puzzled.\\n\\n“Let us pursue this exploration to the end,” said he.\\n\\nHalf an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle of the\\nlake, on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of the banks of\\nthe lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer had not been able\\nto discover how and where the waters were discharged. “There is no doubt\\nthis overflow exists,” he repeated, “and since it is not visible it must\\ngo through the granite cliff at the west!”\\n\\n“But what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear Cyrus?”\\n asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Considerable importance,” replied the engineer; “for if it flows\\nthrough the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it would be easy\\nto render habitable after turning away the water.”\\n\\n“But is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at the\\nbottom of the lake,” said Herbert, “and that it reaches the sea by some\\nsubterranean passage?”\\n\\n“That might be,” replied the engineer, “and should it be so we shall be\\nobliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not done it for\\nus.”\\n\\nThe colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to\\nthe Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation. He barked with fury,\\nand before his master could restrain him, he had plunged a second time\\ninto the lake.\\n\\nAll ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty feet off,\\nand Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head emerged from the\\nwater, which did not appear to be deep in that place.\\n\\nHerbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which the\\ntapering head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky mustaches,\\nbelonged.\\n\\n“A lamantin!” he cried.\\n\\nIt was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of\\ncetaceans, which bear the name of the “dugong,” for its nostrils were\\nopen at the upper part of its snout. The enormous animal rushed on the\\ndog, who tried to escape by returning towards the shore. His master\\ncould do nothing to save him, and before Gideon Spilett or Herbert\\nthought of bending their bows, Top, seized by the dugong, had\\ndisappeared beneath the water.\\n\\nNeb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top’s help, and\\nattack the dangerous animal in its own element.\\n\\n“No, Neb,” said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an inexplicable\\nstruggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly resist; and\\njudging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also a terrible\\nstruggle, and could not but terminate in the death of the dog! But\\nsuddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared. Thrown in\\nthe air by some unknown power, he rose ten feet above the surface of the\\nlake, fell again into the midst of the agitated waters, and then soon\\ngained the shore, without any severe wounds, miraculously saved.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What was not\\nless inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to be going on.\\nDoubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful animal, after having\\nreleased the dog, was fighting on its own account. But it did not last\\nlong. The water became red with blood, and the body of the dugong,\\nemerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around, soon stranded on\\na little beach at the south angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards\\nit. The dugong was dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen\\nfeet long, and must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At\\nits neck was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp\\nblade.\\n\\nWhat could the amphibious creature have been, who, by this terrible\\nblow had destroyed the formidable dugong? No one could tell, and much\\ninterested in this incident, Harding and his companions returned to the\\nChimneys.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\nThe next day, the 7th of May, Harding and Gideon Spilett, leaving Neb to\\nprepare breakfast, climbed Prospect Heights, while Herbert and Pencroft\\nascended by the river, to renew their store of wood.\\n\\nThe engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on which the\\ndugong had been stranded. Already flocks of birds had attacked the mass\\nof flesh, and had to be driven away with stones, for Cyrus wished to\\nkeep the fat for the use of the colony. As to the animal’s flesh\\nit would furnish excellent food, for in the islands of the Malay\\nArchipelago and elsewhere, it is especially reserved for the table of\\nthe native princes. But that was Neb’s affair.\\n\\nAt this moment Cyrus Harding had other thoughts. He was much interested\\nin the incident of the day before. He wished to penetrate the mystery\\nof that submarine combat, and to ascertain what monster could have given\\nthe dugong so strange a wound. He remained at the edge of the lake,\\nlooking, observing; but nothing appeared under the tranquil waters,\\nwhich sparkled in the first rays of the rising sun.\\n\\nAt the beach, on which lay the body of the dugong, the water was\\ntolerably shallow, but from this point the bottom of the lake sloped\\ngradually, and it was probable that the depth was considerable in the\\ncenter. The lake might be considered as a large center basin, which was\\nfilled by the water from the Red Creek.\\n\\n“Well, Cyrus,” said the reporter, “there seems to be nothing suspicious\\nin this water.”\\n\\n“No, my dear Spilett,” replied the engineer, “and I really do not know\\nhow to account for the incident of yesterday.”\\n\\n“I acknowledge,” returned Spilett, “that the wound given this creature\\nis, at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either how Top was\\nso vigorously cast up out of the water. One could have thought that a\\npowerful arm hurled him up, and that the same arm with a dagger killed\\nthe dugong!”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the engineer, who had become thoughtful; “there is\\nsomething there that I cannot understand. But do you better understand\\neither, my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved myself--how I was drawn\\nfrom the waves, and carried to the downs? No! Is it not true? Now, I\\nfeel sure that there is some mystery there, which, doubtless, we shall\\ndiscover some day. Let us observe, but do not dwell on these singular\\nincidents before our companions. Let us keep our remarks to ourselves,\\nand continue our work.”\\n\\nIt will be remembered that the engineer had not as yet been able to\\ndiscover the place where the surplus water escaped, but he knew it must\\nexist somewhere. He was much surprised to see a strong current at this\\nplace. By throwing in some bits of wood he found that it set towards the\\nsouthern angle. He followed the current, and arrived at the south point\\nof the lake.\\n\\nThere was there a sort of depression in the water, as if it was suddenly\\nlost in some fissure in the ground.\\n\\nHarding listened; placing his ear to the level of the lake, he very\\ndistinctly heard the noise of a subterranean fall.\\n\\n“There,” said he, rising, “is the discharge of the water; there,\\ndoubtless, by a passage in the granite cliff, it joins the sea, through\\ncavities which we can use to our profit. Well, I can find it!”\\n\\nThe engineer cut a long branch, stripped it of its leaves, and plunging\\nit into the angle between the two banks, he found that there was a large\\nhole one foot only beneath the surface of the water. This hole was the\\nopening so long looked for in vain, and the force of the current was\\nsuch that the branch was torn from the engineer’s hands and disappeared.\\n\\n“There is no doubt about it now,” repeated Harding. “There is the\\noutlet, and I will lay it open to view!”\\n\\n“How?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“By lowering the level of the water of the lake three feet.”\\n\\n“And how will you lower the level?”\\n\\n“By opening another outlet larger than this.”\\n\\n“At what place, Cyrus?”\\n\\n“At the part of the bank nearest the coast.”\\n\\n“But it is a mass of granite!” observed Spilett.\\n\\n“Well,” replied Cyrus Harding, “I will blow up the granite, and the\\nwater escaping, will subside, so as to lay bare this opening--”\\n\\n“And make a waterfall, by falling on to the beach,” added the reporter.\\n\\n“A fall that we shall make use of!” replied Cyrus. “Come, come!”\\n\\nThe engineer hurried away his companion, whose confidence in Harding was\\nsuch that he did not doubt the enterprise would succeed. And yet, how\\nwas this granite wall to be opened without powder, and with imperfect\\ninstruments? Was not this work upon which the engineer was so bent above\\ntheir strength?\\n\\nWhen Harding and the reporter entered the Chimneys, they found Herbert\\nand Pencroft unloading their raft of wood.\\n\\n“The woodmen have just finished, captain.” said the sailor, laughing,\\n“and when you want masons--”\\n\\n“Masons,--no, but chemists,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“Yes,” added the reporter, “we are going to blow up the island--”\\n\\n“Blow up the island?” cried Pencroft.\\n\\n“Part of it, at least,” replied Spilett.\\n\\n“Listen to me, my friends,” said the engineer. And he made known to them\\nthe result of his observations.\\n\\nAccording to him, a cavity, more or less considerable, must exist in\\nthe mass of granite which supported Prospect Heights, and he intended\\nto penetrate into it. To do this, the opening through which the water\\nrushed must first be cleared, and the level lowered by making a larger\\noutlet. Therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured, which\\nwould make a deep trench in some other part of the shore. This was what\\nHarding was going to attempt with the minerals which nature placed at\\nhis disposal.\\n\\nIt is useless to say with what enthusiasm all, especially Pencroft,\\nreceived this project. To employ great means, open the granite, create a\\ncascade, that suited the sailor. And he would just as soon be a chemist\\nas a mason or bootmaker, since the engineer wanted chemicals. He would\\nbe all that they liked, “even a professor of dancing and deportment,”\\n said he to Neb, if that was ever necessary.\\n\\nNeb and Pencroft were first of all told to extract the grease from the\\ndugong, and to keep the flesh, which was destined for food. Such perfect\\nconfidence had they in the engineer, that they set out directly,\\nwithout even asking a question. A few minutes after them, Cyrus Harding,\\nHerbert, and Gideon Spilett, dragging the hurdle, went towards the vein\\nof coals, where those shistose pyrites abound which are met with in the\\nmost recent transition soil, and of which Harding had already found a\\nspecimen. All the day being employed in carrying a quantity of these\\nstones to the Chimneys, by evening they had several tons.\\n\\nThe next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations.\\nThese shistose pyrites being composed principally of coal, flint,\\nalumina, and sulphuret of iron--the latter in excess--it was necessary\\nto separate the sulphuret of iron, and transform it into sulphate as\\nrapidly as possible. The sulphate obtained, the sulphuric acid could\\nthen be extracted.\\n\\nThis was the object to be attained. Sulphuric acid is one of the agents\\nthe most frequently employed, and the manufacturing importance of a\\nnation can be measured by the consumption which is made of it. This acid\\nwould later be of great use to the settlers, in the manufacturing of\\ncandles, tanning skins, etc., but this time the engineer reserved it for\\nanother use.\\n\\nCyrus Harding chose, behind the Chimneys, a site where the ground\\nwas perfectly level. On this ground he placed a layer of branches and\\nchopped wood, on which were piled some pieces of shistose pyrites,\\nbuttressed one against the other, the whole being covered with a thin\\nlayer of pyrites, previously reduced to the size of a nut.\\n\\nThis done, they set fire to the wood, the heat was communicated to the\\nshist, which soon kindled, since it contains coal and sulphur. Then new\\nlayers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense\\nheap, the exterior of which was covered with earth and grass, several\\nair-holes being left, as if it was a stack of wood which was to be\\ncarbonized to make charcoal.\\n\\nThey then left the transformation to complete itself, and it would\\nnot take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be\\nchanged to sulphate of iron and the alumina into sulphate of alumina,\\ntwo equally soluble substances, the others, flint, burnt coal, and\\ncinders, not being so.\\n\\nWhile this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded with\\nother operations, which were pursued with more than zeal,--it was\\neagerness.\\n\\nNeb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and placed it\\nin large earthen pots. It was then necessary to separate the glycerine\\nfrom the fat by saponifying it. Now, to obtain this result, it had to\\nbe treated either with soda or lime. In fact, one or other of these\\nsubstances, after having attacked the fat, would form a soap by\\nseparating the glycerine, and it was just this glycerine which the\\nengineer wished to obtain. There was no want of lime, only treatment by\\nlime would give calcareous soap, insoluble, and consequently useless,\\nwhile treatment by soda would furnish, on the contrary, a soluble soap,\\nwhich could be put to domestic use. Now, a practical man, like Cyrus\\nHarding, would rather try to obtain soda. Was this difficult? No; for\\nmarine plants abounded on the shore, glass-wort, ficoides, and all\\nthose fucaceae which form wrack. A large quantity of these plants\\nwas collected, first dried, then burnt in holes in the open air. The\\ncombustion of these plants was kept up for several days, and the result\\nwas a compact gray mass, which has been long known under the name of\\n“natural soda.”\\n\\nThis obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which gave both a\\nsoluble soap and that neutral substance, glycerine.\\n\\nBut this was not all. Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his future\\npreparation, another substance, nitrate of potash, which is better known\\nunder the name of salt niter, or of saltpeter.\\n\\nCyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating the\\ncarbonate of potash, which would be easily extracted from the cinders of\\nthe vegetables, by azotic acid. But this acid was wanting, and he would\\nhave been in some difficulty, if nature had not happily furnished the\\nsaltpeter, without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it\\nup. Herbert found a vein of it at the foot of Mount Franklin, and they\\nhad nothing to do but purify this salt.\\n\\nThese different works lasted a week. They were finished before\\nthe transformation of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been\\naccomplished. During the following days the settlers had time to\\nconstruct a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement, to serve for\\nthe distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been obtained. All\\nthis was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at the time when the\\nchemical transformation terminated. Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and\\nPencroft, skillfully directed by the engineer, had become most clever\\nworkmen. Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and\\nwho teaches the best.\\n\\nWhen the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the result\\nof the operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate of alumina,\\nflint, remains of coal, and cinders was placed in a basinful of water.\\nThey stirred this mixture, let it settle, then decanted it, and obtained\\na clear liquid containing in solution sulphate of iron and sulphate of\\nalumina, the other matters remaining solid, since they are insoluble.\\nLastly, this liquid being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate of\\niron were deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the\\nsulphate of alumina, was thrown away.\\n\\nCyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these sulphate\\nof iron crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be extracted. The\\nmaking of sulphuric acid is a very expensive manufacture. Considerable\\nworks are necessary--a special set of tools, an apparatus of\\nplatina, leaden chambers, unassailable by the acid, and in which the\\ntransformation is performed, etc. The engineer had none of these at his\\ndisposal, but he knew that, in Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is\\nmanufactured by very simple means, which have also the advantage of\\nproducing it to a superior degree of concentration. It is thus that the\\nacid known under the name of Nordhausen acid is made.\\n\\nTo obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation to make,\\nto calcine the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase, so that the\\nsulphuric acid should distil in vapor, which vapor, by condensation,\\nwould produce the acid.\\n\\nThe crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace would\\ndistil the sulphuric acid. The operation was successfully completed, and\\non the 20th of May, twelve days after commencing it, the engineer\\nwas the possessor of the agent which later he hoped to use in so many\\ndifferent ways.\\n\\nNow, why did he wish for this agent? Simply to produce azotic acid;\\nand that was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric acid, gives\\nazotic, or nitric, acid by distillation.\\n\\nBut, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid? His\\ncompanions were still ignorant of this, for he had not informed them of\\nthe result at which he aimed.\\n\\nHowever, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and by a\\nlast operation he would procure the substance which had given so much\\ntrouble.\\n\\nTaking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had been\\npreviously concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the water-bath, and\\nhe obtained, without even employing a refrigerant mixture, several pints\\nof an oily yellow mixture.\\n\\nThis last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired place, at\\na distance from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of an explosion,\\nand when he showed a bottle of this liquid to his friends, he contented\\nhimself with saying,--\\n\\n“Here is nitro-glycerine!”\\n\\nIt was really this terrible production, of which the explosive power is\\nperhaps tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has already caused so\\nmany accidents. However, since a way has been found to transform it into\\ndynamite, that is to say, to mix with it some solid substance, clay or\\nsugar, porous enough to hold it, the dangerous liquid has been used\\nwith some security. But dynamite was not yet known at the time when the\\nsettlers worked on Lincoln Island.\\n\\n“And is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?” said\\nPencroft incredulously.\\n\\n“Yes, my friend,” replied the engineer, “and this nitro-glycerine will\\nproduce so much the more effect, as the granite is extremely hard, and\\nwill oppose a greater resistance to the explosion.”\\n\\n“And when shall we see this, captain?”\\n\\n“To-morrow, as soon as we have dug a hole for the mine, replied the\\nengineer.”\\n\\nThe next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners went to the point\\nwhich formed the eastern shore of Lake Grant, and was only five hundred\\nfeet from the coast. At this place, the plateau inclined downwards from\\nthe waters, which were only restrained by their granite case. Therefore,\\nif this case was broken, the water would escape by the opening and form\\na stream, which, flowing over the inclined surface of the plateau,\\nwould rush on to the beach. Consequently, the level of the lake would\\nbe greatly lowered, and the opening where the water escaped would be\\nexposed, which was their final aim.\\n\\nUnder the engineer’s directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe, which\\nhe handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite. The hole was\\nmade on the point of the shore, slanting, so that it should meet a\\nmuch lower level than that of the water of the lake. In this way the\\nexplosive force, by scattering the rock, would open a large place for\\nthe water to rush out.\\n\\nThe work took some time, for the engineer, wishing to produce a great\\neffect, intended to devote not less than seven quarts of nitro-glycerine\\nto the operation. But Pencroft, relieved by Neb, did so well, that\\ntowards four o’clock in the evening, the mine was finished.\\n\\nNow the question of setting fire to the explosive substance was raised.\\nGenerally, nitro-glycerine is ignited by caps of fulminate, which in\\nbursting cause the explosion. A shock is therefore needed to produce\\nthe explosion, for, simply lighted, this substance would burn without\\nexploding.\\n\\nCyrus Harding could certainly have fabricated a percussion cap. In\\ndefault of fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance similar to\\nguncotton, since he had azotic acid at his disposal. This substance,\\npressed in a cartridge, and introduced among the nitro-glycerine, would\\nburst by means of a fuse, and cause the explosion.\\n\\nBut Cyrus Harding knew that nitro-glycerine would explode by a shock.\\nHe resolved to employ this means, and try another way, if this did not\\nsucceed.\\n\\nIn fact, the blow of a hammer on a few drops of nitro-glycerine, spread\\nout on a hard surface, was enough to create an explosion. But the\\noperator could not be there to give the blow, without becoming a victim\\nto the operation. Harding, therefore, thought of suspending a mass of\\niron, weighing several pounds, by means of a fiber, to an upright just\\nabove the mine. Another long fiber, previously impregnated with sulphur,\\nwas attached to the middle of the first, by one end, while the other lay\\non the ground several feet distant from the mine. The second fiber being\\nset on fire, it would burn till it reached the first. This catching\\nfire in its turn, would break, and the mass of iron would fall on the\\nnitro-glycerine. This apparatus being then arranged, the engineer, after\\nhaving sent his companions to a distance, filled the hole, so that the\\nnitro-glycerine was on a level with the opening; then he threw a few\\ndrops of it on the surface of the rock, above which the mass of iron was\\nalready suspended.\\n\\nThis done, Harding lit the end of the sulphured fiber, and leaving the\\nplace, he returned with his companions to the Chimneys.\\n\\nThe fiber was intended to burn five and twenty minutes, and, in fact,\\nfive and twenty minutes afterwards a most tremendous explosion was\\nheard. The island appeared to tremble to its very foundation. Stones\\nwere projected in the air as if by the eruption of a volcano. The shock\\nproduced by the displacing of the air was such, that the rocks of the\\nChimneys shook. The settlers, although they were more than two miles\\nfrom the mine, were thrown on the ground.\\n\\nThey rose, climbed the plateau, and ran towards the place where the bank\\nof the lake must have been shattered by the explosion.\\n\\nA cheer escaped them! A large rent was seen in the granite! A rapid\\nstream of water rushed foaming across the plateau and dashed down a\\nheight of three hundred feet on to the beach!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\nCyrus Harding’s project had succeeded, but, according to his usual\\nhabit he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed look, he\\nremained motionless. Herbert was in ecstasies, Neb bounded with joy,\\nPencroft nodded his great head, murmuring these words,--\\n\\n“Come, our engineer gets on capitally!”\\n\\nThe nitro-glycerine had indeed acted powerfully. The opening which it\\nhad made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through\\nthis new outlet was at least treble that which before passed through the\\nold one. The result was, that a short time after the operation the level\\nof the lake would be lowered two feet, or more.\\n\\nThe settlers went to the Chimneys to take some pickaxes, iron-tipped\\nspears, string made of fibers, flint and steel; they then returned to\\nthe plateau, Top accompanying them.\\n\\nOn the way the sailor could not help saying to the engineer,--\\n\\n“Don’t you think, captain, that by means of that charming liquid you\\nhave made, one could blow up the whole of our island?”\\n\\n“Without any doubt, the island, continents, and the world itself,”\\n replied the engineer. “It is only a question of quantity.”\\n\\n“Then could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading firearms?”\\n asked the sailor.\\n\\n“No, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would be easy\\nto make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have azotic acid,\\nsaltpeter, sulphur, and coal. Unhappily, it is the guns which we have\\nnot got.\\n\\n“Oh, captain,” replied the sailor, “with a little determination--”\\n\\nPencroft had erased the word “impossible” from the dictionary of Lincoln\\nIsland.\\n\\nThe settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went immediately\\ntowards that point of the lake near which was the old opening now\\nuncovered. This outlet had now become practicable, since the water no\\nlonger rushed through it, and it would doubtless be easy to explore the\\ninterior.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake,\\nand a glance showed them that the object had been attained.\\n\\nIn fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of the\\nwater, appeared the long-looked-for opening. A narrow ridge, left bare\\nby the retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it. This orifice\\nwas nearly twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in height. It was like\\nthe mouth of a drain at the edge of the pavement, and therefore did\\nnot offer an easy passage to the settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking\\ntheir pickaxes, soon made it of a suitable height.\\n\\nThe engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the opening,\\nin its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than from thirty to\\nthirty-five degrees. It was therefore practicable, and, provided that\\nthe declivity did not increase, it would be easy to descend even to the\\nlevel of the sea. If then, as was probable, some vast cavity existed in\\nthe interior of the granite, it might, perhaps, be of great use.\\n\\n“Well, captain, what are we stopping for?” asked the sailor, impatient\\nto enter the narrow passage. “You see Top has got before us!”\\n\\n“Very well,” replied the engineer. “But we must see our way. Neb, go and\\ncut some resinous branches.”\\n\\nNeb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines and other\\ngreen trees, and soon returned with some branches, which they made\\ninto torches. The torches were lighted with flint and steel, and Cyrus\\nHarding leading, the settlers ventured into the dark passage, which the\\noverplus of the lake had formerly filled.\\n\\nContrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the passage\\nincreased as the explorers proceeded, so that they very soon were able\\nto stand upright. The granite, worn by the water for an infinite time,\\nwas very slippery, and falls were to be dreaded. But the settlers were\\nall attached to each other by a cord, as is frequently done in ascending\\nmountains. Happily some projections of the granite, forming regular\\nsteps, made the descent less perilous. Drops, still hanging from the\\nrocks, shone here and there under the light of the torches, and\\nthe explorers guessed that the sides were clothed with innumerable\\nstalactites. The engineer examined this black granite. There was not a\\nstratum, not a break in it. The mass was compact, and of an extremely\\nclose grain. The passage dated, then, from the very origin of the\\nisland. It was not the water which little by little had hollowed it.\\nPluto and not Neptune had bored it with his own hand, and on the wall\\ntraces of an eruptive work could be distinguished, which all the washing\\nof the water had not been able totally to efface.\\n\\nThe settlers descended very slowly. They could not but feel a certain\\nawe, in this venturing into these unknown depths, for the first time\\nvisited by human beings. They did not speak, but they thought; and\\nthe thought came to more than one, that some polypus or other\\ngigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities, which were in\\ncommunication with the sea. However, Top kept at the head of the little\\nband, and they could rely on the sagacity of the dog, who would not fail\\nto give the alarm if there was any need for it.\\n\\nAfter having descended about a hundred feet, following a winding road,\\nHarding who was walking on before, stopped, and his companions came up\\nwith him. The place where they had halted was wider, so as to form a\\ncavern of moderate dimensions. Drops of water fell from the vault, but\\nthat did not prove that they oozed through the rock. They were simply\\nthe last traces left by the torrent which had so long thundered through\\nthis cavity, and the air there was pure though slightly damp, but\\nproducing no mephitic exhalation.\\n\\n“Well, my dear Cyrus,” said Gideon Spilett, “here is a very secure\\nretreat, well hid in the depths of the rock, but it is, however,\\nuninhabitable.”\\n\\n“Why uninhabitable?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“Because it is too small and too dark.”\\n\\n“Couldn’t we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light\\nand air?” replied Pencroft, who now thought nothing impossible.\\n\\n“Let us go on with our exploration,” said Cyrus Harding. “Perhaps lower\\ndown, nature will have spared us this labor.”\\n\\n“We have only gone a third of the way,” observed Herbert.\\n\\n“Nearly a third,” replied Harding, “for we have descended a hundred feet\\nfrom the opening, and it is not impossible that a hundred feet farther\\ndown--”\\n\\n“Where is Top?” asked Neb, interrupting his master.\\n\\nThey searched the cavern, but the dog was not there.\\n\\n“Most likely he has gone on,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“Let us join him,” replied Harding.\\n\\nThe descent was continued. The engineer carefully observed all the\\ndeviations of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours, he\\ncould easily have given an account of its general direction, which went\\ntowards the sea.\\n\\nThe settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their attention was\\nattracted by distant sounds which came up from the depths. They stopped\\nand listened. These sounds, carried through the passage as through an\\nacoustic tube, came clearly to the ear.\\n\\n“That is Top barking!” cried Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “and our brave dog is barking furiously!”\\n\\n“We have our iron-tipped spears,” said Cyrus Harding. “Keep on your\\nguard, and forward!”\\n\\n“It is becoming more and more interesting,” murmured Gideon Spilett in\\nthe sailor’s ear, who nodded. Harding and his companions rushed to the\\nhelp of their dog. Top’s barking became more and more perceptible,\\nand it seemed strangely fierce. Was he engaged in a struggle with some\\nanimal whose retreat he had disturbed? Without thinking of the danger\\nto which they might be exposed, the explorers were now impelled by an\\nirresistible curiosity, and in a few minutes, sixteen feet lower they\\nrejoined Top.\\n\\nThere the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern.\\n\\nTop was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously. Pencroft and\\nNeb, waving their torches, threw the light into every crevice; and\\nat the same time, Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, their spears\\nraised, were ready for any emergency which might arise. The enormous\\ncavern was empty. The settlers explored it in every direction. There was\\nnothing there, not an animal, not a human being; and yet Top continued\\nto bark. Neither caresses nor threats could make him be silent.\\n\\n“There must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the lake\\nreached the sea,” said the engineer.\\n\\n“Of course,” replied Pencroft, “and we must take care not to tumble into\\na hole.”\\n\\n“Go, Top, go!” cried Harding.\\n\\nThe dog, excited by his master’s words, ran towards the extremity of the\\ncavern, and there redoubled his barking.\\n\\nThey followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived the mouth\\nof a regular well in the granite. It was by this that the water escaped;\\nand this time it was not an oblique and practicable passage, but a\\nperpendicular well, into which it was impossible to venture.\\n\\nThe torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen. Harding\\ntook a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss. The blazing resin,\\nwhose illuminating power increased still more by the rapidity of its\\nfall, lighted up the interior of the well, but yet nothing appeared. The\\nflame then went out with a slight hiss, which showed that it had reached\\nthe water, that is to say, the level of the sea.\\n\\nThe engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was able to\\ncalculate the depth of the well, which was found to be about ninety\\nfeet.\\n\\nThe floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above the\\nlevel of the sea.\\n\\n“Here is our dwelling,” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“But it was occupied by some creature,” replied Gideon Spilett, whose\\ncuriosity was not yet satisfied.\\n\\n“Well, the creature, amphibious or otherwise, has made off through this\\nopening,” replied the engineer, “and has left the place for us.”\\n\\n“Never mind,” added the sailor, “I should like very much to be Top just\\nfor a quarter of an hour, for he doesn’t bark for nothing!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding looked at his dog, and those of his companions who were\\nnear him might have heard him murmur these words,--\\n\\n“Yes, I believe that Top knows more than we do about a great many\\nthings.”\\n\\nHowever, the wishes of the settlers were for the most part satisfied.\\nChance, aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader, had done them\\ngreat service. They had now at their disposal a vast cavern, the size\\nof which could not be properly calculated by the feeble light of their\\ntorches, but it would certainly be easy to divide it into rooms, by\\nmeans of brick partitions, or to use it, if not as a house, at least as\\na spacious apartment. The water which had left it could not return. The\\nplace was free.\\n\\nTwo difficulties remained; firstly, the possibility of lighting this\\nexcavation in the midst of solid rock; secondly, the necessity of\\nrendering the means of access more easy. It was useless to think of\\nlighting it from above, because of the enormous thickness of the granite\\nwhich composed the ceiling; but perhaps the outer wall next the sea\\nmight be pierced. Cyrus Harding, during the descent, had roughly\\ncalculated its obliqueness, and consequently the length of the passage,\\nand was therefore led to believe that the outer wall could not be very\\nthick. If light was thus obtained, so would a means of access, for\\nit would be as easy to pierce a door as windows, and to establish an\\nexterior ladder.\\n\\nHarding made known his ideas to his companions.\\n\\n“Then, captain, let us set to work!” replied Pencroft. “I have my\\npickaxe, and I shall soon make my way through this wall. Where shall I\\nstrike?”\\n\\n“Here,” replied the engineer, showing the sturdy sailor a considerable\\nrecess in the side, which would much diminish the thickness.\\n\\nPencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of the\\ntorches, he made the splinters fly around him. Neb relieved him, then\\nSpilett took Neb’s place.\\n\\nThis work had lasted two hours, and they began to fear that at this spot\\nthe wall would not yield to the pickaxe, when at a last blow given by\\nGideon Spilett, the instrument, passing through the rock, fell outside.\\n\\n“Hurrah! hurrah!” cried Pencroft.\\n\\nThe wall only measured there three feet in thickness.\\n\\nHarding applied his eye to the aperture, which overlooked the ground\\nfrom a height of eighty feet. Before him was extended the sea-coast, the\\nislet, and beyond the open sea.\\n\\nFloods of light entered by this hole, inundating the splendid cavern and\\nproducing a magic effect! On its left side it did not measure more than\\nthirty feet in height and breadth, but on the right it was enormous, and\\nits vaulted roof rose to a height of more than eighty feet.\\n\\nIn some places granite pillars, irregularly disposed, supported the\\nvaulted roof, as those in the nave of a cathedral, here forming lateral\\npiers, there elliptical arches, adorned with pointed moldings, losing\\nthemselves in dark bays, amid the fantastic arches of which glimpses\\ncould be caught in the shade, covered with a profusion of projections\\nformed like so many pendants. This cavern was a picturesque mixture of\\nall the styles of Byzantine, Roman, or Gothic architecture ever produced\\nby the hand of man. And yet this was only the work of nature. She alone\\nhad hollowed this fairy Alhambra in a mass of granite.\\n\\nThe settlers were overwhelmed with admiration. Where they had only\\nexpected to find a narrow cavity, they had found a sort of marvelous\\npalace, and Neb had taken off his hat, as if he had been transported\\ninto a temple!\\n\\nCries of admiration issued from every mouth. Hurrahs resounded, and the\\necho was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves.\\n\\n“Ah, my friends!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding, “when we have lighted the\\ninterior of this place, and have arranged our rooms and storehouses in\\nthe left part, we shall still have this splendid cavern, which we will\\nmake our study and our museum!”\\n\\n“And we will call it?--” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“Granite House,” replied Harding; a name which his companions again\\nsaluted with a cheer.\\n\\nThe torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged to return\\nby the passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was decided to put\\noff the work necessary for the arrangement of their new dwelling till\\nthe next day.\\n\\nBefore departing, Cyrus Harding leaned once more over the dark well,\\nwhich descended perpendicularly to the level of the sea. He listened\\nattentively. No noise was heard, not even that of the water, which the\\nundulations of the surge must sometimes agitate in its depths. A flaming\\nbranch was again thrown in. The sides of the well were lighted up for an\\ninstant, but as at the first time, nothing suspicious was seen.\\n\\nIf some marine monster had been surprised unawares by the retreat of the\\nwater, he would by this time have regained the sea by the subterranean\\npassage, before the new opening had been offered to him.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the engineer was standing motionless, his eyes fixed on the\\ngulf, without uttering a word.\\n\\nThe sailor approached him, and touching his arm, “Captain!” said he.\\n\\n“What do you want, my friend?” asked the engineer, as if he had returned\\nfrom the land of dreams.\\n\\n“The torches will soon go out.”\\n\\n“Forward!” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nThe little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark\\npassage. Top closed the rear, still growling every now and then. The\\nascent was painful enough. The settlers rested a few minutes in the\\nupper grotto, which made a sort of landing-place halfway up the long\\ngranite staircase. Then they began to climb again.\\n\\nSoon fresher air was felt. The drops of water, dried by evaporation, no\\nlonger sparkled on the walls. The flaring torches began to grow dim. The\\none which Neb carried went out, and if they did not wish to find their\\nway in the dark, they must hasten.\\n\\nThis was done, and a little before four o’clock, at the moment when the\\nsailor’s torch went out in its turn, Cyrus Harding and his companions\\npassed out of the passage.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\nThe next day, the 22nd of May, the arrangement of their new dwelling\\nwas commenced. In fact, the settlers longed to exchange the insufficient\\nshelter of the Chimneys for this large and healthy retreat, in the midst\\nof solid rock, and sheltered from the water both of the sea and sky.\\nTheir former dwelling was not, however, to be entirely abandoned, for\\nthe engineer intended to make a manufactory of it for important works.\\nCyrus Harding’s first care was to find out the position of the front of\\nGranite House from the outside. He went to the beach, and as the\\npickaxe when it escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen\\nperpendicularly to the foot of the cliff, the finding it would be\\nsufficient to show the place where the hole had been pierced in the\\ngranite.\\n\\nThe pickaxe was easily found, and the hole could be seen in a\\nperpendicular line above the spot where it was stuck in the sand. Some\\nrock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow opening; they\\nevidently thought that Granite House had been discovered on purpose for\\nthem. It was the engineer’s intention to divide the right portion of the\\ncavern into several rooms, preceded by an entrance passage, and to light\\nit by means of five windows and a door, pierced in the front. Pencroft\\nwas much pleased with the five windows, but he could not understand the\\nuse of the door, since the passage offered a natural staircase, through\\nwhich it would always be easy to enter Granite House.\\n\\n“My friend,” replied Harding, “if it is easy for us to reach our\\ndwelling by this passage, it will be equally easy for others besides\\nus. I mean, on the contrary, to block up that opening, to seal it\\nhermetically, and, if it is necessary, to completely hide the entrance\\nby making a dam, and thus causing the water of the lake to rise.”\\n\\n“And how shall we get in?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“By an outside ladder,” replied Cyrus Harding, “a rope ladder, which,\\nonce drawn up, will render access to our dwelling impossible.”\\n\\n“But why so many precautions?” asked Pencroft. “As yet we have seen no\\ndangerous animals. As to our island being inhabited by natives, I don’t\\nbelieve it!”\\n\\n“Are you quite sure of that, Pencroft?” asked the engineer, looking at\\nthe sailor.\\n\\n“Of course we shall not be quite sure, till we have explored it in every\\ndirection,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“Yes,” said Harding, “for we know only a small portion of it as yet. But\\nat any rate, if we have no enemies in the interior, they may come from\\nthe exterior, for parts of the Pacific are very dangerous. We must be\\nprovided against every contingency.”\\n\\nCyrus Harding spoke wisely; and without making any further objection,\\nPencroft prepared to execute his orders.\\n\\nThe front of Granite House was then to be lighted by five windows and a\\ndoor, besides a large bay window and some smaller oval ones, which would\\nadmit plenty of light to enter into the marvelous nave which was to be\\ntheir chief room. This facade, situated at a height of eighty feet above\\nthe ground, was exposed to the east, and the rising sun saluted it with\\nits first rays. It was found to be just at that part of the cliff which\\nwas between the projection at the mouth of the Mercy and a perpendicular\\nline traced above the heap of rocks which formed the Chimneys. Thus\\nthe winds from the northeast would only strike it obliquely, for it was\\nprotected by the projection. Besides, until the window-frames were made,\\nthe engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters, which\\nwould prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which could be\\nconcealed in need.\\n\\nThe first work was to make the openings. This would have taken too long\\nwith the pickaxe alone, and it is known that Harding was an ingenious\\nman. He had still a quantity of nitro-glycerine at his disposal, and he\\nemployed it usefully. By means of this explosive substance the rock was\\nbroken open at the very places chosen by the engineer. Then, with the\\npickaxe and spade, the windows and doors were properly shaped, the\\njagged edges were smoothed off, and a few days after the beginning of\\nthe work, Granite House was abundantly lighted by the rising sun,\\nwhose rays penetrated into its most secret recesses. Following the\\nplan proposed by Cyrus Harding, the space was to be divided into five\\ncompartments looking out on the sea; to the right, an entry with a\\ndoor, which would meet the ladder; then a kitchen, thirty feet long; a\\ndining-room, measuring forty feet; a sleeping-room, of equal size; and\\nlastly, a “Visitor’s room,” petitioned for by Pencroft, and which was\\nnext to the great hall. These rooms, or rather this suite of rooms,\\nwould not occupy all the depth of the cave. There would be also a\\ncorridor and a storehouse, in which their tools, provisions, and stores\\nwould be kept. All the productions of the island, the flora as well as\\nthe fauna, were to be there in the best possible state of preservation,\\nand completely sheltered from the damp. There was no want of space, so\\nthat each object could be methodically arranged. Besides, the colonists\\nhad still at their disposal the little grotto above the great cavern,\\nwhich was like the garret of the new dwelling.\\n\\nThis plan settled, it had only to be put into execution. The miners\\nbecame brickmakers again, then the bricks were brought to the foot of\\nGranite House. Till then, Harding and his companions had only entered\\nthe cavern by the long passage. This mode of communication obliged them\\nfirst to climb Prospect Heights, making a detour by the river’s bank,\\nand then to descend two hundred feet through the passage, having to\\nclimb as far when they wished to return to the plateau. This was a great\\nloss of time, and was also very fatiguing. Cyrus Harding, therefore,\\nresolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of\\na strong rope ladder, which, once raised, would render Granite House\\ncompletely inaccessible.\\n\\nThis ladder was manufactured with extreme care, and its uprights, formed\\nof the twisted fibers of a species of cane, had the strength of a thick\\ncable. As to the rounds, they were made of a sort of red cedar, with\\nlight, strong branches; and this apparatus was wrought by the masterly\\nhand of Pencroft.\\n\\nOther ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane with a\\ntackle was fixed at the door. In this way bricks could easily be\\nraised into Granite House. The transport of the materials being thus\\nsimplified, the arrangement of the interior could begin immediately.\\nThere was no want of lime, and some thousands of bricks were there\\nready to be used. The framework of the partitions was soon raised, very\\nroughly at first, and in a short time, the cave was divided into rooms\\nand storehouses, according to the plan agreed upon.\\n\\nThese different works progressed rapidly under the direction of the\\nengineer, who himself handled the hammer and the trowel. No labor came\\namiss to Cyrus Harding, who thus set an example to his intelligent and\\nzealous companions. They worked with confidence, even gaily, Pencroft\\nalways having some joke to crack, sometimes carpenter, sometimes\\nrope-maker, sometimes mason, while he communicated his good humor to\\nall the members of their little world. His faith in the engineer\\nwas complete; nothing could disturb it. He believed him capable of\\nundertaking anything and succeeding in everything. The question of boots\\nand clothes--assuredly a serious question,--that of light during the\\nwinter months, utilizing the fertile parts of the island, transforming\\nthe wild flora into cultivated flora, it all appeared easy to him; Cyrus\\nHarding helping, everything would be done in time. He dreamed of canals\\nfacilitating the transport of the riches of the ground; workings\\nof quarries and mines; machines for every industrial manufacture;\\nrailroads; yes, railroads! of which a network would certainly one day\\ncover Lincoln Island.\\n\\nThe engineer let Pencroft talk. He did not put down the aspirations of\\nthis brave heart. He knew how communicable confidence is; he even smiled\\nto hear him speak, and said nothing of the uneasiness for the future\\nwhich he felt. In fact, in that part of the Pacific, out of the course\\nof vessels, it was to be feared that no help would ever come to them. It\\nwas on themselves, on themselves alone, that the settlers must depend,\\nfor the distance of Lincoln Island from all other land was such, that\\nto hazard themselves in a boat, of a necessarily inferior construction,\\nwould be a serious and perilous thing.\\n\\n“But,” as the sailor said, “they quite took the wind out of the sails of\\nthe Robinsons, for whom everything was done by a miracle.”\\n\\nIn fact, they were energetic; an energetic man will succeed where an\\nindolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish.\\n\\nHerbert distinguished himself in these works. He was intelligent and\\nactive; understanding quickly, he performed well; and Cyrus Harding\\nbecame more and more attached to the boy. Herbert had a lively and\\nreverent love for the engineer. Pencroft saw the close sympathy which\\nexisted between the two, but he was not in the least jealous. Neb\\nwas Neb: he was what he would be always, courage, zeal, devotion,\\nself-denial personified. He had the same faith in his master that\\nPencroft had, but he showed it less vehemently. When the sailor was\\nenthusiastic, Neb always looked as if he would say, “Nothing could be\\nmore natural.” Pencroft and he were great friends.\\n\\nAs to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work, and was not less\\nskilful in it than his companions, which always rather astonished\\nthe sailor. A “journalist,” clever, not only in understanding, but in\\nperforming everything.\\n\\nThe ladder was finally fixed on the 28th of May. There were not less\\nthan a hundred rounds in this perpendicular height of eighty feet.\\nHarding had been able, fortunately, to divide it in two parts, profiting\\nby an overhanging of the cliff which made a projection forty feet above\\nthe ground. This projection, carefully leveled by the pickaxe, made a\\nsort of platform, to which they fixed the first ladder, of which the\\noscillation was thus diminished one-half, and a rope permitted it to be\\nraised to the level of Granite House. As to the second ladder, it was\\nsecured both at its lower part, which rested on the projection, and at\\nits upper end, which was fastened to the door. In short the ascent had\\nbeen made much easier. Besides, Cyrus Harding hoped later to establish\\nan hydraulic apparatus, which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time,\\nfor the inhabitants of Granite House.\\n\\nThe settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder. They were\\nlight and active, and Pencroft, as a sailor, accustomed to run up\\nthe masts and shrouds, was able to give them lessons. But it was also\\nnecessary to give them to Top. The poor dog, with his four paws, was\\nnot formed for this sort of exercise. But Pencroft was such a zealous\\nmaster, that Top ended by properly performing his ascents, and soon\\nmounted the ladder as readily as his brethren in the circus. It need not\\nbe said that the sailor was proud of his pupil. However, more than once\\nPencroft hoisted him on his back, which Top never complained of.\\n\\nIt must be mentioned here, that during these works, which were actively\\nconducted, for the bad season was approaching, the alimentary question\\nwas not neglected. Every day, the reporter and Herbert, who had been\\nvoted purveyors to the colony, devoted some hours to the chase. As yet,\\nthey only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on the left of the river, because, for\\nwant of a bridge or boat, the Mercy had not yet been crossed. All the\\nimmense woods, to which the name of the Forests of the Far West had been\\ngiven, were not explored. They reserved this important excursion for the\\nfirst fine days of the next spring. But Jacamar Wood was full of game;\\nkangaroos and boars abounded, and the hunters’ iron-tipped spears and\\nbows and arrows did wonders. Besides, Herbert discovered towards the\\nsouthwest point of the lagoon a natural warren, a slightly damp meadow,\\ncovered with willows and aromatic herbs which scented the air, such\\nas thyme, basil, savory, all the sweet-scented species of the labiated\\nplants, which the rabbits appeared to be particularly fond of.\\n\\nOn the reporter observing that since the table was spread for the\\nrabbits, it was strange that the rabbits themselves should be wanting,\\nthe two sportsmen carefully explored the warren. At any rate, it\\nproduced an abundance of useful plants, and a naturalist would have had\\na good opportunity of studying many specimens of the vegetable kingdom.\\nHerbert gathered several shoots of the basil, rosemary, balm, betony,\\netc., which possess different medicinal properties, some pectoral,\\nastringent, febrifuge, others anti-spasmodic, or anti-rheumatic. When,\\nafterwards, Pencroft asked the use of this collection of herbs,--\\n\\n“For medicine,” replied the lad, “to treat us when we are ill.”\\n\\n“Why should we be ill, since there are no doctors in the island?” asked\\nPencroft quite seriously.\\n\\nThere was no reply to be made to that, but the lad went on with his\\ncollection all the same, and it was well received at Granite House.\\nBesides these medicinal herbs, he added a plant known in North America\\nas “Oswego tea,” which made an excellent beverage.\\n\\nAt last, by searching thoroughly, the hunters arrived at the real site\\nof the warren. There the ground was perforated like a sieve.\\n\\n“Here are the burrows!” cried Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the reporter, “so I see.”\\n\\n“But are they inhabited?”\\n\\n“That is the question.”\\n\\nThis was soon answered. Almost immediately, hundreds of little animals,\\nsimilar to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such rapidity that\\neven Top could not overtake them. Hunters and dog ran in vain; these\\nrodents escaped them easily. But the reporter resolved not to leave the\\nplace, until he had captured at least half-a-dozen of the quadrupeds.\\nHe wished to stock their larder first, and domesticate those which they\\nmight take later. It would not have been difficult to do this, with a\\nfew snares stretched at the openings of the burrows. But at this moment\\nthey had neither snares, nor anything to make them of. They must,\\ntherefore, be satisfied with visiting each hole, and rummaging in it\\nwith a stick, hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in\\nany other way.\\n\\nAt last, after half an hour, four rodents were taken in their holes.\\nThey were similar to their European brethren, and are commonly known by\\nthe name of American rabbits.\\n\\nThis produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and figured\\nat the evening repast. The tenants of the warren were not at all to be\\ndespised, for they were delicious. It was a valuable resource of the\\ncolony, and it appeared to be inexhaustible.\\n\\nOn the 31st of May the partitions were finished. The rooms had now only\\nto be furnished, and this would be work for the long winter days. A\\nchimney was established in the first room, which served as a kitchen.\\nThe pipe destined to conduct the smoke outside gave some trouble to\\nthese amateur bricklayers. It appeared simplest to Harding to make it of\\nbrick clay; as creating an outlet for it to the upper plateau was not to\\nbe thought of, a hole was pierced in the granite above the window of\\nthe kitchen, and the pipe met it like that of an iron stove. Perhaps\\nthe winds which blew directly against the facade would make the chimney\\nsmoke, but these winds were rare, and besides, Master Neb, the cook, was\\nnot so very particular about that.\\n\\nWhen these interior arrangements were finished, the engineer occupied\\nhimself in blocking up the outlet by the lake, so as to prevent any\\naccess by that way. Masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and\\nstrongly cemented together. Cyrus Harding did not yet realize his plan\\nof drowning this opening under the waters of the lake, by restoring\\nthem to their former level by means of a dam. He contented himself with\\nhiding the obstruction with grass and shrubs, which were planted in the\\ninterstices of the rocks, and which next spring would sprout thickly.\\nHowever, he used the waterfall so as to lead a small stream of fresh\\nwater to the new dwelling. A little trench, made below their level,\\nproduced this result; and this derivation from a pure and inexhaustible\\nsource yielded twenty-five or thirty gallons a day. There would never be\\nany want of water at Granite House. At last all was finished, and it was\\ntime, for the bad season was near. Thick shutters closed the windows of\\nthe facade, until the engineer had time to make glass.\\n\\nGideon Spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky projections\\naround the windows plants of different kinds, as well as long streaming\\ngrass, so that the openings were picturesquely framed in green, which\\nhad a pleasing effect.\\n\\nThe inhabitants of this solid, healthy, and secure dwelling, could not\\nbut be charmed with their work. The view from the windows extended over\\na boundless horizon, which was closed by the two Mandible Capes on the\\nnorth, and Claw Cape on the south. All Union Bay was spread before them.\\nYes, our brave settlers had reason to be satisfied, and Pencroft was\\nlavish in his praise of what he humorously called, “his apartments on\\nthe fifth floor above the ground!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\nThe winter season set in with the month of June, which corresponds with\\nthe month of December in the Northern Hemisphere. It began with showers\\nand squalls, which succeeded each other without intermission. The\\ntenants of Granite House could appreciate the advantages of a dwelling\\nwhich sheltered them from the inclement weather. The Chimneys would have\\nbeen quite insufficient to protect them against the rigor of winter, and\\nit was to be feared that the high tides would make another irruption.\\nCyrus Harding had taken precautions against this contingency, so as\\nto preserve as much as possible the forge and furnace which were\\nestablished there.\\n\\nDuring the whole of the month of June the time was employed in different\\noccupations, which excluded neither hunting nor fishing, the larder\\nbeing, therefore, abundantly supplied. Pencroft, so soon as he had\\nleisure, proposed to set some traps, from which he expected great\\nresults. He soon made some snares with creepers, by the aid of which the\\nwarren henceforth every day furnished its quota of rodents. Neb employed\\nnearly all his time in salting or smoking meat, which insured their\\nalways having plenty of provisions. The question of clothes was now\\nseriously discussed, the settlers having no other garments than those\\nthey wore when the balloon threw them on the island. These clothes were\\nwarm and good; they had taken great care of them as well as of their\\nlinen, and they were perfectly whole, but they would soon need to be\\nreplaced. Moreover, if the winter was severe, the settlers would suffer\\ngreatly from cold.\\n\\nOn this subject the ingenuity of Harding was at fault. They must provide\\nfor their most pressing wants, settle their dwelling, and lay in a\\nstore of food; thus the cold might come upon them before the question\\nof clothes had been settled. They must therefore make up their minds to\\npass this first winter without additional clothing. When the fine season\\ncame round again, they would regularly hunt those musmons which had been\\nseen on the expedition to Mount Franklin, and the wool once collected,\\nthe engineer would know how to make it into strong warm stuff.... How?\\nHe would consider.\\n\\n“Well, we are free to roast ourselves at Granite House!” said Pencroft.\\n“There are heaps of fuel, and no reason for sparing it.”\\n\\n“Besides,” added Gideon Spilett, “Lincoln Island is not situated under\\na very high latitude, and probably the winters here are not severe. Did\\nyou not say, Cyrus, that this thirty-fifth parallel corresponded to that\\nof Spain in the other hemisphere?”\\n\\n“Doubtless,” replied the engineer, “but some winters in Spain are very\\ncold! No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island is just as\\nrigorously tried. However, it is an island, and as such, I hope that\\nthe temperature will be more moderate.”\\n\\n“Why, captain?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“Because the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense reservoir, in\\nwhich is stored the heat of the summer. When winter comes, it restores\\nthis heat, which insures for the regions near the ocean a medium\\ntemperature, less high in summer, but less low in winter.”\\n\\n“We shall prove that,” replied Pencroft. “But I don’t want to bother\\nmyself about whether it will be cold or not. One thing is certain, that\\nis that the days are already short, and the evenings long. Suppose we\\ntalk about the question of light.”\\n\\n“Nothing is easier,” replied Harding.\\n\\n“To talk about?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“To settle.”\\n\\n“And when shall we begin?”\\n\\n“To-morrow, by having a seal hunt.”\\n\\n“To make candles?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\nSuch was the engineer’s project; and it was quite feasible, since he had\\nlime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the islet would furnish\\nthe fat necessary for the manufacture.\\n\\nThey were now at the 4th of June. It was Whit Sunday and they agreed to\\nobserve this feast. All work was suspended, and prayers were offered\\nto Heaven. But these prayers were now thanksgivings. The settlers in\\nLincoln Island were no longer the miserable castaways thrown on the\\nislet. They asked for nothing more--they gave thanks. The next day, the\\n5th of June, in rather uncertain weather, they set out for the islet.\\nThey had to profit by the low tide to cross the Channel, and it was\\nagreed that they would construct, for this purpose, as well as they\\ncould, a boat which would render communication so much easier, and\\nwould also permit them to ascend the Mercy, at the time of their grand\\nexploration of the southwest of the island, which was put off till the\\nfirst fine days.\\n\\nThe seals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their iron-tipped\\nspears, easily killed half-a-dozen. Neb and Pencroft skinned them, and\\nonly brought back to Granite House their fat and skin, this skin being\\nintended for the manufacture of boots.\\n\\nThe result of the hunt was this: nearly three hundred pounds of fat, all\\nto be employed in the fabrication of candles.\\n\\nThe operation was extremely simple, and if it did not yield absolutely\\nperfect results, they were at least very useful. Cyrus Harding would\\nonly have had at his disposal sulphuric acid, but by heating this acid\\nwith the neutral fatty bodies he could separate the glycerine; then from\\nthis new combination, he easily separated the olein, the margarin, and\\nthe stearin, by employing boiling water. But to simplify the operation,\\nhe preferred to saponify the fat by means of lime. By this he obtained a\\ncalcareous soap, easy to decompose by sulphuric acid, which precipitated\\nthe lime into the state of sulphate, and liberated the fatty acids.\\n\\nFrom these three acids-oleic, margaric, and stearic-the first, being\\nliquid, was driven out by a sufficient pressure. As to the two others,\\nthey formed the very substance of which the candles were to be molded.\\n\\nThis operation did not last more than four and twenty hours. The wicks,\\nafter several trials, were made of vegetable fibers, and dipped in the\\nliquefied substance, they formed regular stearic candles, molded by the\\nhand, which only wanted whiteness and polish. They would not doubtless\\nhave the advantages of the wicks which are impregnated with boracic\\nacid, and which vitrify as they burn and are entirely consumed, but\\nCyrus Harding having manufactured a beautiful pair of snuffers, these\\ncandles would be greatly appreciated during the long evenings in Granite\\nHouse.\\n\\nDuring this month there was no want of work in the interior of their new\\ndwelling. The joiners had plenty to do. They improved their tools, which\\nwere very rough, and added others also.\\n\\nScissors were made among other things, and the settlers were at last\\nable to cut their hair, and also to shave, or at least trim their\\nbeards. Herbert had none, Neb but little, but their companions were\\nbristling in a way which justified the making of the said scissors.\\n\\nThe manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble, but at last an\\ninstrument was obtained which, when vigorously handled, could divide the\\nligneous fibers of the wood. They then made tables, seats, cupboards,\\nto furnish the principal rooms, and bedsteads, of which all the bedding\\nconsisted of grass mattresses. The kitchen, with its shelves, on which\\nrested the cooking utensils, its brick stove, looked very well, and Neb\\nworked away there as earnestly as if he was in a chemist’s laboratory.\\n\\nBut the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters. In fact, the\\nwaterfall created by the explosion rendered the construction of two\\nbridges necessary, one on Prospect Heights, the other on the shore. Now\\nthe plateau and the shore were transversely divided by a watercourse,\\nwhich had to be crossed to reach the northern part of the island. To\\navoid it the colonists had been obliged to make a considerable detour,\\nby climbing up to the source of the Red Creek. The simplest thing was to\\nestablish on the plateau, and on the shore, two bridges from twenty to\\nfive and twenty feet in length. All the carpenter’s work that was needed\\nwas to clear some trees of their branches: this was a business of some\\ndays. Directly the bridges were established, Neb and Pencroft profited\\nby them to go to the oyster-bed which had been discovered near the\\ndowns. They dragged with them a sort of rough cart, which replaced the\\nformer inconvenient hurdle, and brought back some thousands of oysters,\\nwhich soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth of\\nthe Mercy. These molluscs were of excellent quality, and the colonists\\nconsumed some daily.\\n\\nIt has been seen that Lincoln Island, although its inhabitants had as\\nyet only explored a small portion of it, already contributed to almost\\nall their wants. It was probable that if they hunted into its most\\nsecret recesses, in all the wooded part between the Mercy and Reptile\\nPoint, they would find new treasures.\\n\\nThe settlers in Lincoln Island had still one privation. There was no\\nwant of meat, nor of vegetable products; those ligneous roots which\\nthey had found, when subjected to fermentation, gave them an acid drink,\\nwhich was preferable to cold water; they also made sugar, without canes\\nor beet-roots, by collecting the liquor which distils from the “acer\\nsaceharinum,” a sort of maple-tree, which flourishes in all the temperate\\nzones, and of which the island possessed a great number; they made\\na very agreeable tea by employing the herbs brought from the warren;\\nlastly, they had an abundance of salt, the only mineral which is used in\\nfood... but bread was wanting.\\n\\nPerhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some equivalent,\\nit was possible that they might find the sago or the breadfruit tree\\namong the forests of the south, but they had not as yet met with these\\nprecious trees. However, Providence came directly to their aid, in an\\ninfinitesimal proportion it is true, but Cyrus Harding, with all his\\nintelligence, all his ingenuity, would never have been able to produce\\nthat which, by the greatest chance, Herbert one day found in the lining\\nof his waistcoat, which he was occupied in setting to rights.\\n\\nOn this day, as it was raining in torrents, the settlers were assembled\\nin the great hall in Granite House, when the lad cried out all at\\nonce,--\\n\\n“Look here, captain--A grain of corn!”\\n\\nAnd he showed his companions a grain--a single grain--which from a hole\\nin his pocket had got into the lining of his waistcoat.\\n\\nThe presence of this grain was explained by the fact that Herbert, when\\nat Richmond, used to feed some pigeons, of which Pencroft had made him a\\npresent.\\n\\n“A grain of corn?” said the engineer quickly.\\n\\n“Yes, captain; but one, only one!”\\n\\n“Well, my boy,” said Pencroft, laughing, “we’re getting on capitally,\\nupon my word! What shall we make with one grain of corn?”\\n\\n“We will make bread of it,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Bread, cakes, tarts!” replied the sailor. “Come, the bread that this\\ngrain of corn will make won’t choke us very soon!”\\n\\nHerbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was going to\\nthrow away the grain in question; but Harding took it, examined it,\\nfound that it was in good condition, and looking the sailor full in the\\nface--“Pencroft,” he asked quietly, “do you know how many ears one grain\\nof corn can produce?”\\n\\n“One, I suppose!” replied the sailor, surprised at the question.\\n\\n“Ten, Pencroft! And do you know how many grains one ear bears?”\\n\\n“No, upon my word.”\\n\\n“About eighty!” said Cyrus Harding. “Then, if we plant this grain, at\\nthe first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which at the second\\nwill produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the third, five hundred\\nand twelve millions; at the fourth, more than four hundred thousands of\\nmillions! There is the proportion.”\\n\\nHarding’s companions listened without answering. These numbers\\nastonished them. They were exact, however.\\n\\n“Yes, my friends,” continued the engineer, “such are the arithmetical\\nprogressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this multiplication\\nof the grain of corn, of which the ear only bears eight hundred grains,\\ncompared to the poppy-plant, which bears thirty-two thousand seeds; to\\nthe tobacco-plant, which produces three hundred and sixty thousand? In\\na few years, without the numerous causes of destruction, which arrests\\ntheir fecundity, these plants would overrun the earth.”\\n\\nBut the engineer had not finished his lecture.\\n\\n“And now, Pencroft,” he continued, “do you know how many bushels four\\nhundred thousand millions of grains would make?”\\n\\n“No,” replied the sailor; “but what I do know is, that I am nothing\\nbetter than a fool!”\\n\\n“Well, they would make more than three millions, at a hundred and thirty\\nthousand a bushel, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“Three millions!” cried Pencroft.\\n\\n“Three millions.”\\n\\n“In four years?”\\n\\n“In four years,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and even in two years, if, as I\\nhope, in this latitude we can obtain two crops a year.”\\n\\nAt that, according to his usual custom, Pencroft could not reply\\notherwise than by a tremendous hurrah.\\n\\n“So, Herbert,” added the engineer, “you have made a discovery of great\\nimportance to us. Everything, my friends, everything can serve us in the\\ncondition in which we are. Do not forget that, I beg of you.”\\n\\n“No, captain, no, we shan’t forget it,” replied Pencroft; “and if ever\\nI find one of those tobacco-seeds, which multiply by three hundred and\\nsixty thousand, I assure you I won’t throw it away! And now, what must\\nwe do?”\\n\\n“We must plant this grain,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes,” added Gideon Spilett, “and with every possible care, for it bears\\nin itself our future harvests.”\\n\\n“Provided it grows!” cried the sailor.\\n\\n“It will grow,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nThis was the 20th of June. The time was then propitious for sowing this\\nsingle precious grain of corn. It was first proposed to plant it in\\na pot, but upon reflection it was decided to leave it to nature, and\\nconfide it to the earth. This was done that very day, and it is needless\\nto add, that every precaution was taken that the experiment might\\nsucceed.\\n\\nThe weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height above\\nGranite House. There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well sheltered\\nfrom the wind, and exposed to all the heat of the midday sun. The place\\nwas cleared, carefully weeded, and searched for insects and worms;\\nthen a bed of good earth, improved with a little lime, was made; it was\\nsurrounded by a railing; and the grain was buried in the damp earth.\\n\\nDid it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some\\nedifice? It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only\\nmatch, and all the anxiety of the operation. But this time the thing\\nwas more serious. In fact, the castaways would have been always able\\nto procure fire, in some mode or other, but no human power could supply\\nanother grain of corn, if unfortunately this should be lost!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\nFrom this time Pencroft did not let a single day pass without going to\\nvisit what he gravely called his “corn-field.” And woe to the insects\\nwhich dared to venture there! No mercy was shown them.\\n\\nTowards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the weather\\nbecame decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit thermometer\\nwould certainly have announced only twenty degrees above zero, that is\\nconsiderably below the freezing-point. The next day, the 30th of June,\\nthe day which corresponds to the 31st of December in the northern year,\\nwas a Friday. Neb remarked that the year finished on a bad day, but\\nPencroft replied that naturally the next would begin on a good one,\\nwhich was better.\\n\\nAt any rate it commenced by very severe cold. Ice accumulated at the\\nmouth of the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole expanse of the\\nlake was frozen.\\n\\nThe settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood.\\nPencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen, but had\\nbrought enormous rafts of wood to their destination. The current was\\nan indefatigable moving power, and it was employed in conveying the\\nfloating wood to the moment when the frost enchained it. To the fuel\\nwhich was so abundantly supplied by the forest, they added several\\ncartloads of coal, which had to be brought from the foot of the spurs of\\nMount Franklin. The powerful heat of the coal was greatly appreciated in\\nthe low temperature, which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of\\nFahrenheit, that is, thirteen degrees below zero. A second fireplace had\\nbeen established in the dining-room, where they all worked together at\\ntheir different avocations. During this period of cold, Cyrus Harding\\nhad great cause to congratulate himself on having brought to Granite\\nHouse the little stream of water from Lake Grant. Taken below the frozen\\nsurface, and conducted through the passage, it preserved its fluidity,\\nand arrived at an interior reservoir which had been hollowed out at the\\nback part of the storeroom, while the overflow ran through the well to\\nthe sea.\\n\\nAbout this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists, clothed\\nas warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the exploration of\\nthat part of the island between the Mercy and Claw Cape. It was a wide\\nextent of marshy land, and they would probably find good sport, for\\nwater-birds ought to swarm there.\\n\\nThey reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go there,\\nand as much to return, so that the whole of the day would be occupied.\\nAs an unknown part of the island was about to be explored, the whole\\ncolony took part in the expedition. Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at\\nsix o’clock in the morning, when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding,\\nGideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, armed with spears, snares,\\nbows and arrows, and provided with provisions, left Granite House,\\npreceded by Top, who bounded before them.\\n\\nTheir shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then covered\\nit.\\n\\n“But,” as the engineer justly observed, “that could not take the place\\nof a regular bridge!” So, the construction of a regular bridge was noted\\nin the list of future works.\\n\\nIt was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the right bank\\nof the Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those gigantic and superb\\nconiferae now sprinkled over with snow.\\n\\nBut they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole family of\\nquadrupeds, who had made a home there, disturbed by Top, rushed forth\\ninto the open country.\\n\\n“Ah! I should say those are foxes!” cried Herbert, when he saw the troop\\nrapidly decamping.\\n\\nThey were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of\\nbarking, at which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he stopped\\nshort in the chase, and gave the swift animals time to disappear.\\n\\nThe dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural History.\\nBut, by their barking, these foxes, with reddish-gray hair, black tails\\nterminating in a white tuft, had betrayed their origin. So Herbert\\nwas able, without hesitating, to give them their real name of “Arctic\\nfoxes.” They are frequently met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands,\\nand in all parts of America traversed by the thirtieth and fortieth\\nparallels. Herbert much regretted that Top had not been able to catch\\none of these carnivora.\\n\\n“Are they good to eat?” asked Pencroft, who only regarded the\\nrepresentatives of the fauna in the island from one special point of\\nview.\\n\\n“No,” replied Herbert; “but zoologists have not yet found out if the\\neye of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is correct to\\nclass them in the genus dog, properly so called.”\\n\\nHarding could not help smiling on hearing the lad’s reflection, which\\nshowed a thoughtful mind. As to the sailor, from the moment when he\\nfound that the foxes were not classed in the genus eatable, they were\\nnothing to him. However, when a poultry-yard was established at Granite\\nHouse, he observed that it would be best to take some precautions\\nagainst a probable visit from these four-legged plunderers, and no one\\ndisputed this.\\n\\nAfter having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach washed by\\nthe open sea. It was then eight o’clock in the morning. The sky was very\\nclear, as it often is after prolonged cold; but warmed by their walk,\\nneither Harding nor his companions felt the sharpness of the atmosphere\\ntoo severely. Besides there was no wind, which made it much more\\nbearable. A brilliant sun, but without any calorific action, was just\\nissuing from the ocean. The sea was as tranquil and blue as that of a\\nMediterranean gulf, when the sky is clear. Claw Cape, bent in the form\\nof a yataghan, tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast. To\\nthe left the edge of the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point.\\nCertainly, in this part of Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the\\nopen sea, not even a sandbank, ships beaten by the east winds would\\nhave found no shelter. They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea, in\\nwhich no shallows troubled the waters, by its uniform color, which was\\nstained by no yellow shades, by the absence of even a reef, that the\\ncoast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss. Behind in\\nthe west, but at a distance of four miles, rose the first trees of the\\nforests of the Far West. They might have believed themselves to be on\\nthe desolate coast of some island in the Antarctic regions which the ice\\nhad invaded. The colonists halted at this place for breakfast. A fire of\\nbrushwood and dried seaweed was lighted, and Neb prepared the breakfast\\nof cold meat, to which he added some cups of Oswego tea.\\n\\nWhile eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln Island was\\nvery sterile, and contrasted with all the western part. The reporter\\nwas thus led to observe that if chance had thrown them at first on the\\nshore, they would have had but a deplorable idea of their future domain.\\n\\n“I believe that we should not have been able to reach it,” replied the\\nengineer, “for the sea is deep, and there is not a rock on which we\\ncould have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at least, there were\\nsandbanks, an islet, which multiplied our chances of safety. Here,\\nnothing but the depths!”\\n\\n“It is singular enough,” remarked Spilett, “that this comparatively\\nsmall island should present such varied ground. This diversity of\\naspect, logically only belongs to continents of a certain extent. One\\nwould really say, that the western part of Lincoln Island, so rich and\\nso fertile, is washed by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that\\nits shores to the north and the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic\\nsea.”\\n\\n“You are right, my dear Spilett,” replied Cyrus Harding, “I have also\\nobserved this. I think the form and also the nature of this island\\nstrange. It is a summary of all the aspects which a continent presents,\\nand I should not be surprised if it was a continent formerly.”\\n\\n“What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?” cried Pencroft.\\n\\n“Why not?” replied Cyrus Harding. “Why should not Australia, New\\nIreland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific, have\\nonce formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe or Asia,\\nas Africa or the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite possible that all\\nthese islands, emerging from this vast ocean, are but the summits of\\na continent, now submerged, but which was above the waters at a\\nprehistoric period.”\\n\\n“As the Atlantis was formerly,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy... if, however, it existed.”\\n\\n“And would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?” asked\\nPencroft.\\n\\n“It is probable,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and that would sufficiently,\\nexplain the variety of productions which are seen on its surface.”\\n\\n“And the great number of animals which still inhabit it,” added Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer, “and you furnish me with an\\nargument to support my theory. It is certain, after what we have seen,\\nthat animals are numerous in this island, and what is more strange, that\\nthe species are extremely varied. There is a reason for that, and to\\nme it is that Lincoln Island may have formerly been a part of some vast\\ncontinent which had gradually sunk below the Pacific.”\\n\\n“Then, some fine day,” said Pencroft, who did not appear to be entirely\\nconvinced, “the rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its\\nturn, and there will be nothing between America and Asia.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Harding, “there will be new continents which millions and\\nmillions of animalculae are building at this moment.”\\n\\n“And what are these masons?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Coral insects,” replied Cyrus Harding. “By constant work they made the\\nisland of Clermont-Tonnerre, and numerous other coral islands in the\\nPacific Ocean. Forty-seven millions of these insects are needed to weigh\\na grain, and yet, with the sea-salt they absorb, the solid elements of\\nwater which they assimilate, these animalculae produce limestone, and\\nthis limestone forms enormous submarine erections, of which the hardness\\nand solidity equal granite. Formerly, at the first periods of creation,\\nnature employing fire, heaved up the land, but now she entrusts to these\\nmicroscopic creatures the task of replacing this agent, of which\\nthe dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently\\ndiminished--which is proved by the number of volcanoes on the surface of\\nthe earth, now actually extinct. And I believe that centuries succeeding\\nto centuries, and insects to insects, this Pacific may one day be\\nchanged into a vast continent, which new generations will inhabit and\\ncivilize in their turn.”\\n\\n“That will take a long time,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“Nature has time for it,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“But what would be the use of new continents?” asked Herbert. “It\\nappears to me that the present extent of habitable countries is\\nsufficient for humanity. Yet nature does nothing uselessly.”\\n\\n“Nothing uselessly, certainly,” replied the engineer, “but this is\\nhow the necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly on the\\ntropical zone occupied by the coral islands, may be explained. At least\\nto me this explanation appears plausible.”\\n\\n“We are listening, captain,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“This is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our globe\\nwill end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no longer be\\npossible, because of the intense cold to which it will be subjected.\\nWhat they are not agreed upon, is the cause of this cold. Some think\\nthat it will arise from the falling of the temperature, which the\\nsun will experience after millions of years; others, from the gradual\\nextinction of the fires in the interior of our globe, which have a\\ngreater influence on it than is generally supposed. I hold to this last\\nhypothesis, grounding it on the fact that the moon is really a cold\\nstar, which is no longer habitable, although the sun continues to throw\\non its surface the same amount of heat. If, then, the moon has become\\ncold, it is because the interior fires to which, as do all the stars of\\nthe stellar world, it owes its origin, are completely extinct. Lastly,\\nwhatever may be the cause, our globe will become cold some day, but this\\ncold will only operate gradually. What will happen, then? The temperate\\nzones, at a more or less distant period, will not be more habitable than\\nthe polar regions now are. Then the population of men, as well as the\\nanimals, will flow towards the latitudes which are more directly under\\nthe solar influence. An immense emigration will take place. Europe,\\nCentral Asia, North America, will gradually be abandoned, as well as\\nAustralasia and the lower parts of South America. The vegetation will\\nfollow the human emigration. The flora will retreat towards the Equator\\nat the same time as the fauna. The central parts of South America and\\nAfrica will be the continents chiefly inhabited. The Laplanders and the\\nSamoides will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the\\nMediterranean. Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions\\nwill not be too small, to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity? Now,\\nmay not provident nature, so as to give refuge to all the vegetable\\nand animal emigration, be at present laying the foundation of a new\\ncontinent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted these\\ninsects with the construction of it? I have often thought of all these\\nthings, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect of our\\nglobe will some day be completely changed; that by the raising of new\\ncontinents the sea will cover the old, and that, in future ages,\\na Columbus will go to discover the islands of Chimborazo, of the\\nHimalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America, Asia,\\nand Europe. Then these new continents will become, in their turn,\\nuninhabitable; heat will die away, as does the heat from a body when\\nthe soul has left it; and life will disappear from the globe, if not for\\never, at least for a period. Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest--will\\nbe left to death--to revive some day under superior conditions! But\\nall that, my friends, is the secret of the Author of all things; and\\nbeginning by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be\\ncarried too far, in investigating the secrets of the future.\\n\\n“My dear Cyrus,” replied Spilett, “these theories are prophecies to me,\\nand they will be accomplished some day.”\\n\\n“That is the secret of God,” said the engineer.\\n\\n“All that is well and good,” then said Pencroft, who had listened with\\nall his might, “but will you tell me, captain, if Lincoln Island has\\nbeen made by your insects?”\\n\\n“No,” replied Harding; “it is of a purely volcanic origin.”\\n\\n“Then it will disappear some day?”\\n\\n“That is probable.”\\n\\n“I hope we won’t be here then.”\\n\\n“No, don’t be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we have no\\nwish to die here, and hope to get away some time.”\\n\\n“In the meantime,” replied Gideon Spilett, “let us establish ourselves\\nhere as if forever. There is no use in doing things by halves.”\\n\\nThis ended the conversation. Breakfast was finished, the exploration was\\ncontinued, and the settlers arrived at the border of the marshy\\nregion. It was a marsh of which the extent, to the rounded coast which\\nterminated the island at the southeast, was about twenty square miles.\\nThe soil was formed of clayey flint-earth, mingled with vegetable\\nmatter, such as the remains of rushes, reeds, grass, etc. Here and there\\nbeds of grass, thick as a carpet, covered it. In many places icy pools\\nsparkled in the sun. Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden\\nswelling, could supply these ponds. They therefore naturally concluded\\nthat the marsh was fed by the infiltrations of the soil and it was\\nreally so. It was also to be feared that during the heat miasmas would\\narise, which might produce fevers.\\n\\nAbove the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water,\\nfluttered numbers of birds. Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in\\nflocks, and those fearless birds allowed themselves to be easily\\napproached.\\n\\nOne shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen of the\\nbirds, they were so close together. The explorers were, however, obliged\\nto content themselves with bows and arrows. The result was less, but the\\nsilent arrow had the advantage of not frightening the birds, while the\\nnoise of firearms would have dispersed them to all parts of the marsh.\\nThe hunters were satisfied, for this time, with a dozen ducks, which had\\nwhite bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black, white,\\nand red, and flattened beak. Herbert called them tadorns. Top helped in\\nthe capture of these birds, whose name was given to this marshy part of\\nthe island. The settlers had here an abundant reserve of aquatic game.\\nAt some future time they meant to explore it more carefully, and it was\\nprobable that some of the birds there might be domesticated, or at least\\nbrought to the shores of the lake, so that they would be more within\\ntheir reach.\\n\\nAbout five o’clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his companions\\nretraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing Tadorn’s Fens, and\\ncrossed the Mercy on the ice-bridge.\\n\\nAt eight in the evening they all entered Granite House.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\nThis intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without, however,\\npassing the degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned. When the atmosphere\\nwas calm, the low temperature was easily borne, but when the wind blew,\\nthe poor settlers, insufficiently clothed, felt it severely. Pencroft\\nregretted that Lincoln Island was not the home of a few families of\\nbears rather than of so many foxes and seals.\\n\\n“Bears,” said he, “are generally very well dressed, and I ask no more\\nthan to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have on their\\nbacks.”\\n\\n“But,” replied Neb, laughing, “perhaps the bears would not consent to\\ngive you their cloaks, Pencroft. These beasts are not St. Martins.”\\n\\n“We would make them do it, Neb, we would make them,” replied Pencroft,\\nin quite an authoritative tone.\\n\\nBut these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or at any\\nrate they had not yet shown themselves.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied\\nthemselves with making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border of\\nthe forest.\\n\\nAccording to the sailor, any animal, whatever it was, would be a lawful\\nprize, and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the new snares\\nwould be well received at Granite House.\\n\\nThe traps were besides extremely simple; being pits dug in the ground,\\na platform of branches and grass above, which concealed the opening, and\\nat the bottom some bait, the scent of which would attract animals. It\\nmust be mentioned also, that they had not been dug at random, but\\nat certain places where numerous footprints showed that quadrupeds\\nfrequented the ground. They were visited every day, and at three\\ndifferent times, during the first days, specimens of those Antarctic\\nfoxes which they had already seen on the right bank of the Mercy were\\nfound in them.\\n\\n“Why, there are nothing but foxes in this country!” cried Pencroft, when\\nfor the third time he drew one of the animals out of the pit. Looking at\\nit in great disgust, he added, “beasts which are good for nothing!”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Gideon Spilett, “they are good for something!”\\n\\n“And what is that?”\\n\\n“To make bait to attract other creatures!”\\n\\nThe reporter was right, and the traps were henceforward baited with the\\nfoxes carcasses.\\n\\nThe sailor had also made snares from the long tough fibers of a certain\\nplant, and they were even more successful than the traps. Rarely a day\\npassed without some rabbits from the warren being caught. It was always\\nrabbit, but Neb knew how to vary his sauces and the settlers did not\\nthink of complaining.\\n\\nHowever, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps supplied\\nthe hunters with other animals more useful than foxes, namely, several\\nof those small wild boars which had already been seen to the north of\\nthe lake. Pencroft had no need to ask if these beasts were eatable. He\\ncould see that by their resemblance to the pig of America and Europe.\\n\\n“But these are not pigs,” said Herbert to him, “I warn you of that,\\nPencroft.”\\n\\n“My boy,” replied the sailor, bending over the trap and drawing out one\\nof these representatives of the family of sus by the little appendage\\nwhich served it as a tail. “Let me believe that these are pigs.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because that pleases me!”\\n\\n“Are you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?”\\n\\n“I am very fond of pig,” replied the sailor, “particularly of its feet,\\nand if it had eight instead of four, I should like it twice as much!”\\n\\nAs to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to one of\\nthe four species which are included in the family, and they were also of\\nthe species of Tajacu, recognizable by their deep color and the absence\\nof those long teeth with which the mouths of their congeners are armed.\\nThese peccaries generally live in herds, and it was probable that they\\nabounded in the woody parts of the island.\\n\\nAt any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft did not\\nask more from them.\\n\\nTowards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was suddenly\\nmoderated by the wind shifting to the northwest. The temperature rose\\nsome degrees, and the accumulated vapor in the air was not long in\\nresolving into snow. All the island was covered with a sheet of white,\\nand showed itself to its inhabitants under a new aspect. The snow fell\\nabundantly for several days, and it soon reached a thickness of two\\nfeet.\\n\\nThe wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of Granite\\nHouse the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs. In some\\nplaces, the wind, eddying round the corners, formed the snow into tall\\nwhirling columns, resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their\\nbase, and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun. However, the\\nstorm, coming from the northwest, blew across the island, and the\\nposition of Granite House preserved it from a direct attack.\\n\\nBut in the midst of this snow-storm, as terrible as if it had been\\nproduced in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions\\ncould, notwithstanding their wish for it, venture forth, and they\\nremained shut up for five days, from the 20th to the 25th of August.\\nThey could hear the tempest raging in Jacamar Wood, which would surely\\nsuffer from it. Many of the trees would no doubt be torn up by the\\nroots, but Pencroft consoled himself by thinking that he would not have\\nthe trouble of cutting them down.\\n\\n“The wind is turning woodman, let it alone,” he repeated.\\n\\nBesides, there was no way of stopping it, if they had wished to do so.\\n\\nHow grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to Heaven for\\nhaving prepared for them this solid and immovable retreat! Cyrus Harding\\nhad also his legitimate share of thanks, but after all, it was Nature\\nwho had hollowed out this vast cavern, and he had only discovered it.\\nThere all were in safety, and the tempest could not reach them. If\\nthey had constructed a house of bricks and wood on Prospect Heights,\\nit certainly would not have resisted the fury of this storm. As to\\nthe Chimneys, it must have been absolutely uninhabitable, for the sea,\\npassing over the islet, would beat furiously against it. But here, in\\nGranite House, in the middle of a solid mass, over which neither the sea\\nnor air had any influence, there was nothing to fear.\\n\\nDuring these days of seclusion the settlers did not remain inactive.\\n\\nThere was no want of wood, cut up into planks, in the storeroom, and\\nlittle by little they completed their furnishing; constructing the\\nmost solid of tables and chairs, for material was not spared. Neb and\\nPencroft were very proud of this rather heavy furniture, which they\\nwould not have changed on any account.\\n\\nThen the carpenters became basket-makers, and they did not succeed badly\\nin this new manufacture. At the point of the lake which projected to the\\nnorth, they had discovered an osier-bed in which grew a large number\\nof purple osiers. Before the rainy season, Pencroft and Herbert had cut\\ndown these useful shrubs, and their branches, well prepared, could now\\nbe effectively employed. The first attempts were somewhat crude, but\\nin consequence of the cleverness and intelligence of the workmen,\\nby consulting, and recalling the models which they had seen, and by\\nemulating each other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased\\nby several baskets of different sizes. The storeroom was provided with\\nthem, and in special baskets Neb placed his collection of rhizomes,\\nstone-pine almonds, etc.\\n\\nDuring the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again.\\nThe temperature fell a little, and the tempest abated. The colonists\\nsallied out directly. There was certainly two feet of snow on the shore,\\nbut they were able to walk without much difficulty on the hardened\\nsurface. Cyrus Harding and his companions climbed Prospect Heights.\\n\\nWhat a change! The woods, which they had left green, especially in the\\npart at which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a uniform\\ncolor. All was white, from the summit of Mount Franklin to the shore,\\nthe forests, the plains, the lake, the river. The waters of the Mercy\\nflowed under a roof of ice, which, at each rising and ebbing of the\\ntide, broke up with loud crashes. Numerous birds fluttered over the\\nfrozen surface of the lake. Ducks and snipe, teal and guillemots were\\nassembled in thousands. The rocks among which the cascade flowed were\\nbristling with icicles. One might have said that the water escaped by a\\nmonstrous gargoyle, shaped with all the imagination of an artist of the\\nRenaissance. As to the damage caused by the storm in the forest, that\\ncould not as yet be ascertained; they would have to wait till the snowy\\ncovering was dissipated.\\n\\nGideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert did not miss this opportunity of\\ngoing to visit their traps. They did not find them easily, under the\\nsnow with which they were covered. They had also to be careful not to\\nfall into one or other of them, which would have been both dangerous and\\nhumiliating; to be taken in their own snares! But happily they avoided\\nthis unpleasantness, and found their traps perfectly intact. No animal\\nhad fallen into them, and yet the footprints in the neighborhood were\\nvery numerous, among others, certain very clear marks of claws. Herbert\\ndid not hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had\\npassed there, which justified the engineer’s opinion that dangerous\\nbeasts existed in Lincoln Island. These animals doubtless generally\\nlived in the forests of the Far West, but pressed by hunger, they had\\nventured as far as Prospect Heights. Perhaps they had smelled out the\\ninhabitants of Granite House. “Now, what are these feline creatures?”\\n asked Pencroft. “They are tigers,” replied Herbert. “I thought those\\nbeasts were only found in hot countries?”\\n\\n“On the new continent,” replied the lad, “they are found from Mexico to\\nthe Pampas of Buenos Aires. Now, as Lincoln Island is nearly under the\\nsame latitude as the provinces of La Plata, it is not surprising that\\ntigers are to be met with in it.”\\n\\n“Well, we must look out for them,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\nHowever, the snow soon disappeared, quickly dissolving under the\\ninfluence of the rising temperature. Rain fell, and the sheet of white\\nsoon vanished. Notwithstanding the bad weather, the settlers renewed\\ntheir stores of different things, stone-pine almonds, rhizomes, syrup\\nfrom the maple-tree, for the vegetable part; rabbits from the warren,\\nagouties, and kangaroos for the animal part. This necessitated several\\nexcursions into the forest, and they found that a great number of trees\\nhad been blown down by the last hurricane. Pencroft and Neb also pushed\\nwith the cart as far as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons\\nof fuel. They saw in passing that the pottery kiln had been severely\\ndamaged by the wind, at least six feet of it having been blown off.\\n\\nAt the same time as the coal, the store of wood was renewed at Granite\\nHouse, and they profited by the current of the Mercy having again become\\nfree, to float down several rafts. They could see that the cold period\\nwas not ended.\\n\\nA visit was also paid to the Chimneys, and the settlers could not but\\ncongratulate themselves on not having been living there during the\\nhurricane. The sea had left unquestionable traces of its ravages.\\nSweeping over the islet, it had furiously assailed the passages, half\\nfilling them with sand, while thick beds of seaweed covered the rocks.\\nWhile Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft hunted or collected wood, Cyrus Harding\\nand Gideon Spilett busied themselves in putting the Chimneys to rights,\\nand they found the forge and the bellows almost unhurt, protected as\\nthey had been from the first by the heaps of sand.\\n\\nThe store of fuel had not been made uselessly. The settlers had not done\\nwith the rigorous cold. It is known that, in the Northern Hemisphere,\\nthe month of February is principally distinguished by rapid fallings of\\nthe temperature. It is the same in the Southern Hemisphere, and the end\\nof the month of August, which is the February of North America, does not\\nescape this climatic law.\\n\\nAbout the 25th, after another change from snow to rain, the wind shifted\\nto the southeast, and the cold became, suddenly, very severe. According\\nto the engineer’s calculation, the mercurial column of a Fahrenheit\\nthermometer would not have marked less than eight degrees below zero,\\nand this intense cold, rendered still more painful by a sharp gale,\\nlasted for several days. The colonists were again shut up in Granite\\nHouse, and as it was necessary to hermetically seal all the openings\\nof the facade, only leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air, the\\nconsumption of candles was considerable. To economize them, the cavern\\nwas often only lighted by the blazing hearths, on which fuel was not\\nspared. Several times, one or other of the settlers descended to the\\nbeach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide, but\\nthey soon climbed up again to Granite House, and it was not without pain\\nand difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder.\\nIn consequence of the intense cold, their fingers felt as if burned when\\nthey touched the rounds. To occupy the leisure hours, which the tenants\\nof Granite House now had at their disposal, Cyrus Harding undertook an\\noperation which could be performed indoors.\\n\\nWe know that the settlers had no other sugar at their disposal than\\nthe liquid substance which they drew from the maple, by making deep\\nincisions in the tree. They contented themselves with collecting this\\nliquor in jars and employing it in this state for different culinary\\npurposes, and the more so, as on growing old, this liquid began to\\nbecome white and to be of a syrupy consistence.\\n\\nBut there was something better to be made of it, and one day Cyrus\\nHarding announced that they were going to turn into refiners.\\n\\n“Refiners!” replied Pencroft. “That is rather a warm trade, I think.”\\n\\n“Very warm,” answered the engineer.\\n\\n“Then it will be seasonable!” said the sailor.\\n\\nThis word refining need not awake in the mind thoughts of an elaborate\\nmanufactory with apparatus and numerous workmen. No! to crystallize this\\nliquor, only an extremely easy operation is required. Placed on the fire\\nin large earthen pots, it was simply subjected to evaporation, and\\nsoon a scum arose to its surface. As soon as this began to thicken,\\nNeb carefully removed it with a wooden spatula; this accelerated the\\nevaporation, and at the same time prevented it from contracting an\\nempyreumatic flavor.\\n\\nAfter boiling for several hours on a hot fire, which did as much good to\\nthe operators as the substance operated upon, the latter was transformed\\ninto a thick syrup. This syrup was poured into clay molds, previously\\nfabricated in the kitchen stove, and to which they had given various\\nshapes. The next day this syrup had become cold, and formed cakes\\nand tablets. This was sugar of rather a reddish color, but nearly\\ntransparent and of a delicious taste.\\n\\nThe cold continued to the middle of September, and the prisoners in\\nGranite House began to find their captivity rather tedious. Nearly every\\nday they attempted sorties which they could not prolong. They constantly\\nworked at the improvement of their dwelling. They talked while working.\\nHarding instructed his companions in many things, principally explaining\\nto them the practical applications of science. The colonists had no\\nlibrary at their disposal; but the engineer was a book which was always\\nat hand, always open at the page which one wanted, a book which answered\\nall their questions, and which they often consulted. The time thus\\npassed away pleasantly, these brave men not appearing to have any fears\\nfor the future.\\n\\nHowever, all were anxious to see, if not the fine season, at least the\\ncessation of the insupportable cold. If only they had been clothed in a\\nway to meet it, how many excursions they would have attempted, either to\\nthe downs or to Tadorn’s Fens! Game would have been easily approached,\\nand the chase would certainly have been most productive. But Cyrus\\nHarding considered it of importance that no one should injure his\\nhealth, for he had need of all his hands, and his advice was followed.\\n\\nBut it must be said, that the one who was most impatient of this\\nimprisonment, after Pencroft perhaps, was Top. The faithful dog found\\nGranite House very narrow. He ran backwards and forwards from one\\nroom to another, showing in his way how weary he was of being shut\\nup. Harding often remarked that when he approached the dark well which\\ncommunicated with the sea, and of which the orifice opened at the back\\nof the storeroom, Top uttered singular growlings. He ran round and round\\nthis hole, which had been covered with a wooden lid. Sometimes even he\\ntried to put his paws under the lid, as if he wished to raise it.\\nHe then yelped in a peculiar way, which showed at once anger and\\nuneasiness.\\n\\nThe engineer observed this maneuver several times.\\n\\nWhat could there be in this abyss to make such an impression on the\\nintelligent animal? The well led to the sea, that was certain. Could\\nnarrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?\\nDid some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom\\nof this well? The engineer did not know what to think, and could not\\nrefrain from dreaming of many strange improbabilities. Accustomed to go\\nfar into the regions of scientific reality, he would not allow\\nhimself to be drawn into the regions of the strange and almost of the\\nsupernatural; but yet how to explain why Top, one of those sensible dogs\\nwho never waste their time in barking at the moon, should persist in\\ntrying with scent and hearing to fathom this abyss, if there was nothing\\nthere to cause his uneasiness? Top’s conduct puzzled Cyrus Harding even\\nmore than he cared to acknowledge to himself.\\n\\nAt all events, the engineer only communicated his impressions to Gideon\\nSpilett, for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the\\nsuspicions which arose from what perhaps was only Top’s fancy.\\n\\nAt last the cold ceased. There had been rain, squalls mingled with snow,\\nhailstorms, gusts of wind, but these inclemencies did not last. The ice\\nmelted, the snow disappeared; the shore, the plateau, the banks of\\nthe Mercy, the forest, again became practicable. This return of spring\\ndelighted the tenants of Granite House, and they soon only passed in it\\nthe hours necessary for eating and sleeping.\\n\\nThey hunted much in the second part of September, which led Pencroft to\\nagain entreat for the firearms, which he asserted had been promised by\\nCyrus Harding. The latter, knowing well that without special tools it\\nwould be nearly impossible for him to manufacture a gun which would be\\nof any use, still drew back and put off the operation to some future\\ntime, observing in his usual dry way, that Herbert and Spilett had\\nbecome very skilful archers, so that many sorts of excellent animals,\\nagouties, kangaroos, capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, snipes,\\nin short, game both with fur and feathers, fell victims to their arrows,\\nand that, consequently, they could wait. But the obstinate sailor would\\nlisten to nothing of this, and he would give the engineer no peace till\\nhe promised to satisfy his desire. Gideon Spilett, however, supported\\nPencroft.\\n\\n“If, which may be doubted,” said he, “the island is inhabited by wild\\nbeasts, we must think how to fight with and exterminate them. A time may\\ncome when this will be our first duty.”\\n\\nBut at this period, it was not the question of firearms which occupied\\nHarding, but that of clothes. Those which the settlers wore had passed\\nthis winter, but they would not last until next winter. Skins of\\ncarnivora or the wool of ruminants must be procured at any price, and\\nsince there were plenty of musmons, it was agreed to consult on the\\nmeans of forming a flock which might be brought up for the use of the\\ncolony. An enclosure for the domestic animals, a poultry-yard for the\\nbirds, in a word to establish a sort of farm in the island, such were\\nthe two important projects for the fine season.\\n\\nIn consequence and in view of these future establishments, it became\\nof much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown\\nparts of Lincoln Island, that is to say, through that thick forest which\\nextended on the right bank of the Mercy, from its mouth to the extremity\\nof the Serpentine Peninsula, as well as on the whole of its western\\nside. But this needed settled weather, and a month must pass before this\\nexploration could be profitably undertaken.\\n\\nThey therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident occurred\\nwhich increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their\\ndomain.\\n\\nIt was the 24th of October. On this day, Pencroft had gone to visit his\\ntraps, which he always kept properly baited. In one of them he found\\nthree animals which would be very welcome for the larder. They were a\\nfemale peccary and her two young ones.\\n\\nPencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his capture,\\nand, as usual, he made a great show of his game.\\n\\n“Come, we shall have a grand feast, captain!” he exclaimed. “And you\\ntoo, Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!”\\n\\n“I shall be very happy,” replied the reporter; “but what is it that I am\\ngoing to eat?”\\n\\n“Suckling-pig.”\\n\\n“Oh, indeed, suckling-pig, Pencroft? To hear you, I thought that you\\nwere bringing back a young partridge stuffed with truffles!”\\n\\n“What?” cried Pencroft. “Do you mean to say that you turn up your nose\\nat suckling-pig?’\\n\\n“No,” replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm; “provided\\none doesn’t eat too much.”\\n\\n“That’s right, that’s right,” returned the sailor, who was not pleased\\nwhenever he heard his chase made light of. “You like to make objections.\\nSeven months ago, when we landed on the island, you would have been only\\ntoo glad to have met with such game!”\\n\\n“Well, well,” replied the reporter, “man is never perfect, nor\\ncontented.”\\n\\n“Now,” said Pencroft, “I hope that Neb will distinguish himself. Look\\nhere! These two little peccaries are not more than three months old!\\nThey will be as tender as quails! Come along, Neb, come! I will look\\nafter the cooking myself.”\\n\\nAnd the sailor, followed by Neb, entered the kitchen, where they were\\nsoon absorbed in their culinary labors.\\n\\nThey were allowed to do it in their own way. Neb, therefore, prepared\\na magnificent repast--the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, a smoked\\nham, stone-pine almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all the best that they\\nhad, but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory\\npeccaries.\\n\\nAt five o’clock dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House.\\nThe kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it excellent.\\n\\nTo the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on carving\\nhimself, and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the\\nguests.\\n\\nThese suckling-pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was devouring\\nhis share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an oath escaped\\nhim.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” asked Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“The matter? the matter is that I have just broken a tooth!” replied the\\nsailor.\\n\\n“What, are there pebbles in your peccaries?” said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“I suppose so,” replied Pencroft, drawing from his lips the object which\\nhad cost him a grinder--!\\n\\nIt was not a pebble--it was a leaden bullet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART 2\\n\\nABANDONED\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nIt was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been\\nthrown on Lincoln Island. During that time, notwithstanding the\\nresearches they had made, no human being had been discovered. No smoke\\neven had betrayed the presence of man on the surface of the island. No\\nvestiges of his handiwork showed that either at an early or at a late\\nperiod had man lived there. Not only did it now appear to be uninhabited\\nby any but themselves, but the colonists were compelled to believe that\\nit never had been inhabited. And now, all this scaffolding of reasonings\\nfell before a simple ball of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive\\nrodent! In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who\\nbut a human being could have used such a weapon?\\n\\nWhen Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions looked\\nat it with intense astonishment. All the consequences likely to result\\nfrom this incident, notwithstanding its apparent insignificance,\\nimmediately took possession of their minds. The sudden apparition of a\\nsupernatural being could not have startled them more completely.\\n\\nCyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the suggestions\\nwhich this fact, at once surprising and unexpected, could not fail to\\nraise in his mind. He took the bullet, turned it over and over, rolled\\nit between his finger and thumb; then, turning to Pencroft, he asked,--\\n\\n“Are you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than\\nthree months old?”\\n\\n“Not more, captain,” replied Pencroft. “It was still sucking its mother\\nwhen I found it in the trap.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the engineer, “that proves that within three months a\\ngun-shot was fired in Lincoln Island.”\\n\\n“And that a bullet,” added Gideon Spilett, “wounded, though not\\nmortally, this little animal.”\\n\\n“That is unquestionable,” said Cyrus Harding, “and these are the\\ndeductions which must be drawn from this incident: that the island was\\ninhabited before our arrival, or that men have landed here within three\\nmonths. Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by\\ndisembarking on the shore or by being wrecked? This point can only be\\ncleared up later. As to what they were, Europeans or Malays, enemies or\\nfriends of our race, we cannot possibly guess; and if they still inhabit\\nthe island, or if they have left it, we know not. But these questions\\nare of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled.”\\n\\n“No! a hundred times no! a thousand times no!” cried the sailor,\\nspringing up from the table. “There are no other men than ourselves on\\nLincoln Island! By my faith! The island isn’t large and if it had been\\ninhabited, we should have seen some of the inhabitants long before\\nthis!”\\n\\n“In fact, the contrary would be very astonishing,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“But it would be much more astonishing, I should think,” observed the\\nreporter, “if this peccary had been born with a bullet in its inside!”\\n\\n“At least,” said Neb seriously, “if Pencroft has not had--”\\n\\n“Look here, Neb,” burst out Pencroft. “Do you think I could have a\\nbullet in my jaw for five or six months without finding it out?\\nWhere could it be hidden?” he asked, opening his mouth to show the\\ntwo-and-thirty teeth with which it was furnished. “Look well, Neb, and\\nif you find one hollow tooth in this set, I will let you pull out half a\\ndozen!”\\n\\n“Neb’s supposition is certainly inadmissible,” replied Harding, who,\\nnotwithstanding the gravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile.\\n“It is certain that a gun has been fired in the island, within three\\nmonths at most. But I am inclined to think that the people who landed\\non this coast were only here a very short time ago, or that they just\\ntouched here; for if, when we surveyed the island from the summit of\\nMount Franklin, it had been inhabited, we should have seen them or we\\nshould have been seen ourselves. It is therefore, probable that within\\nonly a few weeks castaways have been thrown by a storm on some part of\\nthe coast. However that may be, it is of consequence to us to have this\\npoint settled.”\\n\\n“I think that we should act with caution,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Such is my advice,” replied Cyrus Harding, “for it is to be feared that\\nMalay pirates have landed on the island!”\\n\\n“Captain,” asked the sailor, “would it not be a good plan, before\\nsetting out, to build a canoe in which we could either ascend the\\nriver, or, if we liked, coast round the inland? It will not do to be\\nunprovided.”\\n\\n“Your idea is good, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “but we cannot wait\\nfor that. It would take at least a month to build a boat.”\\n\\n“Yes, a real boat,” replied the sailor; “but we do not want one for a\\nsea voyage, and in five days at the most, I will undertake to construct\\na canoe fit to navigate the Mercy.”\\n\\n“Five days,” cried Neb, “to build a boat?”\\n\\n“Yes, Neb; a boat in the Indian fashion.”\\n\\n“Of wood?” asked the Negro, looking still unconvinced.\\n\\n“Of wood,” replied Pencroft, “or rather of bark. I repeat, captain, that\\nin five days the work will be finished!”\\n\\n“In five days, then, be it,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“But till that time we must be very watchful,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Very watchful indeed, my friends,” replied Harding; “and I beg you to\\nconfine your hunting excursions to the neighborhood of Granite House.”\\n\\nThe dinner ended less gaily than Pencroft had hoped.\\n\\nSo, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than the\\nsettlers. Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it was\\nhereafter an unquestionable fact, and such a discovery could not but\\ncause great uneasiness among the colonists.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed long about\\nthe matter. They asked themselves if by chance this incident might not\\nhave some connection with the inexplicable way in which the engineer had\\nbeen saved, and the other peculiar circumstances which had struck them\\nat different times. However, Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the\\npros and cons of the question, ended by saying,--\\n\\n“In short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear Spilett?”\\n\\n“Yes, Cyrus.”\\n\\n“Well, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we\\nshall find nothing.”\\n\\nThe next day Pencroft set to work. He did not mean to build a boat with\\nboards and planking, but simply a flat-bottomed canoe, which would be\\nwell suited for navigating the Mercy--above all, for approaching its\\nsource, where the water would naturally be shallow. Pieces of bark,\\nfastened one to the other, would form a light boat; and in case of\\nnatural obstacles, which would render a portage necessary, it would be\\neasily carried. Pencroft intended to secure the pieces of bark by means\\nof nails, to insure the canoe being water-tight.\\n\\nIt was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a strong\\nand supple bark for the work. Now the last storm had brought down a\\nnumber of large birch-trees, the bark of which would be perfectly suited\\nfor their purpose. Some of these trees lay on the ground, and they had\\nonly to be barked, which was the most difficult thing of all, owing to\\nthe imperfect tools which the settlers possessed. However, they overcame\\nall difficulties.\\n\\nWhile the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied himself\\nwithout losing an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not idle.\\n\\nThey were made purveyors to the colony. The reporter could not but\\nadmire the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the bow and\\nspear. Herbert also showed great courage and much of that presence of\\nmind which may justly be called “the reasoning of bravery.” These two\\ncompanions of the chase, remembering Cyrus Harding’s recommendations,\\ndid not go beyond a radius of two miles round Granite House; but\\nthe borders of the forest furnished a sufficient tribute of agoutis,\\ncapybaras, kangaroos, peccaries, etc.; and if the result from the traps\\nwas less than during the cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed\\nquota, which might have fed all the colony in Lincoln Island.\\n\\nOften during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon Spilett on the\\nincident of the bullet, and the deductions which the engineer drew from\\nit, and one day--it was the 26th of October--he said--“But, Mr. Spilett,\\ndo you not think it very extraordinary that, if any castaways have\\nlanded on the island, they have not yet shown themselves near Granite\\nHouse?”\\n\\n“Very astonishing if they are still here,” replied the reporter, “but\\nnot astonishing at all if they are here no longer!”\\n\\n“So you think that these people have already quitted the island?”\\n returned Herbert.\\n\\n“It is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was prolonged, and\\nabove all, if they were still here, some accident would have at last\\nbetrayed their presence.”\\n\\n“But if they were able to go away,” observed the lad, “they could not\\nhave been castaways.”\\n\\n“No, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called provisional\\ncastaways. It is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the\\nisland without destroying their vessel, and that, the storm over, they\\nwent away again.”\\n\\n“I must acknowledge one thing,” said Herbert, “it is that Captain\\nHarding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of human beings\\non our island.”\\n\\n“In short,” responded the reporter, “there are only Malays who frequent\\nthese seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is best to avoid.”\\n\\n“It is not impossible, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert, “that some day or\\nother we may find traces of their landing.”\\n\\n“I do not say no, my boy. A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire, would\\nput us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our next\\nexpedition.”\\n\\nThe day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of the\\nforest near the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees. There, among\\nothers, rose, to a height of nearly 200 feet above the ground, some of\\nthose superb coniferae, to which, in New Zealand, the natives give the\\nname of Kauris.\\n\\n“I have an idea, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert. “If I were to climb to the\\ntop of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for an immense\\ndistance round.”\\n\\n“The idea is good,” replied the reporter; “but could you climb to the\\ntop of those giants?”\\n\\n“I can at least try,” replied Herbert.\\n\\nThe light and active boy then sprang on the first branches, the\\narrangement of which made the ascent of the kauri easy, and in a few\\nminutes he arrived at the summit, which emerged from the immense plain\\nof verdure.\\n\\nFrom this elevated situation his gaze extended over all the southern\\nportion of the island, from Claw Cape on the southeast, to Reptile End\\non the southwest. To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, which concealed\\na great part of the horizon.\\n\\nBut Herbert, from the height of his observatory, could examine all the\\nyet unknown portion of the island, which might have given shelter to the\\nstrangers whose presence they suspected.\\n\\nThe lad looked attentively. There was nothing in sight on the sea, not\\na sail, neither on the horizon nor near the island. However, as the bank\\nof trees hid the shore, it was possible that a vessel, especially if\\ndeprived of her masts, might lie close to the land and thus be invisible\\nto Herbert.\\n\\nNeither in the forests of the Far West was anything to be seen. The wood\\nformed an impenetrable screen, measuring several square miles, without a\\nbreak or an opening. It was impossible even to follow the course of the\\nMercy, or to ascertain in what part of the mountain it took its source.\\nPerhaps other creeks also ran towards the west, but they could not be\\nseen.\\n\\nBut at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped Herbert’s sight\\ncould he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the faintest trace of which\\nwould be easily discernible in the pure atmosphere?\\n\\nFor an instant Herbert thought he could perceive a slight smoke in the\\nwest, but a more attentive examination showed that he was mistaken. He\\nstrained his eyes in every direction, and his sight was excellent. No,\\ndecidedly there was nothing there.\\n\\nHerbert descended to the foot of the kauri, and the two sportsmen\\nreturned to Granite House. There Cyrus Harding listened to the lad’s\\naccount, shook his head and said nothing. It was very evident that\\nno decided opinion could be pronounced on this question until after a\\ncomplete exploration of the island.\\n\\nTwo days after--the 28th of October--another incident occurred, for\\nwhich an explanation was again required.\\n\\nWhile strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite House,\\nHerbert and Neb were fortunate enough to capture a magnificent specimen\\nof the order of chelonia. It was a turtle of the species Midas, the\\nedible green turtle, so called from the color both of its shell and fat.\\n\\nHerbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the rocks\\nto reach the sea.\\n\\n“Help, Neb, help!” he cried.\\n\\nNeb ran up.\\n\\n“What a fine animal!” said Neb; “but how are we to catch it?”\\n\\n“Nothing is easier, Neb,” replied Herbert. “We have only to turn the\\nturtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away. Take your spear and\\ndo as I do.”\\n\\nThe reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace and\\nplastron. They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was motionless as\\na rock.\\n\\nHerbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal, and by\\ntheir united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back.\\nThe turtle, which was three feet in length, would have weighed at least\\nfour hundred pounds.\\n\\n“Capital!” cried Neb; “this is something which will rejoice friend\\nPencroft’s heart.”\\n\\nIn fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be rejoiced,\\nfor the flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack-grass, is extremely\\nsavory. At this moment the creature’s head could be seen, which was\\nsmall, flat, but widened behind by the large temporal fossae hidden\\nunder the long roof.\\n\\n“And now, what shall we do with our prize?” said Neb. “We can’t drag it\\nto Granite House!”\\n\\n“Leave it here, since it cannot turn over,” replied Herbert, “and we\\nwill come back with the cart to fetch it.”\\n\\n“That is the best plan.”\\n\\nHowever, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which Neb\\ndeemed superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones; after\\nwhich the two hunters returned to Granite House, following the beach,\\nwhich the tide had left uncovered. Herbert, wishing to surprise\\nPencroft, said nothing about the “superb specimen of a chelonian” which\\nthey had turned over on the sand; but, two hours later, he and Neb\\nreturned with the cart to the place where they had left it. The “superb\\nspecimen of a chelonian” was no longer there!\\n\\nNeb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared about them.\\nIt was just at this spot that the turtle had been left. The lad even\\nfound the stones which he had used, and therefore he was certain of not\\nbeing mistaken.\\n\\n“Well!” said Neb, “these beasts can turn themselves over, then?’’\\n\\n“It appears so,” replied Herbert, who could not understand it at all,\\nand was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand.\\n\\n“Well, Pencroft will be disgusted!”\\n\\n“And Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this\\ndisappearance,” thought Herbert.\\n\\n“Look here,” said Neb, who wished to hide his ill-luck, “we won’t speak\\nabout it.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it,” replied Herbert.\\n\\nAnd the two, taking the cart, which there was now no use for, returned\\nto Granite House.\\n\\nArrived at the dockyard, where the engineer and the sailor were working\\ntogether, Herbert recounted what had happened.\\n\\n“Oh! the stupids!” cried the sailor, “to have let at least fifty meals\\nescape!”\\n\\n“But, Pencroft,” replied Neb, “it wasn’t our fault that the beast got\\naway; as I tell you, we had turned it over on its back!”\\n\\n“Then you didn’t turn it over enough!” returned the obstinate sailor.\\n\\n“Not enough!” cried Herbert.\\n\\nAnd he told how he had taken care to wedge up the turtle with stones.\\n\\n“It is a miracle, then!” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“I thought, captain,” said Herbert, “that turtles, once placed on their\\nbacks, could not regain their feet, especially when they are of a large\\nsize?’\\n\\n“That is true, my boy,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Then how did it manage?”\\n\\n“At what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle?” asked\\nthe engineer, who, having suspended his work, was reflecting on this\\nincident.\\n\\n“Fifteen feet at the most,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“And the tide was low at the time?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain.”\\n\\n“Well,” replied the engineer, “what the turtle could not do on the sand\\nit might have been able to do in the water. It turned over when the tide\\novertook it, and then quietly returned to the deep sea.”\\n\\n“Oh! what stupids we were!” cried Neb.\\n\\n“That is precisely what I had the honor of telling you before!” returned\\nthe sailor.\\n\\nCyrus Harding had given this explanation, which, no doubt, was\\nadmissible. But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this\\nexplanation? It cannot be said that he was.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\nOn the 9th of October the bark canoe was entirely finished. Pencroft\\nhad kept his promise, and a light boat, the shell of which was joined\\ntogether by the flexible twigs of the crejimba, had been constructed in\\nfive days. A seat in the stern, a second seat in the middle to preserve\\nthe equilibrium, a third seat in the bows, rowlocks for the two oars, a\\nscull to steer with, completed the little craft, which was twelve feet\\nlong, and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds. The operation of\\nlaunching it was extremely simple. The canoe was carried to the beach\\nand laid on the sand before Granite House, and the rising tide floated\\nit. Pencroft, who leaped in directly, maneuvered it with the scull and\\ndeclared it to be just the thing for the purpose to which they wished to\\nput it.\\n\\n“Hurrah!” cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate thus his\\nown triumph. “With this we could go round--”\\n\\n“The world?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“No, the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast and a sail, which the\\ncaptain will make for us some day, and we shall go splendidly! Well,\\ncaptain--and you, Mr. Spilett; and you, Herbert; and you, Neb--aren’t\\nyou coming to try our new vessel? Come along! we must see if it will\\ncarry all five of us!”\\n\\nThis was certainly a trial which ought to be made. Pencroft soon brought\\nthe canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks, and it was\\nagreed that they should make a trial of the boat that day by following\\nthe shore as far as the first point at which the rocks of the south\\nended.\\n\\nAs they embarked, Neb cried,--\\n\\n“But your boat leaks rather, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“That’s nothing, Neb,” replied the sailor; “the wood will get seasoned.\\nIn two days there won’t be a single leak, and our boat will have no more\\nwater in her than there is in the stomach of a drunkard. Jump in!”\\n\\nThey were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off. The weather was\\nmagnificent, the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within\\nthe narrow limits of a lake. Thus the boat could proceed with as much\\nsecurity as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the Mercy.\\n\\nNeb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft remained in\\nthe stern in order to use the scull.\\n\\nThe sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the southern\\npoint of the islet. A light breeze blew from the south. No roughness was\\nfound either in the channel or the green sea. A long swell, which the\\ncanoe scarcely felt, as it was heavily laden, rolled regularly over the\\nsurface of the water. They pulled out about half a mile distant from the\\nshore, that they might have a good view of Mount Franklin.\\n\\nPencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river. The boat\\nthen skirted the shore, which, extending to the extreme point, hid all\\nTadorn’s Fens.\\n\\nThis point, of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of\\nthe coast, was nearly three miles from the Mercy. The settlers resolved\\nto go to its extremity, and only go beyond it as much as was necessary\\nto take a rapid survey of the coast as far as Claw Cape.\\n\\nThe canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks\\nwhich fringed it, and which the rising tide began to cover. The cliff\\ngradually sloped away from the mouth of the river to the point. This was\\nformed of granite rocks, capriciously distributed, very different from\\nthe cliff at Prospect Heights, and of an extremely wild aspect. It might\\nhave been said that an immense cartload of rocks had been emptied out\\nthere. There was no vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected\\ntwo miles from the forest, and it thus represented a giant’s arm\\nstretched out from a leafy sleeve.\\n\\nThe canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without difficulty. Gideon\\nSpilett, pencil in one hand and notebook in the other, sketched the\\ncoast in bold strokes. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while\\nexamining this part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in\\nproportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible\\nCapes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely.\\n\\nAs to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by the\\nmistrust which his look expressed, it appeared that he was examining\\nsome strange country.\\n\\nIn the meantime, after a voyage of three-quarters of an hour, the\\ncanoe reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was preparing to\\nreturn, when Herbert, rising, pointed to a black object, saying,--\\n\\n“What do I see down there on the beach?”\\n\\nAll eyes turned towards the point indicated.\\n\\n“Why,” said the reporter, “there is something. It looks like part of a\\nwreck half buried in the sand.”\\n\\n“Ah!” cried Pencroft, “I see what it is!”\\n\\n“What?” asked Neb.\\n\\n“Barrels, barrels, which perhaps are full,” replied the sailor.\\n\\n“Pull to the shore, Pencroft!” said Cyrus.\\n\\nA few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek, and its\\npassengers leaped on shore.\\n\\nPencroft was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried in the\\nsand, but still firmly attached to a large chest, which, sustained by\\nthem, had floated to the moment when it stranded on the beach.\\n\\n“There has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island,” said\\nHerbert.\\n\\n“Evidently,” replied Spilett.\\n\\n“But what’s in this chest?” cried Pencroft, with very natural\\nimpatience. “What’s in this chest? It is shut up, and nothing to open it\\nwith! Well, perhaps a stone--”\\n\\nAnd the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one of the\\nsides of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand.\\n\\n“Pencroft,” said he, “can you restrain your impatience for one hour\\nonly?”\\n\\n“But, captain, just think! Perhaps there is everything we want in\\nthere!”\\n\\n“We shall find that out, Pencroft,” replied the engineer; “but trust\\nto me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us. We must\\nconvey it to Granite House, where we can open it easily, and without\\nbreaking it. It is quite prepared for a voyage; and since it has floated\\nhere, it may just as well float to the mouth of the river.”\\n\\n“You are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual,” replied the sailor.\\n\\nThe engineer’s advice was good. In fact, the canoe probably would not\\nhave been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest,\\nwhich doubtless was heavy, since two empty barrels were required to buoy\\nit up. It was, therefore, much better to tow it to the beach at Granite\\nHouse.\\n\\nAnd now, whence had this chest come? That was the important question.\\nCyrus Harding and his companions looked attentively around them, and\\nexamined the shore for several hundred steps. No other articles or\\npieces of wreck could be found. Herbert and Neb climbed a high rock\\nto survey the sea, but there was nothing in sight--neither a dismasted\\nvessel nor a ship under sail.\\n\\nHowever, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps this\\nincident was connected with that of the bullet? Perhaps strangers had\\nlanded on another part of the island? Perhaps they were still there?\\nBut the thought which came naturally to the settlers was, that these\\nstrangers could not be Malay pirates, for the chest was evidently of\\nAmerican or European make.\\n\\nAll the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually large\\nsize. It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered with\\na thick hide, which was secured by copper nails. The two great barrels,\\nhermetically sealed, but which sounded hollow and empty, were fastened\\nto its sides by strong ropes, knotted with a skill which Pencroft\\ndirectly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit. It appeared to be in a\\nperfect state of preservation, which was explained by the fact that it\\nhad stranded on a sandy beach, and not among rocks. They had no doubt\\nwhatever, on examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the\\nwater, and that its arrival on this coast was recent. The water did\\nnot appear to have penetrated to the inside, and the articles which it\\ncontained were no doubt uninjured.\\n\\nIt was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some\\ndismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the hope\\nthat it would reach the land, where they might afterwards find it,\\nthe passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means of this\\nfloating apparatus.\\n\\n“We will tow this chest to Granite House,” said the engineer, “where we\\ncan make an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the\\nsurvivors from the supposed wreck, we can return it to those to whom it\\nbelongs. If we find no one--”\\n\\n“We will keep it for ourselves!” cried Pencroft. “But what in the world\\ncan there be in it?”\\n\\nThe sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide would\\nevidently float it. One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was\\npartly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with\\nthe canoe. Pencroft and Neb then dug away the sand with their oars, so\\nas to facilitate the moving of the chest, towing which the boat soon\\nbegan to double the point, to which the name of Flotsam Point was given.\\n\\nThe chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to keep\\nit above water. The sailor also feared every instant that it would get\\nloose and sink to the bottom of the sea. But happily his fears were not\\nrealized, and an hour and a half after they set out--all that time had\\nbeen taken up in going a distance of three miles--the boat touched the\\nbeach below Granite House.\\n\\nCanoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the tide was\\nthen going out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb, hurrying home,\\nbrought back some tools with which to open the chest in such a way that\\nit might be injured as little as possible, and they proceeded to its\\ninventory. Pencroft did not try to hide that he was greatly excited.\\n\\nThe sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in good\\ncondition, would of course be of use. Then the locks were forced with a\\ncold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back. A second casing of zinc\\nlined the interior of the chest, which had been evidently arranged\\nthat the articles which it enclosed might under any circumstances be\\nsheltered from damp.\\n\\n“Oh!” cried Neb, “suppose it’s jam!\\n\\n“I hope not,” replied the reporter.\\n\\n“If only there was--” said the sailor in a low voice.\\n\\n“What?” asked Neb, who overheard him.\\n\\n“Nothing!”\\n\\nThe covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides of the\\nchest, and by degrees numerous articles of very varied character were\\nproduced and strewn about on the sand. At each new object Pencroft\\nuttered fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced up and\\ndown. There were books which made Herbert wild with joy, and cooking\\nutensils which Neb covered with kisses!\\n\\nIn short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied, for this\\nchest contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, books; and this\\nis the exact list of them as stated in Gideon Spilett’s note-book:\\n--Tools:--3 knives with several blades, 2 woodmen’s axes, 2 carpenter’s\\nhatchets, 3 planes, 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6 chisels, 2 files,\\n3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of\\ndifferent sizes, 2 boxes of needles.\\n\\nWeapons:--2 flint-lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2 breach-loader\\ncarbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels of powder, each\\ncontaining twenty-five pounds; 12 boxes of percussion caps.\\n\\nInstruments:--1 sextant, 1 double opera-glass, 1 telescope, 1 box of\\nmathematical instruments, 1 mariner’s compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer,\\n1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus,\\nobject-glass, plates, chemicals, etc.\\n\\nClothes:--2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but\\nevidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.\\n\\nUtensils:--1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal\\nplates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives.\\n\\nBooks:--1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different Polynesian\\nidioms, 1 dictionary of natural science, in six volumes; 3 reams of\\nwhite paper, 2 books with blank pages.\\n\\n“It must be allowed,” said the reporter, after the inventory had been\\nmade, “that the owner of this chest was a practical man! Tools, weapons,\\ninstruments, clothes, utensils, books--nothing is wanting! It might\\nreally be said that he expected to be wrecked, and had prepared for it\\nbeforehand.”\\n\\n“Nothing is wanting, indeed,” murmured Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.\\n\\n“And for a certainty,” added Herbert, “the vessel which carried this\\nchest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!”\\n\\n“Unless,” said Pencroft, “the owner had been taken prisoner by\\npirates--”\\n\\n“That is not admissible,” replied the reporter. “It is more probable\\nthat an American or European vessel has been driven into this quarter,\\nand that her passengers, wishing to save necessaries at least, prepared\\nthis chest and threw it overboard.”\\n\\n“Is that your opinion, captain?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” replied the engineer, “that may have been the case. It\\nis possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a wreck, they\\ncollected into this chest different articles of the greatest use in\\nhopes of finding it again on the coast--”\\n\\n“Even the photographic box!” exclaimed the sailor incredulously.\\n\\n“As to that apparatus,” replied Harding, “I do not quite see the use of\\nit; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant ammunition\\nwould have been more valuable to us as well as to any other castaways!”\\n\\n“But isn’t there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools, or\\nbooks, which would tell us something about them?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\nThat might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined,\\nespecially the books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons nor\\nthe instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of the\\nmaker; they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not appear to\\nhave been used. The same peculiarity marked the tools and utensils; all\\nwere new, which proved that the articles had not been taken by chance\\nand thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary, that the choice of\\nthings had been well considered and arranged with care. This was also\\nindicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from\\ndamp, and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste.\\n\\nAs to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms, both\\nwere English; but they neither bore the name of the publisher nor the\\ndate of publication.\\n\\nThe same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto, remarkable from a\\ntypographic point of view, and which appeared to have been often used.\\n\\nThe atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every country in\\nthe world, and several planispheres arranged upon Mercator’s projection,\\nand of which the nomenclature was in French--but which also bore neither\\ndate nor name of publisher.\\n\\nThere was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by which\\nthey could be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to show the\\nnationality of the vessel which must have recently passed these shores.\\n\\nBut, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure to the\\nsettlers on Lincoln Island. Till then, by making use of the productions\\nof nature, they had created everything for themselves, and, thanks to\\ntheir intelligence, they had managed without difficulty. But did it not\\nappear as if Providence had wished to reward them by sending them these\\nproductions of human industry? Their thanks rose unanimously to Heaven.\\n\\nHowever, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft. It\\nappeared that the chest did not contain something which he evidently\\nheld in great esteem, for in proportion as they approached the bottom\\nof the box, his hurrahs diminished in heartiness, and, the inventory\\nfinished, he was heard to mutter these words:--“That’s all very fine,\\nbut you can see that there is nothing for me in that box!”\\n\\nThis led Neb to say,--\\n\\n“Why, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?”\\n\\n“Half a pound of tobacco,” replied Pencroft seriously, “and nothing\\nwould have been wanting to complete my happiness!”\\n\\nNo one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor’s.\\n\\nBut the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was now more\\nthan ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly. It was therefore\\nagreed that the next morning at break of day, they should set out, by\\nascending the Mercy so as to reach the western shore. If any castaways\\nhad landed on the coast, it was to be feared they were without\\nresources, and it was therefore the more necessary to carry help to them\\nwithout delay.\\n\\nDuring the day the different articles were carried to Granite House,\\nwhere they were methodically arranged in the great hall. This day--the\\n29th of October--happened to be a Sunday, and, before going to bed,\\nHerbert asked the engineer if he would not read them something from the\\nGospel.\\n\\n“Willingly,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nHe took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when Pencroft\\nstopped him, saying,--“Captain, I am superstitious. Open at random\\nand read the first verse which, your eye falls upon. We will see if it\\napplies to our situation.”\\n\\nCyrus Harding smiled at the sailor’s idea, and, yielding to his wish, he\\nopened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker.\\n\\nImmediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with a\\npencil, was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh chapter of\\nthe Gospel of St. Matthew. He read the verse, which was this:--\\n\\n“For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\nThe next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the proposed\\nexploring expedition, which recent events had rendered so necessary. In\\nfact, things had so come about that the settlers in Lincoln Island no\\nlonger needed help for themselves, but were even able to carry it to\\nothers.\\n\\nIt was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far as\\nthe river was navigable. A great part of the distance would thus be\\ntraversed without fatigue, and the explorers could transport their\\nprovisions and arms to an advanced point in the west of the island.\\n\\nIt was necessary to think not only of the things which they should take\\nwith them, but also of those which they might have by chance to bring\\nback to Granite House. If there had been a wreck on the coast, as was\\nsupposed, there would be many things cast up, which would be lawfully\\ntheir prizes. In the event of this, the cart would have been of more use\\nthan the light canoe, but it was heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore\\nmore difficult to use; this led Pencroft to express his regret that the\\nchest had not contained, besides “his halfpound of tobacco,” a pair\\nof strong New Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the\\ncolony!\\n\\nThe provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a store\\nof meat and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough to sustain\\nthem for three days, the time which Harding assigned for the expedition.\\nThey hoped besides to supply themselves on the road, and Neb took care\\nnot to forget the portable stove.\\n\\nThe only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen’s axes, which\\nthey could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as also the\\ninstruments, the telescope and pocket-compass.\\n\\nFor weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were likely\\nto be more useful to them than the percussion fowling-pieces, the first\\nonly requiring flints which could be easily replaced, and the latter\\nneeding fulminating caps, a frequent use of which would soon exhaust\\ntheir limited stock. However, they took also one of the carbines and\\nsome cartridges. As to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds\\nin the barrel, a small supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer\\nhoped to manufacture an explosive substance which would allow them to\\nhusband it. To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well sheathed\\nin leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture into the vast\\nforest with some chance of success.\\n\\nIt is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus armed, were\\nat the summit of their happiness, although Cyrus Harding made them\\npromise not to fire a shot unless it was necessary.\\n\\nAt six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had\\nembarked, including Top, and they proceeded to the mouth of the Mercy.\\n\\nThe tide had begun to come up half an hour before. For several hours,\\ntherefore, there would be a current, which it was well to profit by, for\\nlater the ebb would make it difficult to ascend the river. The tide was\\nalready strong, for in three days the moon would be full, and it was\\nenough to keep the boat in the center of the current, where it floated\\nswiftly along between the high banks without its being necessary\\nto increase its speed by the aid of the oars. In a few minutes the\\nexplorers arrived at the angle formed by the Mercy and exactly at the\\nplace where, seven months before, Pencroft had made his first raft of\\nwood.\\n\\nAfter this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of\\ngreat evergreen firs.\\n\\nThe aspect of the banks was magnificent. Cyrus Harding and his\\ncompanions could not but admire the lovely effects so easily produced\\nby nature with water and trees. As they advanced the forest element\\ndiminished. On the right bank of the river grew magnificent specimens of\\nthe ulmaceae tribe, the precious elm, so valuable to builders, and which\\nwithstands well the action of water. Then there were numerous groups\\nbelonging to the same family, among others one in particular, the fruit\\nof which produces a very useful oil. Further on, Herbert remarked the\\nlardizabala, a twining shrub which, when bruised in water, furnishes\\nexcellent cordage; and two or three ebony trees of a beautiful black,\\ncrossed with capricious veins.\\n\\nFrom time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy, the\\ncanoe was stopped, when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft, their\\nguns in their hands, and preceded by Top, jumped on shore. Without\\nexpecting game, some useful plant might be met with, and the young\\nnaturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach,\\nbelonging to the order of chenopodiaceae, and numerous specimens of\\ncruciferae, belonging to the cabbage tribe, which it would certainly be\\npossible to cultivate by transplanting. There were cresses, horseradish,\\nturnips, and lastly, little branching hairy stalks, scarcely more than\\nthree feet high, which produced brownish grains.\\n\\n“Do you know what this plant is?” asked Herbert of the sailor.\\n\\n“Tobacco!” cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his favorite\\nplant except in the bowl of his pipe.\\n\\n“No, Pencroft,” replied Herbert; “this is not tobacco, it is mustard.”\\n\\n“Mustard be hanged!” returned the sailor; “but if by chance you happen\\nto come across a tobacco-plant, my boy, pray don’t scorn that!”\\n\\n“We shall find it some day!” said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Well!” exclaimed Pencroft, “when that day comes, I do not know what\\nmore will be wanting in our island!”\\n\\nThese different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were carried\\nto the canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in thought.\\n\\nThe reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently\\ndisembarked, sometimes on the right bank, sometimes on the left bank of\\nthe Mercy.\\n\\nThe latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The engineer\\nascertained by consulting his pocket-compass that the direction of the\\nriver from the first turn was obviously southwest and northeast, and\\nnearly straight for a length of about three miles. But it was to be\\nsupposed that this direction changed beyond that point, and that the\\nMercy continued to the north-west, towards the spurs of Mount Franklin,\\namong which the river rose.\\n\\nDuring one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get hold\\nof two couples of living gallinaceae. They were birds with long, thin\\nbeaks, lengthened necks, short wings, and without any appearance of\\na tail. Herbert rightly gave them the name of tinamous, and it\\nwas resolved that they should be the first tenants of their future\\npoultry-yard.\\n\\nBut till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report which awoke\\nthe echoes of the forest of the Far West was provoked by the appearance\\nof a beautiful bird, resembling the kingfisher.\\n\\n“I recognize him!” cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went off\\nby itself.\\n\\n“What do you recognize?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“The bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from which we\\ngave the name to that part of the forest.”\\n\\n“A jacamar!” cried Herbert.\\n\\nIt was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a metallic\\nluster. A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried it to the\\ncanoe. At the same time half a dozen lories were brought down. The lory\\nis of the size of a pigeon, the plumage dashed with green, part of\\nthe wings crimson, and its crest bordered with white. To the young boy\\nbelonged the honor of this shot, and he was proud enough of it. Lories\\nare better food than the jacamar, the flesh of which is rather tough,\\nbut it was difficult to persuade Pencroft that he had not killed the\\nking of eatable birds. It was ten o’clock in the morning when the canoe\\nreached a second angle of the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth.\\nHere a halt was made for breakfast under the shade of some splendid\\ntrees. The river still measured from sixty to seventy feet in breadth,\\nand its bed from five to six feet in depth. The engineer had observed\\nthat it was increased by numerous affluents, but they were unnavigable,\\nbeing simply little streams. As to the forest, including Jacamar Wood,\\nas well as the forests of the Far West, it extended as far as the eye\\ncould reach. In no place, either in the depths of the forests or under\\nthe trees on the banks of the Mercy, was the presence of man revealed.\\nThe explorers could not discover one suspicious trace. It was evident\\nthat the woodman’s axe had never touched these trees, that the pioneer’s\\nknife had never severed the creepers hanging from one trunk to another\\nin the midst of tangled brushwood and long grass. If castaways had\\nlanded on the island, they could not have yet quitted the shore, and it\\nwas not in the woods that the survivors of the supposed shipwreck should\\nbe sought.\\n\\nThe engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the western\\ncoast of Lincoln Island, which was at least five miles distant according\\nto his estimation.\\n\\nThe voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not towards\\nthe shore, but rather towards Mount Franklin, it was decided that they\\nshould use the boat as long as there was enough water under its keel\\nto float it. It was both fatigue spared and time gained, for they would\\nhave been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes.\\nBut soon the flow completely failed them, either the tide was going\\ndown, and it was about the hour, or it could no longer be felt at this\\ndistance from the mouth of the Mercy. They had therefore to make use of\\nthe oars. Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the scull.\\nThe forest soon became less dense, the trees grew further apart and\\noften quite isolated. But the further they were from each other the more\\nmagnificent they appeared, profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air\\nwhich circulated around them.\\n\\nWhat splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude! Certainly\\ntheir presence would have been enough for a botanist to name without\\nhesitation the parallel which traversed Lincoln Island.\\n\\n“Eucalypti!” cried Herbert.\\n\\nThey were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the\\nextratropical zone, the congeners of the Australian and New Zealand\\neucalyptus, both situated under the same latitude as Lincoln Island.\\nSome rose to a height of two hundred feet. Their trunks at the base\\nmeasured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark was covered by a\\nnetwork of farrows containing a red, sweet-smelling gum. Nothing is more\\nwonderful or more singular than those enormous specimens of the order of\\nthe myrtaceae, with their leaves placed vertically and not horizontally,\\nso that an edge and not a surface looks upwards, the effect being that\\nthe sun’s rays penetrate more freely among the trees.\\n\\nThe ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass, and\\nfrom the bushes escaped flights of little birds, which glittered in the\\nsunlight like winged rubies.\\n\\n“These are something like trees!” cried Neb; “but are they good for\\nanything?”\\n\\n“Pooh!” replied Pencroft. “Of course there are vegetable giants as well\\nas human giants, and they are no good, except to show themselves at\\nfairs!”\\n\\n“I think that you are mistaken, Pencroft,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and\\nthat the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously\\nemployed in cabinet-making.”\\n\\n“And I may add,” said Herbert, “that the eucalyptus belongs to a family\\nwhich comprises many useful members; the guava-tree, from whose fruit\\nguava jelly is made; the clove-tree, which produces the spice; the\\npomegranate-tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia Cauliflora,\\nthe fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle,\\nwhich contains an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle,\\nof which the bark forms an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from\\nwhence comes Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle, from whose buds and\\nberries spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields\\na sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is\\ntransformed into beer by fermentation; in short, all those trees known\\nunder the name of gum-trees or iron-bark trees in Australia, belong\\nto this family of the myrtaceae, which contains forty-six genera and\\nthirteen hundred species!”\\n\\nThe lad was allowed to run on, and he delivered his little botanical\\nlecture with great animation. Cyrus Harding listened smiling, and\\nPencroft with an indescribable feeling of pride.\\n\\n“Very good, Herbert,” replied Pencroft, “but I could swear that all\\nthose useful specimens you have just told us about are none of them\\ngiants like these!”\\n\\n“That is true, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“That supports what I said,” returned the sailor, “namely, that these\\ngiants are good for nothing!”\\n\\n“There you are wrong, Pencroft,” said the engineer; “these gigantic\\neucalypti, which shelter us, are good for something.”\\n\\n“And what is that?”\\n\\n“To render the countries which they inhabit healthy. Do you know what\\nthey are called in Australia and New Zealand?”\\n\\n“No, captain.”\\n\\n“They are called ‘fever trees.’”\\n\\n“Because they give fevers?”\\n\\n“No, because they prevent them!”\\n\\n“Good. I must note that,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Note it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the presence\\nof the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas. This natural antidote\\nhas been tried in certain countries in the middle of Europe and the\\nnorth of Africa where the soil was absolutely unhealthy, and the\\nsanitary condition of the inhabitants has been gradually ameliorated. No\\nmore intermittent fevers prevail in the regions now covered with forests\\nof the myrtaceae. This fact is now beyond doubt, and it is a happy\\ncircumstance for us settlers in Lincoln Island.”\\n\\n“Ah! what an island! What a blessed island!” cried Pencroft. “I tell\\nyou, it wants nothing--unless it is--”\\n\\n“That will come, Pencroft, that will be found,” replied the engineer;\\n“but now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river\\nwill carry our boat!”\\n\\nThe exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the\\nmidst of country covered with eucalypti, which predominated in the woods\\nof this portion of the island. The space which they occupied extended as\\nfar as the eye could reach on each side of the Mercy, which wound along\\nbetween high green banks. The bed was often obstructed by long weeds,\\nand even by pointed rocks, which rendered the navigation very difficult.\\nThe action of the oars was prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to push\\nwith a pole. They found also that the water was becoming shallower\\nand shallower, and that the canoe must soon stop. The sun was already\\nsinking towards the horizon, and the trees threw long shadows on the\\nground. Cyrus Harding, seeing that he could not hope to reach the\\nwestern coast of the island in one journey, resolved to camp at the\\nplace where any further navigation was prevented by want of water. He\\ncalculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast, and\\nthis distance was too great for them to attempt during the night in the\\nmidst of unknown woods.\\n\\nThe boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually became\\nthicker again, and appeared also to have more inhabitants; for if the\\neyes of the sailor did not deceive him, he thought he saw bands of\\nmonkeys springing among the trees. Sometimes even two or three of these\\nanimals stopped at a little distance from the canoe and gazed at the\\nsettlers without manifesting any terror, as if, seeing men for the first\\ntime, they had not yet learned to fear them. It would have been easy\\nto bring down one of these quadramani with a gunshot, and Pencroft was\\ngreatly tempted to fire, but Harding opposed so useless a massacre.\\nThis was prudent, for the monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very\\npowerful and extremely active, it was useless to provoke an unnecessary\\naggression, and the creatures might, ignorant of the power of the\\nexplorers’ firearms, have attacked them. It is true that the sailor\\nconsidered the monkeys from a purely alimentary point of view, for those\\nanimals which are herbivorous make very excellent game; but since they\\nhad an abundant supply of provisions, it was a pity to waste their\\nammunition.\\n\\nTowards four o’clock, the navigation of the Mercy became exceedingly\\ndifficult, for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks.\\nThe banks rose higher and higher, and already they were approaching the\\nspurs of Mount Franklin. The source could not be far off, since it was\\nfed by the water from the southern slopes of the mountain.\\n\\n“In a quarter of an hour,” said the sailor, “we shall be obliged to\\nstop, captain.”\\n\\n“Very well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our encampment for\\nthe night.”\\n\\n“At what distance are we from Granite House?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“About seven miles,” replied the engineer, “taking into calculation,\\nhowever, the detours of the river, which has carried us to the\\nnorthwest.”\\n\\n“Shall we go on?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“Yes, as long as we can,” replied Cyrus Harding. “To-morrow, at break of\\nday, we will leave the canoe, and in two hours I hope we shall cross the\\ndistance which separates us from the coast, and then we shall have the\\nwhole day in which to explore the shore.”\\n\\n“Go ahead!” replied Pencroft.\\n\\nBut soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which was\\nnow not more than twenty feet in breadth. The trees met like a bower\\noverhead, and caused a half-darkness. They also heard the noise of a\\nwaterfall, which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a\\nnatural barrier.\\n\\nPresently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared through\\nthe trees. The canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few minutes it\\nwas moored to a trunk near the right bank.\\n\\nIt was nearly five o’clock. The last rays of the sun gleamed through\\nthe thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall, making the spray\\nsparkle with all the colors of the rainbow. Beyond that, the Mercy was\\nlost in the bushwood, where it was fed from some hidden source. The\\ndifferent streams which flowed into it increased it to a regular river\\nfurther down, but here it was simply a shallow, limpid brook.\\n\\nIt was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming. The colonists\\ndisembarked, and a fire was soon lighted under a clump of trees, among\\nthe branches of which Cyrus Harding and his companions could, if it was\\nnecessary, take refuge for the night.\\n\\nSupper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there\\nwas only sleeping to think of. But, as roarings of rather a suspicious\\nnature had been heard during the evening, a good fire was made up for\\nthe night, so as to protect the sleepers with its crackling flames. Neb\\nand Pencroft also watched by turns, and did not spare fuel. They thought\\nthey saw the dark forms of some wild animals prowling round the camp\\namong the bushes, but the night passed without incident, and the next\\nday, the 31st of October, at five o’clock in the morning, all were on\\nfoot, ready for a start.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\nIt was six o’ clock in the morning when the settlers, after a hasty\\nbreakfast, set out to reach by the shortest way, the western coast of\\nthe island. And how long would it take to do this? Cyrus Harding\\nhad said two hours, but of course that depended on the nature of the\\nobstacles they might meet with. As it was probable that they would have\\nto cut a path through the grass, shrubs, and creepers, they marched axe\\nin hand, and with guns also ready, wisely taking warning from the cries\\nof the wild beasts heard in the night.\\n\\nThe exact position of the encampment could be determined by the bearing\\nof Mount Franklin, and as the volcano arose in the north at a distance\\nof less than three miles, they had only to go straight towards the\\nsouthwest to reach the western coast. They set out, having first\\ncarefully secured the canoe. Pencroft and Neb carried sufficient\\nprovision for the little band for at least two days. It would not thus\\nbe necessary to hunt. The engineer advised his companions to refrain\\nfrom firing, that their presence might not be betrayed to any one near\\nthe shore. The first hatchet blows were given among the brushwood in the\\nmidst of some mastic-trees, a little above the cascade; and his compass\\nin his hand, Cyrus Harding led the way.\\n\\nThe forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had\\nalready been met with near the lake and on Prospect Heights. There\\nwere deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, gum trees, eucalypti, hibiscus,\\ncedars, and other trees, generally of a moderate size, for their number\\nprevented their growth.\\n\\nSince their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes which\\nconstituted the mountain system of the island, on to a dry soil, but the\\nluxuriant vegetation of which indicated it to be watered either by some\\nsubterranean marsh or by some stream. However, Cyrus Harding did not\\nremember having seen, at the time of his excursion to the crater, any\\nother watercourses but the Red Creek and the Mercy.\\n\\nDuring the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous troops of\\nmonkeys who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of men, whose\\nappearance was so new to them. Gideon Spilett jokingly asked whether\\nthese active and merry quadrupeds did not consider him and his\\ncompanions as degenerate brothers.\\n\\nAnd certainly, pedestrians, hindered at each step by bushes, caught by\\ncreepers, barred by trunks of trees, did not shine beside those supple\\nanimals, who, bounding from branch to branch, were hindered by nothing\\non their course. The monkeys were numerous, but happily they did not\\nmanifest any hostile disposition.\\n\\nSeveral pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen, also two\\nor three koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a shot.\\n\\n“But,” said he, “you may jump and play just now; we shall have one or\\ntwo words to say to you on our way back!”\\n\\nAt half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown\\nstream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed\\nfoaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted its course. This creek\\nwas deep and clear, but it was absolutely unnavigable.\\n\\n“We are cut off!” cried Neb.\\n\\n“No,” replied Herbert, “it is only a stream, and we can easily swim\\nover.”\\n\\n“What would be the use of that?” returned Harding. “This creek evidently\\nruns to the sea. Let us remain on this side and follow the bank, and\\nI shall be much astonished if it does not lead us very quickly to the\\ncoast. Forward!”\\n\\n“One minute,” said the reporter. “The name of this creek, my friends? Do\\nnot let us leave our geography incomplete.”\\n\\n“All right!” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“Name it, my boy,” said the engineer, addressing the lad.\\n\\n“Will it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its mouth?”\\n answered Herbert.\\n\\n“Very well,” replied Cyrus Harding. “Let us follow it as fast as we can\\nwithout stopping.”\\n\\n“Still another minute!” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“Though hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,” said the\\nsailor.\\n\\n“We have no time to lose,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“Oh! five minutes!” replied Pencroft, “I only ask for five minutes to\\nuse in the interest of our breakfast!”\\n\\nAnd Pencroft, lying down on the bank, plunged his arm into the water,\\nand soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stones.\\n\\n“These will be good!” cried Neb, going to the sailor’s aid.\\n\\n“As I said, there is everything in this island, except tobacco!”\\n muttered Pencroft with a sigh.\\n\\nThe fishing did not take five minutes, for the crayfish were swarming in\\nthe creek. A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose shells were of a\\ncobalt blue. The settlers then pushed on.\\n\\nThey advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than\\nin the forest. From time to time they came upon the traces of animals of\\na large size who had come to quench their thirst at the stream, but none\\nwere actually seen, and it was evidently not in this part of the forest\\nthat the peccary had received the bullet which had cost Pencroft a\\ngrinder.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, considering the rapid current, Harding was led to\\nsuppose that he and his companions were much farther from the western\\ncoast than they had at first supposed. In fact, at this hour, the rising\\ntide would have turned back the current of the creek, if its mouth had\\nonly been a few miles distant. Now, this effect was not produced, and\\nthe water pursued its natural course. The engineer was much astonished\\nat this, and frequently consulted his compass, to assure himself that\\nsome turn of the river was not leading them again into the Far West.\\n\\nHowever, the creek gradually widened and its waters became less\\ntumultuous. The trees on the right bank were as close together as on the\\nleft bank, and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them;\\nbut these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited, for Top did not\\nbark, and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the\\npresence of any stranger in the neighborhood.\\n\\nAt half-past ten, to the great surprise of Cyrus Harding, Herbert, who\\nwas a little in front, suddenly stopped and exclaimed,--\\n\\n“The sea!”\\n\\nIn a few minutes more, the whole western shore of the island lay\\nextended before the eyes of the settlers.\\n\\nBut what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon which\\nchance had first thrown them. No granite cliff, no rocks, not even a\\nsandy beach. The forest reached the shore, and the tall trees bending\\nover the water were beaten by the waves. It was not such a shore as is\\nusually formed by nature, either by extending a vast carpet of sand,\\nor by grouping masses of rock, but a beautiful border consisting of the\\nmost splendid trees. The bank was raised a little above the level of the\\nsea, and on this luxuriant soil, supported by a granite base, the fine\\nforest trees seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the\\nisland.\\n\\nThe colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor,\\nwhich would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing-boats. It\\nserved as a neck to the new creek, of which the curious thing was that\\nits waters, instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope, fell from a\\nheight of more than forty feet, which explained why the rising tide was\\nnot felt up the stream. In fact, the tides of the Pacific, even at\\ntheir maximum elevation, could never reach the level of the river, and,\\ndoubtless, millions of years would pass before the water would have worn\\naway the granite and hollowed a practicable mouth.\\n\\nIt was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this\\nstream. Beyond, towards the north, the forest border was prolonged for\\na space of nearly two miles; then the trees became scarcer, and beyond\\nthat again the picturesque heights described a nearly straight line,\\nwhich ran north and south. On the contrary, all the part of the shore\\nbetween Falls River and Reptile End was a mass of wood, magnificent\\ntrees, some straight, others bent, so that the long sea-swell bathed\\ntheir roots. Now, it was this coast, that is, all the Serpentine\\nPeninsula, that was to be explored, for this part of the shore offered\\na refuge to castaways, which the other wild and barren side must have\\nrefused.\\n\\nThe weather was fine and clear, and from a height of a hillock on which\\nNeb and Pencroft had arranged breakfast, a wide view was obtained. There\\nwas, however, not a sail in sight; nothing could be seen along the shore\\nas far as the eye could reach. But the engineer would take nothing for\\ngranted until he had explored the coast to the very extremity of the\\nSerpentine Peninsula.\\n\\nBreakfast was soon despatched, and at half-past eleven the captain gave\\nthe signal for departure. Instead of proceeding over the summit of a\\ncliff or along a sandy beach, the settlers were obliged to remain under\\ncover of the trees so that they might continue on the shore.\\n\\nThe distance which separated Falls River from Reptile End was about\\ntwelve miles. It would have taken the settlers four hours to do this,\\non a clear ground and without hurrying themselves; but as it was they\\nneeded double the time, for what with trees to go round, bushes to cut\\ndown, and creepers to chop away, they were impeded at every step, these\\nobstacles greatly lengthening their journey.\\n\\nThere was, however, nothing to show that a shipwreck had taken place\\nrecently. It is true that, as Gideon Spilett observed, any remains of\\nit might have drifted out to sea, and they must not take it for granted\\nthat because they could find no traces of it, a ship had not been\\ncastaway on the coast.\\n\\nThe reporter’s argument was just, and besides, the incident of the\\nbullet proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln Island within\\nthree months.\\n\\nIt was already five o’clock, and there were still two miles between the\\nsettlers and the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula. It was evident\\nthat after having reached Reptile End, Harding and his companions would\\nnot have time to return before dark to their encampment near the source\\nof the Mercy. It would therefore be necessary to pass the night on the\\npromontory. But they had no lack of provisions, which was lucky, for\\nthere were no animals on the shore, though birds, on the contrary,\\nabound--jacamars, couroucous, tragopans, grouse, lories, parrots,\\ncockatoos, pheasants, pigeons, and a hundred others. There was not\\na tree without a nest, and not a nest which was not full of flapping\\nwings.\\n\\nTowards seven o’clock the weary explorers arrived at Reptile End. Here\\nthe seaside forest ended, and the shore resumed the customary appearance\\nof a coast, with rocks, reefs, and sands. It was possible that something\\nmight be found here, but darkness came on, and the further exploration\\nhad to be put off to the next day.\\n\\nPencroft and Herbert hastened on to find a suitable place for their\\ncamp. Among the last trees of the forest of the Far West, the boy found\\nseveral thick clumps of bamboos.\\n\\n“Good,” said he; “this is a valuable discovery.”\\n\\n“Valuable?” returned Pencroft.\\n\\n“Certainly,” replied Herbert. “I may say, Pencroft, that the bark of the\\nbamboo, cut into flexible laths, is used for making baskets; that this\\nbark, mashed into a paste, is used for the manufacture of Chinese paper;\\nthat the stalks furnish, according to their size, canes and pipes\\nand are used for conducting water; that large bamboos make excellent\\nmaterial for building, being light and strong, and being never attacked\\nby insects. I will add that by sawing the bamboo in two at the joint,\\nkeeping for the bottom the part of the transverse film which forms\\nthe joint, useful cups are obtained, which are much in use among the\\nChinese. No! you don’t care for that. But--”\\n\\n“But what?”\\n\\n“But I can tell you, if you are ignorant of it, that in India these\\nbamboos are eaten like asparagus.”\\n\\n“Asparagus thirty feet high!” exclaimed the sailor. “And are they good?”\\n\\n“Excellent,” replied Herbert. “Only it is not the stems of thirty feet\\nhigh which are eaten, but the young shoots.”\\n\\n“Perfect, my boy, perfect!” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“I will also add that the pith of the young stalks, preserved in\\nvinegar, makes a good pickle.”\\n\\n“Better and better, Herbert!”\\n\\n“And lastly, that the bamboos exude a sweet liquor which can be made\\ninto a very agreeable drink.”\\n\\n“Is that all?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“That is all!”\\n\\n“And they don’t happen to do for smoking?”\\n\\n“No, my poor Pencroft.”\\n\\nHerbert and the sailor had not to look long for a place in which to pass\\nthe night. The rocks, which must have been violently beaten by the\\nsea under the influence of the winds of the southwest, presented many\\ncavities in which shelter could be found against the night air. But just\\nas they were about to enter one of these caves a loud roaring arrested\\nthem.\\n\\n“Back!” cried Pencroft. “Our guns are only loaded with small shot, and\\nbeasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more for it than for\\ngrains of salt!” And the sailor, seizing Herbert by the arm, dragged\\nhim behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the\\nentrance of the cavern.\\n\\nIt was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic congeners, that\\nis to say, it measured five feet from the extremity of its head to the\\nbeginning of its tail. The yellow color of its hair was relieved by\\nstreaks and regular oblong spots of black, which contrasted with the\\nwhite of its chest. Herbert recognized it as the ferocious rival of\\nthe tiger, as formidable as the puma, which is the rival of the largest\\nwolf!\\n\\nThe jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his hair\\nbristling as if this was not the first time he had scented men.\\n\\nAt this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert, thinking\\nthat he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards him, when\\nGideon Spilett signed to him to remain where he was. This was not his\\nfirst tiger, and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained\\nmotionless, his gun to his shoulder, without moving a muscle. The jaguar\\ncollected itself for a spring, but at that moment a shot struck it in\\nthe eyes, and it fell dead.\\n\\nHerbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar. Neb and Harding also ran\\nup, and they remained for some instants contemplating the animal as it\\nlay stretched on the ground, thinking that its magnificent skin would be\\na great ornament to the hall at Granite House.\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!” cried Herbert, in a fit of\\nvery natural enthusiasm.\\n\\n“Well, my boy,” replied the reporter, “you could have done the same.”\\n\\n“I! with such coolness!--”\\n\\n“Imagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare, and you\\nwould fire as quietly as possible.”\\n\\n“That is,” rejoined Pencroft, “that it is not more dangerous than a\\nhare!”\\n\\n“And now,” said Gideon Spilett, “since the jaguar has left its abode, I\\ndo not see, my friends, why we should not take possession of it for the\\nnight.”\\n\\n“But others may come,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“It will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern,” said\\nthe reporter, “and no wild beasts will dare to cross the threshold.”\\n\\n“Into the jaguar’s house, then!” replied the sailor, dragging after him\\nthe body of the animal.\\n\\nWhile Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an abundant\\nsupply of dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up at the cave.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity, which he\\nmingled with the other fuel.\\n\\nThis done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was strewn with\\nbones, the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a sudden attack, they\\nhad supper, and then just before they lay down to rest, the heap of wood\\npiled at the entrance was set fire to. Immediately, a regular explosion,\\nor rather a series of reports, broke the silence! The noise was caused\\nby the bamboos, which, as the flames reached them, exploded like\\nfireworks. The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild\\nbeasts.\\n\\nIt was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud\\nexplosions, for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have employed it\\nfor many centuries to drive away from their encampments the formidable\\nwild beasts of Central Asia.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions slept like innocent marmots in the cave\\nwhich the jaguar had so politely left at their disposal.\\n\\nAt sunrise all were on the shore at the extremity of the promontory, and\\ntheir gaze was directed towards the horizon, of which two-thirds of\\nthe circumference were visible. For the last time the engineer could\\nascertain that not a sail nor the wreck of a ship was on the sea, and\\neven with the telescope nothing suspicious could be discovered.\\n\\nThere was nothing either on the shore, at least, in the straight line\\nof three miles which formed the south side of the promontory, for\\nbeyond that, rising ground had the rest of the coast, and even from the\\nextremity of the Serpentine Peninsula Claw Cape could not be seen.\\n\\nThe southern coast of the island still remained to be explored. Now\\nshould they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?\\n\\nThis was not included in their first plan. In fact, when the boat was\\nabandoned at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed that after\\nhaving surveyed the west coast, they should go back to it, and return to\\nGranite House by the Mercy. Harding then thought that the western coast\\nwould have offered refuge, either to a ship in distress, or to a vessel\\nin her regular course; but now, as he saw that this coast presented no\\ngood anchorage, he wished to seek on the south what they had not been\\nable to find on the west.\\n\\nGideon Spilett proposed to continue the exploration, that the question\\nof the supposed wreck might be completely settled, and he asked at what\\ndistance Claw Cape might be from the extremity of the peninsula.\\n\\n“About thirty miles,” replied the engineer, “if we take into\\nconsideration the curvings of the coast.”\\n\\n\\n“Thirty miles!” returned Spilett. “That would be a long day’s march.\\nNevertheless, I think that we should return to Granite House by the\\nsouth coast.”\\n\\n“But,” observed Herbert, “from Claw Cape to Granite House there must be\\nat least another ten miles.\\n\\n“Make it forty miles in all,” replied the engineer, “and do not hesitate\\nto do it. At least we should survey the unknown shore, and then we shall\\nnot have to begin the exploration again.”\\n\\n“Very good,” said Pencroft. “But the boat?”\\n\\n“The boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of the\\nMercy,” replied Gideon Spilett; “it may just as well stay there two\\ndays! As yet, we have had no reason to think that the island is infested\\nby thieves!”\\n\\n“Yet,” said the sailor, “when I remember the history of the turtle, I am\\nfar from confident of that.”\\n\\n“The turtle! the turtle!” replied the reporter. “Don’t you know that the\\nsea turned it over?”\\n\\n“Who knows?” murmured the engineer.\\n\\n“But,--” said Neb.\\n\\nNeb had evidently something to say, for he opened his mouth to speak and\\nyet said nothing.\\n\\n“What do you want to say, Neb?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“If we return by the shore to Claw Cape,” replied Neb, “after having\\ndoubled the Cape, we shall be stopped--”\\n\\n“By the Mercy! of course,” replied Herbert, “and we shall have neither\\nbridge nor boat by which to cross.”\\n\\n“But, captain,” added Pencroft, “with a few floating trunks we shall\\nhave no difficulty in crossing the river.”\\n\\n“Never mind,” said Spilett, “it will be useful to construct a bridge if\\nwe wish to have an easy access to the Far West!”\\n\\n“A bridge!” cried Pencroft. “Well, is not the captain the best engineer\\nin his profession? He will make us a bridge when we want one. As to\\ntransporting you this evening to the other side of the Mercy, and that\\nwithout wetting one thread of your clothes, I will take care of that. We\\nhave provisions for another day, and besides we can get plenty of game.\\nForward!”\\n\\nThe reporter’s proposal, so strongly seconded by the sailor, received\\ngeneral approbation, for each wished to have their doubts set at rest,\\nand by returning by Claw Cape the exploration would be ended. But there\\nwas not an hour to lose, for forty miles was a long march, and they\\ncould not hope to reach Granite House before night.\\n\\nAt six o’clock in the morning the little band set out. As a precaution\\nthe guns were loaded with ball, and Top, who led the van, received\\norders to beat about the edge of the forest.\\n\\nFrom the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the\\npeninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which\\nwas rapidly passed over, without even the most minute investigations\\nbringing to light the least trace of any old or recent landings; no\\ndebris, no mark of an encampment, no cinders of a fire, nor even a\\nfootprint!\\n\\nFrom the point of the peninsula on which the settlers now were their\\ngaze could extend along the southwest. Twenty-five miles off the coast\\nterminated in the Claw Cape, which loomed dimly through the morning\\nmists, and which, by the phenomenon of the mirage, appeared as if\\nsuspended between land and water.\\n\\nBetween the place occupied by the colonists and the other side of the\\nimmense bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of low land,\\nbordered in the background by trees; then the shore became more\\nirregular, projecting sharp points into the sea, and finally ended in\\nthe black rocks which, accumulated in picturesque disorder, formed Claw\\nCape.\\n\\nSuch was the development of this part of the island, which the settlers\\ntook in at a glance, while stopping for an instant.\\n\\n“If a vessel ran in here,” said Pencroft, “she would certainly be lost.\\nSandbanks and reefs everywhere! Bad quarters!”\\n\\n“But at least something would be left of the ship,” observed the\\nreporter.\\n\\n“There might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the sands,”\\n replied the sailor.\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for they\\nswallow up everything that is thrown on them. In a few days the hull of\\na ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely in there!”\\n\\n“So, Pencroft,” asked the engineer, “if a ship has been wrecked on\\nthese banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of her\\nremaining?”\\n\\n“No, captain, with the aid of time and tempest. However, it would be\\nsurprising, even in this case, that some of the masts or spars should\\nnot have been thrown on the beach, out of reach of the waves.”\\n\\n“Let us go on with our search, then,” returned Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nAt one o’clock the colonists arrived at the other side of Washington\\nBay, they having now gone a distance of twenty miles.\\n\\nThey then halted for breakfast.\\n\\nHere began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and\\nsandbanks. The long sea-swell could be seen breaking over the rocks in\\nthe bay, forming a foamy fringe. From this point to Claw Cape the beach\\nwas very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs.\\n\\nWalking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks which\\nencumbered the beach. The granite cliff also gradually increased in\\nheight, and only the green tops of the trees which crowned it could be\\nseen.\\n\\nAfter half an hour’s rest, the settlers resumed their journey, and not\\na spot among the rocks was left unexamined. Pencroft and Neb even rushed\\ninto the surf whenever any object attracted their attention. But they\\nfound nothing, some curious formations of the rocks having deceived\\nthem. They ascertained, however, that eatable shellfish abounded there,\\nbut these could not be of any great advantage to them until some easy\\nmeans of communication had been established between the two banks of the\\nMercy, and until the means of transport had been perfected.\\n\\nNothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be\\nfound on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such as the hull\\nof a ship, would have been seen directly, or any of her masts and spars\\nwould have been washed on shore, just as the chest had been, which was\\nfound twenty miles from here. But there was nothing.\\n\\nTowards three o’clock Harding and his companions arrived at a snug\\nlittle creek. It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from the sea,\\nand was entered by a narrow channel.\\n\\nAt the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the\\nrocky border, and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to an upper\\nplateau, which might be situated at least ten miles from Claw Cape, and\\nconsequently four miles in a straight line from Prospect Heights. Gideon\\nSpilett proposed to his companions that they should make a halt here.\\nThey agreed readily, for their walk had sharpened their appetites;\\nand although it was not their usual dinner-hour, no one refused to\\nstrengthen himself with a piece of venison. This luncheon would sustain\\nthem until their supper, which they intended to take at Granite House.\\nIn a few minutes the settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea-pines,\\nwere devouring the provisions which Neb produced from his bag.\\n\\nThis spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of the\\nsea. The view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended in Union\\nBay. Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible, and could not\\nbe from thence, for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed\\nthe northern horizon.\\n\\nIt is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea which\\nthe explorers could survey, and though the engineer swept the horizon\\nwith his glass, no vessel could be found.\\n\\nThe shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the\\nwater to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of\\nthe instrument.\\n\\n“Well,” said Gideon Spilett, “it seems we must make up our minds to\\nconsole ourselves with thinking that no one will come to dispute with us\\nthe possession of Lincoln Island!”\\n\\n“But the bullet,” cried Herbert. “That was not imaginary, I suppose!”\\n\\n“Hang it, no!” exclaimed Pencroft, thinking of his absent tooth.\\n\\n“Then what conclusion may be drawn?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“This,” replied the engineer, “that three months or more ago, a vessel,\\neither voluntarily or not, came here.”\\n\\n“What! then you admit, Cyrus, that she was swallowed up without leaving\\nany trace?” cried the reporter.\\n\\n“No, my dear Spilett; but you see that if it is certain that a human\\nbeing set foot on the island, it appears no less certain that he has now\\nleft it.”\\n\\n“Then, if I understand you right, captain,” said Herbert, “the vessel\\nhas left again?”\\n\\n“Evidently.”\\n\\n“And we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?” said Neb.\\n\\n“I fear so.”\\n\\n“Very well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it can’t be\\nhelped,” said Pencroft, who felt home-sickness for Granite House.\\n\\nBut just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and the dog\\nissued from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled with mud.\\n\\nNeb seized it. It was a piece of strong cloth!\\n\\nTop still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite his\\nmaster to follow him into the forest.\\n\\n“Now there’s something to explain the bullet!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\n“A castaway!” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“Wounded, perhaps!” said Neb.\\n\\n“Or dead!” added the reporter.\\n\\nAll ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the forest.\\nHarding and his companions made ready their firearms, in case of an\\nemergency.\\n\\nThey advanced some way into the wood, but to their great disappointment,\\nthey as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way.\\nShrubs and creepers were uninjured, and they had even to cut them away\\nwith the axe, as they had done in the deepest recesses of the forest.\\nIt was difficult to fancy that any human creature had ever passed there,\\nbut yet Top went backward and forward, not like a dog who searches at\\nrandom, but like a dog being endowed with a mind, who is following up an\\nidea.\\n\\nIn about seven or eight minutes Top stopped in a glade surrounded with\\ntall trees. The settlers gazed around them, but saw nothing, neither\\nunder the bushes nor among the trees.\\n\\n“What is the matter, Top?” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nTop barked louder, bounding about at the foot of a gigantic pine. All at\\nonce Pencroft shouted,--“Ho, splendid! capital!”\\n\\n“What is it?” asked Spilett.\\n\\n“We have been looking for a wreck at sea or on land!”\\n\\n“Well?”\\n\\n“Well; and here we’ve found one in the air!”\\n\\nAnd the sailor pointed to a great white rag, caught in the top of the\\npine, a fallen scrap of which the dog had brought to them.\\n\\n“But that is not a wreck!” cried Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon!” returned Pencroft.\\n\\n“Why? is it--?”\\n\\n“It is all that remains of our airy boat, of our balloon, which has been\\ncaught up aloft there, at the top of that tree!”\\n\\nPencroft was not mistaken, and he gave vent to his feelings in a\\ntremendous hurrah, adding,--\\n\\n“There is good cloth! There is what will furnish us with linen for\\nyears. There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts! Ha, ha, Mr.\\nSpilett, what do you say to an island where shirts grow on the trees?”\\n\\nIt was certainly a lucky circumstance for the settlers in Lincoln Island\\nthat the balloon, after having made its last bound into the air, had\\nfallen on the island and thus given them the opportunity of finding it\\nagain, whether they kept the case under its present form, or whether\\nthey wished to attempt another escape by it, or whether they usefully\\nemployed the several hundred yards of cotton, which was of fine quality.\\nPencroft’s joy was therefore shared by all.\\n\\nBut it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from\\nthe tree, to place it in security, and this was no slight task. Neb,\\nHerbert, and the sailor, climbing to the summit of the tree, used all\\ntheir skill to disengage the now reduced balloon.\\n\\nThe operation lasted two hours, and then not only the case, with its\\nvalve, its springs, its brasswork, lay on the ground, but the net, that\\nis to say a considerable quantity of ropes and cordage, and the\\ncircle and the anchor. The case, except for the fracture, was in good\\ncondition, only the lower portion being torn.\\n\\nIt was a fortune which had fallen from the sky.\\n\\n“All the same, captain,” said the sailor, “if we ever decide to leave\\nthe island, it won’t be in a balloon, will it? These airboats won’t go\\nwhere we want them to go, and we have had some experience in that way!\\nLook here, we will build a craft of some twenty tons, and then we can\\nmake a main-sail, a foresail, and a jib out of that cloth. As to the\\nrest of it, that will help to dress us.”\\n\\n“We shall see, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding; “we shall see.”\\n\\n“In the meantime, we must put it in a safe place,” said Neb.\\n\\nThey certainly could not think of carrying this load of cloth,\\nropes, and cordage, to Granite House, for the weight of it was very\\nconsiderable, and while waiting for a suitable vehicle in which to\\nconvey it, it was of importance that this treasure should not be left\\nlonger exposed to the mercies of the first storm. The settlers, uniting\\ntheir efforts, managed to drag it as far as the shore, where they\\ndiscovered a large rocky cavity, which owing to its position could not\\nbe visited either by the wind or rain.\\n\\n“We needed a locker, and now we have one,” said Pencroft; “but as we\\ncannot lock it up, it will be prudent to hide the opening. I don’t mean\\nfrom two-legged thieves, but from those with four paws!”\\n\\nAt six o’clock, all was stowed away, and after having given the creek\\nthe very suitable name of “Port Balloon,” the settlers pursued their\\nway along Claw Cape. Pencroft and the engineer talked of the different\\nprojects which it was agreed to put into execution with the briefest\\npossible delay. It was necessary first of all to throw a bridge over the\\nMercy, so as to establish an easy communication with the south of the\\nisland; then the cart must be taken to bring back the balloon, for the\\ncanoe alone could not carry it, then they would build a decked boat, and\\nPencroft would rig it as a cutter, and they would be able to undertake\\nvoyages of circumnavigation round the island, etc.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile night came on, and it was already dark when the\\nsettlers reached Flotsam Point, where they had found the precious chest.\\n\\nThe distance between Flotsam Point and Granite House was another four\\nmiles, and it was midnight when, after having followed the shore to the\\nmouth of the Mercy, the settlers arrived at the first angle formed by\\nthe Mercy.\\n\\nThere the river was eighty feet in breadth, which was awkward to cross,\\nbut as Pencroft had taken upon himself to conquer this difficulty, he\\nwas compelled to do it. The settlers certainly had reason to be pretty\\ntired. The journey had been long, and the task of getting down the\\nballoon had not rested either their arms or legs. They were anxious\\nto reach Granite House to eat and sleep, and if the bridge had been\\nconstructed, in a quarter of an hour they would have been at home.\\n\\nThe night was very dark. Pencroft prepared to keep his promise by\\nconstructing a sort of raft, on which to make the passage of the Mercy.\\nHe and Neb, armed with axes, chose two trees near the water, and began\\nto attack them at the base.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Spilett, seated on the bank, waited till their\\ncompanions were ready for their help, while Herbert roamed about, though\\nwithout going to any distance. All at once, the lad, who had strolled by\\nthe river, came running back, and, pointing up the Mercy, exclaimed,--\\n\\n“What is floating there?”\\n\\nPencroft stopped working, and seeing an indistinct object moving through\\nthe gloom,--\\n\\n“A canoe!” cried he.\\n\\nAll approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat floating down\\nthe current.\\n\\n“Boat ahoy!” shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps it would\\nbe best to keep silence.\\n\\nNo reply. The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more than twelve\\nfeet off, when the sailor exclaimed,--\\n\\n“But it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and floated down\\nthe current. I must say she has arrived very opportunely.”\\n\\n“Our boat?” murmured the engineer.\\n\\nPencroft was right. It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope had\\nundoubtedly broken, and which had come alone from the sources of the\\nMercy. It was very important to seize it before the rapid current should\\nhave swept it away out of the mouth of the river, but Neb and Pencroft\\ncleverly managed this by means of a long pole.\\n\\nThe canoe touched the shore. The engineer leaped in first, and found,\\non examining the rope, that it had been really worn through by rubbing\\nagainst the rocks.\\n\\n“Well,” said the reporter to him, in a low voice, “this is a strange\\nthing.”\\n\\n“Strange indeed!” returned Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nStrange or not, it was very fortunate. Herbert, the reporter, Neb, and\\nPencroft, embarked in turn. There was no doubt about the rope having\\nbeen worn through, but the astonishing part of the affair was, that the\\nboat should arrive just at the moment when the settlers were there to\\nseize it on its way, for a quarter of an hour earlier or later it would\\nhave been lost in the sea.\\n\\nIf they had been living in the time of genii, this incident would\\nhave given them the right to think that the island was haunted by some\\nsupernatural being, who used his power in the service of the castaways!\\n\\nA few strokes of the oar brought the settlers to the mouth of the\\nMercy. The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the Chimneys, and all\\nproceeded towards the ladder of Granite House.\\n\\nBut at that moment, Top barked angrily, and Neb, who was looking for the\\nfirst steps, uttered a cry.\\n\\nThere was no longer a ladder!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\nCyrus Harding stood still, without saying a word. His companions\\nsearched in the darkness on the wall, in case the wind should have\\nmoved the ladder, and on the ground, thinking that it might have fallen\\ndown.... But the ladder had quite disappeared. As to ascertaining if\\na squall had blown it on the landing-place, half way up, that was\\nimpossible in the dark.\\n\\n“If it is a joke,” cried Pencroft, “it is a very stupid one! To come\\nhome and find no staircase to go up to your room by--that’s nothing for\\nweary men to laugh at.”\\n\\nNeb could do nothing but cry out “Oh! oh! oh!”\\n\\n“I begin to think that very curious things happen in Lincoln Island!”\\n said Pencroft.\\n\\n“Curious?” replied Gideon Spilett, “not at all, Pencroft, nothing can be\\nmore natural. Some one has come during our absence, taken possession of\\nour dwelling and drawn up the ladder.”\\n\\n“Some one,” cried the sailor. “But who?”\\n\\n“Who but the hunter who fired the bullet?” replied the reporter.\\n\\n“Well, if there is any one up there,” replied Pencroft, who began to\\nlose patience, “I will give them a hail, and they must answer.”\\n\\nAnd in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged “Halloo!” which\\nwas echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks.\\n\\nThe settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling\\nlaugh, of which they could not guess the origin. But no voice replied to\\nPencroft, who in vain repeated his vigorous shouts.\\n\\nThere was something indeed in this to astonish the most apathetic\\nof men, and the settlers were not men of that description. In their\\nsituation every incident had its importance, and, certainly, during the\\nseven months which they had spent on the island, they had not before met\\nwith anything of so surprising a character.\\n\\nBe that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity of the\\nevent, they remained below Granite House, not knowing what to think,\\nnot knowing what to do, questioning each other without any hope of\\na satisfactory reply, every one starting some supposition each more\\nunlikely than the last. Neb bewailed himself, much disappointed at not\\nbeing able to get into his kitchen, for the provisions which they\\nhad had on their expedition were exhausted, and they had no means of\\nrenewing them.\\n\\n“My friends,” at last said Cyrus Harding, “there is only one thing to be\\ndone at present; wait for day, and then act according to circumstances.\\nBut let us go to the Chimneys. There we shall be under shelter, and if\\nwe cannot eat, we can at least sleep.”\\n\\n“But who is it that has played us this cool trick?” again asked\\nPencroft, unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot.\\n\\nWhoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer\\nproposed, to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day. In the meanwhile\\nTop was ordered to mount guard below the windows of Granite House, and\\nwhen Top received an order he obeyed it without any questioning. The\\nbrave dog therefore remained at the foot of the cliff while his master\\nwith his companions sought a refuge among the rocks.\\n\\nTo say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept well on\\nthe sandy floor of the Chimneys would not be true. It was not only that\\nthey were extremely anxious to find out the cause of what had happened,\\nwhether it was the result of an accident which would be discovered at\\nthe return of day, or whether on the contrary it was the work of a human\\nbeing; but they also had very uncomfortable beds. That could not be\\nhelped, however, for in some way or other at that moment their dwelling\\nwas occupied, and they could not possibly enter it.\\n\\nNow Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their warehouse.\\nThere were all the stores belonging to the colony, weapons, instruments,\\ntools, ammunition, provisions, etc. To think that all that might be\\npillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over\\nagain, fresh weapons and tools to make, was a serious matter. Their\\nuneasiness led one or other of them also to go out every few minutes to\\nsee if Top was keeping good watch. Cyrus Harding alone waited with his\\nhabitual patience, although his strong mind was exasperated at being\\nconfronted with such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at\\nhimself for allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name, to\\ngain an influence over him. Gideon Spilett shared his feelings in this\\nrespect, and the two conversed together in whispers of the inexplicable\\ncircumstance which baffled even their intelligence and experience.\\n\\n“It is a joke,” said Pencroft; “it is a trick some one has played us.\\nWell, I don’t like such jokes, and the joker had better look out for\\nhimself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell him.”\\n\\nAs soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the colonists,\\nsuitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite House. The rising\\nsun now shone on the cliff and they could see the windows, the shutters\\nof which were closed, through the curtains of foliage.\\n\\nAll here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw\\nthat the door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide\\nopen.\\n\\nSome one had entered Granite House--there could be no more doubt about\\nthat.\\n\\nThe upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the landing,\\nwas in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to\\nthe threshold. It was evident that the intruders had wished to guard\\nthemselves against a surprise.\\n\\nPencroft hailed again.\\n\\nNo reply.\\n\\n“The beggars,” exclaimed the sailor. “There they are sleeping quietly\\nas if they were in their own house. Hallo there, you pirates, brigands,\\nrobbers, sons of John Bull!”\\n\\nWhen Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of “son of\\nJohn Bull,” he considered he had reached the last limits of insult.\\n\\nThe sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of Granite House\\nbecame illuminated by its rays; but in the interior as well as on the\\nexterior all was quiet and calm.\\n\\nThe settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and yet the\\nposition of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was; it was also\\ncertain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not been able\\nto escape. But how were they to be got at?\\n\\nHerbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and shooting the\\narrow so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder\\nwhich hung from the threshold. By means of the cord they would then\\nbe able to draw down the ladder to the ground, and so re-establish the\\ncommunication between the beach and Granite House. There was evidently\\nnothing else to be done, and, with a little skill, this method might\\nsucceed. Very fortunately bows and arrows had been left at the Chimneys,\\nwhere they also found a quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft\\nfastened this to a well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his\\nbow, took a careful aim for the lower part of the ladder.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so as to see\\nif anything appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted his gun to his\\nshoulder and covered the door.\\n\\nThe bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and passed\\nbetween the two last rounds.\\n\\nThe operation had succeeded.\\n\\nHerbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that moment when\\nhe gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm, thrust suddenly out\\nbetween the wall and the door, grasped it and dragged it inside Granite\\nHouse.\\n\\n“The rascals!” shouted the sailor. “If a ball can do anything for you,\\nyou shall not have long to wait for it.\\n\\n“But who was it?” asked Neb.\\n\\n“Who was it? Didn’t you see?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“It was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a gorilla, a\\nsagoin. Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who climbed up the\\nladder during our absence.”\\n\\nAnd, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor’s\\nwords, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows,\\nfrom which they had pushed back the shutters, and saluted the real\\nproprietors of the place with a thousand hideous grimaces.\\n\\n“I knew that it was only a joke,” cried Pencroft; “but one of the jokers\\nshall pay the penalty for the rest.”\\n\\nSo saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at one of the\\nmonkeys and fired. All disappeared, except one who fell mortally wounded\\non the beach. This monkey, which was of a large size, evidently belonged\\nto the first order of the quadrumana. Whether this was a chimpanzee, an\\norangoutang, or a gorilla, he took rank among the anthropoid apes, who\\nare so called from their resemblance to the human race. However, Herbert\\ndeclared it to be an orangoutang.\\n\\n“What a magnificent beast!” cried Neb.\\n\\n“Magnificent, if you like,” replied Pencroft; “but still I do not see\\nhow we are to get into our house.”\\n\\n“Herbert is a good marksman,” said the reporter, “and his bow is here.\\nHe can try again.”\\n\\n“Why, these apes are so cunning,” returned Pencroft; “they won’t show\\nthemselves again at the windows and so we can’t kill them; and when I\\nthink of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse--”\\n\\n“Have patience,” replied Harding; “these creatures cannot keep us long\\nat bay.”\\n\\n“I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here,” replied the\\nsailor. “And now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows\\nare up there?”\\n\\nIt was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making\\nanother attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder\\nhad been drawn again into the door, and when another pull was given, the\\nline broke and the ladder remained firm. The case was really perplexing.\\nPencroft stormed. There was a comic side to the situation, but he did\\nnot think it funny at all. It was certain that the settlers would end by\\nreinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders,\\nbut when and how? this is what they were not able to say.\\n\\nTwo hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show\\nthemselves, but they were still there, and three or four times a nose or\\na paw was poked out at the door or windows, and was immediately saluted\\nby a gun-shot.\\n\\n“Let us hide ourselves,” at last said the engineer. “Perhaps the apes\\nwill think we have gone quite away and will show themselves again. Let\\nSpilett and Herbert conceal themselves behind those rocks and fire on\\nall that may appear.”\\n\\nThe engineer’s orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and the lad,\\nthe best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a good position,\\nbut out of the monkeys’ sight, Neb, Pencroft, and Cyrus climbed the\\nplateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game, for it was\\nnow time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining.\\n\\nIn half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons, which they\\nroasted as well as they could. Not an ape had appeared. Gideon Spilett\\nand Herbert went to take their share of the breakfast, leaving Top to\\nwatch under the windows. They then, having eaten, returned to their\\npost.\\n\\nTwo hours later, their situation was in no degree improved. The\\nquadrumana gave no sign of existence, and it might have been supposed\\nthat they had disappeared; but what seemed more probable was that,\\nterrified by the death of one of their companions, and frightened by the\\nnoise of the firearms, they had retreated to the back part of the house\\nor probably even into the store-room. And when they thought of\\nthe valuables which this storeroom contained, the patience so much\\nrecommended by the engineer, fast changed into great irritation, and\\nthere certainly was room for it.\\n\\n“Decidedly it is too bad,” said the reporter; “and the worst of it is,\\nthere is no way of putting an end to it.”\\n\\n“But we must drive these vagabonds out somehow,” cried the sailor.\\n“We could soon get the better of them, even if there are twenty of the\\nrascals; but for that, we must meet them hand to hand. Come now, is\\nthere no way of getting at them?”\\n\\n“Let us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the lake,”\\n replied the engineer.\\n\\n“Oh!” shouted the sailor, “and I never thought of that.”\\n\\nThis was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into Granite\\nHouse so as to fight with and drive out the intruders. The opening was,\\nit is true, closed up with a wall of cemented stones, which it would be\\nnecessary to sacrifice, but that could easily be rebuilt. Fortunately,\\nCyrus Harding had not as yet effected his project of hiding this opening\\nby raising the waters of the lake, for the operation would then have\\ntaken some time.\\n\\nIt was already past twelve o’clock, when the colonists, well armed and\\nprovided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed beneath the\\nwindows of Granite House, after telling Top to remain at his post, and\\nbegan to ascend the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect\\nHeights.\\n\\nBut they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they heard the\\ndog barking furiously.\\n\\nAnd all rushed down the bank again.\\n\\nArrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had changed.\\n\\nIn fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown cause,\\nwere trying to escape. Two or three ran and clambered from one window\\nto another with the agility of acrobats. They were not even trying to\\nreplace the ladder, by which it would have been easy to descend; perhaps\\nin their terror they had forgotten this way of escape. The colonists,\\nnow being able to take aim without difficulty, fired. Some, wounded or\\nkilled, fell back into the rooms, uttering piercing cries. The rest,\\nthrowing themselves out, were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a\\nfew minutes, so far as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in\\nGranite House.\\n\\nAt this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold, then\\nunroll and fall to the ground.\\n\\n“Hullo!” cried the sailor, “this is queer!”\\n\\n“Very strange!” murmured the engineer, leaping first up the ladder.\\n\\n“Take care, captain!” cried Pencroft, “perhaps there are still some of\\nthese rascals.\\n\\n“We shall soon see,” replied the engineer, without stopping however.\\n\\nAll his companions followed him, and in a minute they had arrived at the\\nthreshold. They searched everywhere. There was no one in the rooms nor\\nin the storehouse, which had been respected by the band of quadrumana.\\n\\n“Well now, and the ladder,” cried the sailor; “who can the gentleman\\nhave been who sent us that down?”\\n\\nBut at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had hidden\\nhimself in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by Neb.\\n\\n“Ah, the robber!” cried Pencroft.\\n\\nAnd hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the animal, when\\nCyrus Harding seized his arm, saying,--\\n\\n“Spare him, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“Pardon this rascal?”\\n\\n“Yes! it was he who threw us the ladder!”\\n\\nAnd the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was\\ndifficult to know whether he spoke seriously or not.\\n\\nNevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended himself\\ngallantly, but was soon overpowered and bound.\\n\\n“There!” said Pencroft. “And what shall we make of him, now we’ve got\\nhim?”\\n\\n“A servant!” replied Herbert.\\n\\nThe lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this intelligent\\nrace could be turned to account.\\n\\nThe settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively. He\\nbelonged to the family of anthropoid apes, of which the facial angle is\\nnot much inferior to that of the Australians and Hottentots. It was an\\norangoutang, and as such, had neither the ferocity of the gorilla, nor\\nthe stupidity of the baboon. It is to this family of the anthropoid apes\\nthat so many characteristics belong which prove them to be possessed\\nof an almost human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait at\\ntable, sweep rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork,\\nand spoon properly, and even drink wine... doing everything as well as\\nthe best servant that ever walked upon two legs. Buffon possessed one\\nof these apes, who served him for a long time as a faithful and zealous\\nservant.\\n\\nThe one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a great\\nfellow, six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a broad\\nchest, head of a moderate size, the facial angle reaching sixty-five\\ndegrees, round skull, projecting nose, skin covered with soft glossy\\nhair, in short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids. His eyes, rather\\nsmaller than human eyes, sparkled with intelligence; his white teeth\\nglittered under his mustache, and he wore a little curly brown beard.\\n\\n“A handsome fellow!” said Pencroft; “if we only knew his language, we\\ncould talk to him.”\\n\\n“But, master,” said Neb, “are you serious? Are we going to take him as a\\nservant?”\\n\\n“Yes, Neb,” replied the engineer, smiling. “But you must not be\\njealous.”\\n\\n“And I hope he will make an excellent servant,” added Herbert. “He\\nappears young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be obliged\\nto use force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is sometimes done. He\\nwill soon grow fond of his masters if they are kind to him.”\\n\\n“And they will be,” replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his rancor\\nagainst “the jokers.”\\n\\nThen, approaching the orang,--\\n\\n“Well, old boy!” he asked, “how are you?”\\n\\nThe orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger.\\n\\n“You wish to join the colony?” again asked the sailor. “You are going to\\nenter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?”\\n\\nAnother respondent grunt was uttered by the ape.\\n\\n“And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?”\\n\\nThird affirmative grunt.\\n\\n“This conversation is slightly monotonous,” observed Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“So much the better,” replied Pencroft; “the best servants are those who\\ntalk the least. And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy? We will give\\nyou no wages at first, but we will double them afterwards if we are\\npleased with you.”\\n\\nThus the colony was increased by a new member. As to his name the sailor\\nbegged that in memory of another ape which he had known, he might be\\ncalled Jupiter, and Jup for short.\\n\\nAnd so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in Granite\\nHouse.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\nThe settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling, without\\nhaving been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and were therefore\\nspared the trouble of mason’s work. It was certainly lucky, that at the\\nmoment they were about to set out to do so, the apes had been seized\\nwith that terror, no less sudden than inexplicable, which had driven\\nthem out of Granite House. Had the animals discovered that they\\nwere about to be attacked from another direction? This was the only\\nexplanation of their sudden retreat.\\n\\nDuring the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the wood, where\\nthey were buried; then the settlers busied themselves in repairing the\\ndisorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not damage, for although\\nthey had turned everything in the rooms topsy-turvy, yet they had broken\\nnothing. Neb relighted his stove, and the stores in the larder furnished\\na substantial repast, to which all did ample justice.\\n\\nJup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine almonds\\nand rhizome roots, with which he was abundantly supplied. Pencroft had\\nunfastened his arms, but judged it best to have his legs tied until they\\nwere more sure of his submission.\\n\\nThen, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated round\\ntheir table, discussed those plans, the execution of which was most\\npressing. The most important and most urgent was the establishment of a\\nbridge over the Mercy, so as to form a communication with the southern\\npart of the island and Granite House; then the making of an enclosure\\nfor the musmons or other woolly animals which they wished to capture.\\n\\nThese two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to their\\nclothing, which was now serious. The bridge would render easy the\\ntransport of the balloon case, which would furnish them with linen, and\\nthe inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which would supply\\nthem with winter clothes.\\n\\nAs to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding’s intention to establish it at\\nthe sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants would find fresh and\\nabundant pasture. The road between Prospect Heights and the sources of\\nthe stream was already partly beaten, and with a better cart than the\\nfirst, the material could be easily conveyed to the spot, especially if\\nthey could manage to capture some animals to draw it.\\n\\nBut though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far\\nfrom Granite House, it would not be the same with the poultry-yard, to\\nwhich Neb called the attention of the colonists. It was indeed necessary\\nthat the birds should be close within reach of the cook, and no place\\nappeared more favorable for the establishment of the said poultry-yard\\nthan that portion of the banks of the lake which was close to the old\\nopening.\\n\\nWater-birds would prosper there as well as others, and the couple\\nof tinamous taken in their last excursion would be the first to be\\ndomesticated.\\n\\nThe next day, the 3rd of November, the new works were begun by the\\nconstruction of the bridge, and all hands were required for this\\nimportant task. Saws, hatchets, and hammers were shouldered by the\\nsettlers, who, now transformed into carpenters, descended to the shore.\\n\\nThere Pencroft observed,--\\n\\n“Suppose, that during our absence, Master Jup takes it into his head to\\ndraw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us yesterday?”\\n\\n“Let us tie its lower end down firmly,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nThis was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand. Then\\nthe settlers, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, soon arrived at the\\nangle formed by the river.\\n\\nThere they halted, in order to ascertain if the bridge could be thrown\\nacross. The place appeared suitable.\\n\\nIn fact, from this spot, to Port Balloon, discovered the day before on\\nthe southern coast, there was only a distance of three miles and a\\nhalf, and from the bridge to the Port, it would be easy to make a good\\ncart-road which would render the communication between Granite House and\\nthe south of the island extremely easy.\\n\\nCyrus Harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely\\nisolating Prospect Heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of\\nquadrupeds and quadrumana. In this way, Granite House, the Chimneys, the\\npoultry-yard, and all the upper part of the plateau which was to be used\\nfor cultivation, would be protected against the depredations of animals.\\nNothing could be easier than to execute this project, and this is how\\nthe engineer intended to set to work.\\n\\nThe plateau was already defended on three sides by water-courses, either\\nartificial or natural. On the northwest, by the shores of Lake Grant,\\nfrom the entrance of the passage to the breach made in the banks of the\\nlake for the escape of the water.\\n\\nOn the north, from this breach to the sea, by the new water-course which\\nhad hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore, above\\nand below the fall, and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek\\na little deeper to make it impracticable for animals, on all the eastern\\nborder by the sea itself, from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the\\nmouth of the Mercy.\\n\\nLastly, on the south, from the mouth to the turn of the Mercy where the\\nbridge was to be established.\\n\\nThe western border of the plateau now remained between the turn of the\\nriver and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of about a mile,\\nwhich was open to all comers. But nothing could be easier than to dig a\\nbroad deep ditch, which could be filled from the lake, and the overflow\\nof which would throw itself by a rapid fall into the bed of the Mercy.\\nThe level of the lake would, no doubt, be somewhat lowered by this fresh\\ndischarge of its waters, but Cyrus Harding had ascertained that the\\nvolume of water in the Red Creek was considerable enough to allow of the\\nexecution of this project.\\n\\n“So then,” added the engineer, “Prospect Heights will become a regular\\nisland, being surrounded with water on all sides, and only communicating\\nwith the rest of our domain by the bridge which we are about to throw\\nacross the Mercy, the two little bridges already established above and\\nbelow the fall; and, lastly, two other little bridges which must be\\nconstructed, one over the canal which I propose to dig, the other across\\nto the left bank of the Mercy. Now, if these bridges can be raised at\\nwill, Prospect Heights will be guarded from any surprise.”\\n\\nThe bridge was the most urgent work. Trees were selected, cut down,\\nstripped of their branches, and cut into beams, joists, and planks. The\\nend of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the Mercy was to be\\nfirm, but the other end on the left bank was to be movable, so that it\\nmight be raised by means of a counterpoise, as some canal bridges are\\nmanaged.\\n\\nThis was certainly a considerable work, and though it was skillfully\\nconducted, it took some time, for the Mercy at this place was eighty\\nfeet wide. It was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of\\nthe river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a\\npile-driver to act on the tops of these piles, which would thus form two\\narches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads.\\n\\nHappily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood, nor\\nof iron-work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who had a\\nmarvelous knowledge of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his companions,\\nwho in seven months had necessarily acquired great skill in the use of\\ntheir tools; and it must be said that not the least skilful was Gideon\\nSpilett, who in dexterity almost equaled the sailor himself. “Who would\\never have expected so much from a newspaper man!” thought Pencroft.\\n\\nThe construction of the Mercy bridge lasted three weeks of regular\\nhard work. They even breakfasted on the scene of their labors, and the\\nweather being magnificent, they only returned to Granite House to sleep.\\n\\nDuring this period it may be stated that Master Jup grew more accustomed\\nto his new masters, whose movements he always watched with very\\ninquisitive eyes. However, as a precautionary measure, Pencroft did not\\nas yet allow him complete liberty, rightly wishing to wait until the\\nlimits of the plateau should be settled by the projected works. Top\\nand Jup were good friends and played willingly together, but Jup did\\neverything solemnly.\\n\\nOn the 20th of November the bridge was finished. The movable part,\\nbalanced by the counterpoise, swung easily, and only a slight effort was\\nneeded to raise it; between its hinge and the last cross-bar on which\\nit rested when closed, there existed a space of twenty feet, which was\\nsufficiently wide to prevent any animals from crossing.\\n\\nThe settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon-case, which they\\nwere anxious to place in perfect security; but to bring it, it would be\\nnecessary to take a cart to Port Balloon, and consequently, necessary to\\nbeat a road through the dense forests of the Far West. This would take\\nsome time. Also, Neb and Pencroft having gone to examine into the state\\nof things at Port Balloon, and reported that the stock of cloth would\\nsuffer no damage in the grotto where it was stored, it was decided that\\nthe work at Prospect Heights should not be discontinued.\\n\\n“That,” observed Pencroft, “will enable us to establish our poultry-yard\\nunder better conditions, since we need have no fear of visits from foxes\\nnor the attacks of other beasts.”\\n\\n“Then,” added Neb, “we can clear the plateau, and transplant wild plants\\nto it.”\\n\\n“And prepare our second corn-field!” cried the sailor with a triumphant\\nair.\\n\\nIn fact, the first corn-field sown with a single grain had prospered\\nadmirably, thanks to Pencroft’s care. It had produced the ten ears\\nforetold by the engineer, and each ear containing eighty grains, the\\ncolony found itself in possession of eight hundred grains, in six\\nmonths, which promised a double harvest each year.\\n\\nThese eight hundred grains, except fifty, which were prudently reserved,\\nwere to be sown in a new field, but with no less care than was bestowed\\non the single grain.\\n\\nThe field was prepared, then surrounded with a strong palisade, high and\\npointed, which quadrupeds would have found difficulty in leaping. As to\\nbirds, some scarecrows, due to Pencroft’s ingenious brain, were enough\\nto frighten them. The seven hundred and fifty grains deposited in very\\nregular furrows were then left for nature to do the rest.\\n\\nOn the 21st of November, Cyrus Harding began to plan the canal which was\\nto close the plateau on the west, from the south angle of Lake Grant to\\nthe angle of the Mercy. There was there two or three feet of vegetable\\nearth, and below that granite. It was therefore necessary to manufacture\\nsome more nitro-glycerine, and the nitro-glycerine did its accustomed\\nwork. In less than a fortnight a ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep,\\nwas dug out in the hard ground of the plateau. A new trench was made by\\nthe same means in the rocky border of the lake, forming a small stream,\\nto which they gave the name of Creek Glycerine, and which was thus an\\naffluent of the Mercy. As the engineer had predicted, the level of the\\nlake was lowered, though very slightly. To complete the enclosure the\\nbed of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand\\nsupported by means of stakes.\\n\\nBy the end of the first fortnight of December these works were finished,\\nand Prospect Heights--that is to say, a sort of irregular pentagon,\\nhaving a perimeter of nearly four miles, surrounded by a liquid\\nbelt--was completely protected from depredators of every description.\\n\\nDuring the month of December, the heat was very great. In spite of it,\\nhowever, the settlers continued their work, and as they were anxious to\\npossess a poultry-yard they forthwith commenced it.\\n\\nIt is useless to say that since the enclosing of the plateau had been\\ncompleted, Master Jup had been set at liberty. He did not leave his\\nmasters, and evinced no wish to escape. He was a gentle animal, though\\nvery powerful and wonderfully active. He was already taught to make\\nhimself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones\\nwhich were extracted from the bed of Creek Glycerine.\\n\\nThe poultry-yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards, on the\\nsoutheastern bank of the lake. It was surrounded by a palisade, and\\nin it were constructed various shelters for the birds which were to\\npopulate it. These were simply built of branches and divided into\\ncompartments, made ready for the expected guests.\\n\\nThe first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a number\\nof young ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks, accustomed to\\nthe borders of the lake. Some belonged to the Chinese species, of which\\nthe wings open like a fan, and which by the brilliancy of their plumage\\nrival the golden pheasants. A few days afterwards, Herbert snared a\\ncouple of gallinaceae, with spreading tails composed of long feathers,\\nmagnificent alectors, which soon became tame. As to pelicans,\\nkingfishers, water-hens, they came of themselves to the shores of the\\npoultry-yard, and this little community, after some disputes, cooing,\\nscreaming, clucking, ended by settling down peacefully, and increased in\\nencouraging proportion for the future use of the colony.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established a\\npigeon-house in a corner of the poultry-yard. There he lodged a dozen\\nof those pigeons which frequented the rocks of the plateau. These birds\\nsoon became accustomed to returning every evening to their new dwelling,\\nand showed more disposition to domesticate themselves than their\\ncongeners, the wood-pigeons.\\n\\nLastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use, by\\ncutting it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to keeping it in\\nits present form, and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas,\\nabove a sea of the limits of which they had no idea, it was not to be\\nthought of.\\n\\nIt was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the colonists\\nemployed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more\\nmanageable. But though they had a vehicle, the moving power was yet to\\nbe found.\\n\\nBut did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the\\nplace of the horse, ass, or ox? That was the question.\\n\\n“Certainly,” said Pencroft, “a beast of burden would be very useful to\\nus until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an engine, for some\\nday we shall have a railroad from Granite House to Port Balloon, with a\\nbranch line to Mount Franklin!”\\n\\nOne day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting and\\nbarking, each apparently trying to see who could make the most noise.\\nThe settlers, who were busy at the Chimneys, ran, fearing some vexatious\\nincident.\\n\\nWhat did they see? Two fine animals of a large size that had imprudently\\nventured on the plateau, when the bridges were open. One would have said\\nthey were horses, or at least donkeys, male and female, of a fine shape,\\ndove-colored, the legs and tail white, striped with black on the head\\nand neck. They advanced quietly without showing any uneasiness, and\\ngazed at the men, in whom they could not as yet recognize their future\\nmasters.\\n\\n“These are onagers!” cried Herbert, “animals something between the zebra\\nand the quagga!”\\n\\n“Why not donkeys?” asked Neb.\\n\\n“Because they have not long ears, and their shape is more graceful!”\\n\\n“Donkeys or horses,” interrupted Pencroft, “they are ‘moving powers,’ as\\nthe captain would say, and as such must be captured!”\\n\\nThe sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the grass\\nto the bridge over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the onagers were\\nprisoners.\\n\\nNow, should they seize them with violence and master them by force? No.\\nIt was decided that for a few days they should be allowed to roam\\nfreely about the plateau, where there was an abundance of grass, and the\\nengineer immediately began to prepare a stable near the poultry-yard,\\nin which the onagers might find food, with a good litter, and shelter\\nduring the night.\\n\\nThis done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were left\\nentirely free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them so as to\\nterrify them. Several times, however, the onagers appeared to wish to\\nleave the plateau, too confined for animals accustomed to the plains\\nand forests. They were then seen following the water-barrier which\\neverywhere presented itself before them, uttering short neighs, then\\ngalloping through the grass, and becoming calmer, they would remain\\nentire hours gazing at the woods, from which they were cut off for ever!\\n\\nIn the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured, and\\nsome days after the capture of the onagers, not only the cart was ready,\\nbut a straight road, or rather a cutting, had been made through the\\nforests of the Far West, from the angle of the Mercy to Port Balloon.\\nThe cart might then be driven there, and towards the end of December\\nthey tried the onagers for the first time.\\n\\nPencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of his hand,\\nand they allowed him to approach without making any difficulty, but once\\nharnessed they reared and could with difficulty be held in. However, it\\nwas not long before they submitted to this new service, for the onager,\\nbeing less refractory than the zebra, is frequently put in harness\\nin the mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and it has even been\\nacclimatized in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness.\\n\\nOn this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the animals’\\nheads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port Balloon.\\n\\nOf course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the vehicle\\narrived without any accident, and was soon loaded with the case and\\nrigging of the balloon.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock that evening the cart, after passing over the Mercy\\nbridge, descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on the beach.\\nThe onagers being unharnessed, were thence led to their stable, and\\nPencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his feelings in a deep sigh\\nof satisfaction that awoke all the echoes of Granite House.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\nThe first week of January was devoted to the manufacture of the linen\\ngarments required by the colony. The needles found in the box were used\\nby sturdy if not delicate fingers, and we may be sure that what was sewn\\nwas sewn firmly.\\n\\nThere was no lack of thread, thanks to Cyrus Harding’s idea of\\nre-employing that which had been already used in the covering of the\\nballoon. This with admirable patience was all unpicked by Gideon Spilett\\nand Herbert, for Pencroft had been obliged to give this work up, as it\\nirritated him beyond measure; but he had no equal in the sewing part\\nof the business. Indeed, everybody knows that sailors have a remarkable\\naptitude for tailoring.\\n\\nThe cloth of which the balloon-case was made was then cleaned by means\\nof soda and potash, obtained by the incineration of plants, in such a\\nway that the cotton, having got rid of the varnish, resumed its natural\\nsoftness and elasticity; then, exposed to the action of the atmosphere,\\nit soon became perfectly white. Some dozen shirts and sock--the latter\\nnot knitted, of course, but made of cotton--were thus manufactured. What\\na comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves again in clean\\nlinen, which was doubtless rather rough, but they were not troubled\\nabout that! and then to go to sleep between sheets, which made the\\ncouches at Granite House into quite comfortable beds!\\n\\nIt was about this time also that they made boots of seal-leather, which\\nwere greatly needed to replace the shoes and boots brought from America.\\nWe may be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched\\nthe feet of the wearers.\\n\\nWith the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great, but\\nthe hunting in the forests did not stand still. Agouties, peccaries,\\ncapybaras, kangaroos, game of all sorts, actually swarmed there, and\\nSpilett and Herbert were too good marksmen ever to throw away their shot\\nuselessly.\\n\\nCyrus Harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition, and he\\ntook measures to replace the powder and shot which had been found in\\nthe box, and which he wished to reserve for the future. How did he know\\nwhere chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the\\nevent of their leaving their domain? They should, then, prepare for the\\nunknown future by husbanding their ammunition and by substituting for it\\nsome easily renewable substance.\\n\\nTo replace lead, of which Harding had found no traces in the island, he\\nemployed granulated iron, which was easy to manufacture. These bullets,\\nnot having the weight of leaden bullets, were made larger, and each\\ncharge contained less, but the skill of the sportsmen made up this\\ndeficiency. As to powder, Cyrus Harding would have been able to make\\nthat also, for he had at his disposal saltpeter, sulphur, and coal; but\\nthis preparation requires extreme care, and without special tools it is\\ndifficult to produce it of a good quality. Harding preferred, therefore,\\nto manufacture pyroxyle, that is to say gun-cotton, a substance in which\\ncotton is not indispensable, as the elementary tissue of vegetables may\\nbe used, and this is found in an almost pure state, not only in cotton,\\nbut in the textile fiber of hemp and flax, in paper, the pith of the\\nelder, etc. Now, the elder abounded in the island towards the mouth of\\nRed Creek, and the colonists had already made coffee of the berries of\\nthese shrubs, which belong to the family of the caprifoliaceae.\\n\\nThe only thing to be collected, therefore, was elder-pith, for as to the\\nother substance necessary for the manufacture of pyroxyle, it was only\\nfuming azotic acid. Now, Harding having sulphuric acid at his disposal,\\nhad already been easily able to produce azotic acid by attacking the\\nsaltpeter with which nature supplied him. He accordingly resolved to\\nmanufacture and employ pyroxyle, although it has some inconveniences,\\nthat is to say, a great inequality of effect, an excessive\\ninflammability, since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy\\ndegrees instead of two hundred and forty, and lastly, an instantaneous\\ndeflagration which might damage the firearms. On the other hand, the\\nadvantages of pyroxyle consist in this, that it is not injured by damp,\\nthat it does not make the gun-barrels dirty, and that its force is four\\ntimes that of ordinary powder.\\n\\nTo make pyroxyle, the cotton must be immersed in the fuming azotic acid\\nfor a quarter of an hour, then washed in cold water and dried. Nothing\\ncould be more simple.\\n\\nCyrus Harding had only at his disposal the ordinary azotic acid and not\\nthe fuming or monohydrate azotic acid, that is to say, acid which emits\\nwhite vapors when it comes in contact with damp air; but by substituting\\nfor the latter ordinary azotic acid, mixed, in the proportion of from\\nthree to five volumes of concentrated sulphuric acid, the engineer\\nobtained the same result. The sportsmen of the island therefore soon\\nhad a perfectly prepared substance, which, employed discreetly, produced\\nadmirable results.\\n\\nAbout this time the settlers cleared three acres of the plateau, and\\nthe rest was preserved in a wild state, for the benefit of the onagers.\\nSeveral excursions were made into the Jacamar Wood and the forests of\\nthe Far West, and they brought back from thence a large collection of\\nwild vegetables, spinach, cress, radishes, and turnips, which careful\\nculture would soon improve, and which would temper the regimen on which\\nthe settlers had till then subsisted. Supplies of wood and coal were\\nalso carted. Each excursion was at the same time a means of improving\\nthe roads, which gradually became smoother under the wheels of the cart.\\n\\nThe rabbit-warren still continued to supply the larder of Granite House.\\nAs fortunately it was situated on the other side of Creek Glycerine,\\nits inhabitants could not reach the plateau nor ravage the newly-made\\nplantation. The oyster-bed among the rocks was frequently renewed and\\nfurnished excellent molluscs. Besides that, the fishing, either in\\nthe lake or the Mercy, was very profitable, for Pencroft had made some\\nlines, armed with iron hooks, with which they frequently caught fine\\ntrout, and a species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with\\nyellow, and which were also extremely savory. Master Neb, who was\\nskilled in the culinary art, knew how to vary agreeably the bill of\\nfare. Bread alone was wanting at the table of the settlers, and as has\\nbeen said, they felt this privation greatly.\\n\\nThe settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores of\\nCape Mandible. At this place the beach was covered with little mounds,\\nconcealing perfectly spherical turtles’ eggs, with white hard shells,\\nthe albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds’ eggs. They\\nwere hatched by the sun, and their number was naturally considerable, as\\neach turtle can lay annually two hundred and fifty.\\n\\n“A regular egg-field,” observed Gideon Spilett, “and we have nothing to\\ndo but to pick them up.”\\n\\nBut not being contented with simply the produce, they made chase after\\nthe producers, the result of which was that they were able to bring back\\nto Granite House a dozen of these chelonians, which were really valuable\\nfrom an alimentary point of view. The turtle soup, flavored with\\naromatic herbs, often gained well-merited praises for its preparer, Neb.\\n\\nWe must here mention another fortunate circumstance by which new stores\\nfor the winter were laid in. Shoals of salmon entered the Mercy, and\\nascended the country for several miles. It was the time at which the\\nfemales, going to find suitable places in which to spawn, precede the\\nmales and make a great noise through the fresh water. A thousand of\\nthese fish, which measured about two feet and a half in length, came up\\nthe river, and a large quantity were retained by fixing dams across\\nthe stream. More than a hundred were thus taken, which were salted and\\nstored for the time when winter, freezing up the streams, would render\\nfishing impracticable. By this time the intelligent Jup was raised\\nto the duty of valet. He had been dressed in a jacket, white linen\\nbreeches, and an apron, the pockets of which were his delight. The\\nclever orang had been marvelously trained by Neb, and any one would have\\nsaid that the Negro and the ape understood each other when they talked\\ntogether. Jup had besides a real affection for Neb, and Neb returned\\nit. When his services were not required, either for carrying wood or for\\nclimbing to the top of some tree, Jup passed the greatest part of his\\ntime in the kitchen, where he endeavored to imitate Neb in all that he\\nsaw him do. The black showed the greatest patience and even extreme\\nzeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil exhibited remarkable\\nintelligence in profiting by the lessons he received from his master.\\n\\nJudge then of the pleasure Master Jup gave to the inhabitants of Granite\\nHouse when, without their having had any idea of it, he appeared one\\nday, napkin on his arm, ready to wait at table. Quick, attentive, he\\nacquitted himself perfectly, changing the plates, bringing dishes,\\npouring out water, all with a gravity which gave intense amusement to\\nthe settlers, and which enraptured Pencroft.\\n\\n“Jup, some soup!”\\n\\n“Jup, a little agouti!”\\n\\n“Jup, a plate!”\\n\\n“Jup! Good Jup! Honest Jup!”\\n\\nNothing was heard but that, and Jup without ever being disconcerted,\\nreplied to every one, watched for everything, and he shook his head in a\\nknowing way when Pencroft, referring to his joke of the first day, said\\nto him,--\\n\\n“Decidedly, Jup, your wages must be doubled.”\\n\\nIt is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly domesticated at\\nGranite House, and that he often accompanied his masters to the forest\\nwithout showing any wish to leave them. It was most amusing to see him\\nwalking with a stick which Pencroft had given him, and which he carried\\non his shoulder like a gun. If they wished to gather some fruit from\\nthe summit of a tree, how quickly he climbed for it. If the wheel of the\\ncart stuck in the mud, with what energy did Jup with a single heave of\\nhis shoulder put it right again.\\n\\n“What a jolly fellow he is!” cried Pencroft often. “If he was as\\nmischievous as he is good, there would be no doing anything with him!”\\n\\nIt was towards the end of January the colonists began their labors in\\nthe center of the island. It had been decided that a corral should be\\nestablished near the sources of the Red Creek, at the foot of Mount\\nFranklin, destined to contain the ruminants, whose presence would have\\nbeen troublesome at Granite House, and especially for the musmons, who\\nwere to supply the wool for the settlers’ winter garments.\\n\\nEach morning, the colony, sometimes entire, but more often represented\\nonly by Harding, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the sources of the\\nCreek, a distance of not more than five miles, by the newly beaten road\\nto which the name of Corral Road had been given.\\n\\nThere a site was chosen, at the back of the southern ridge of the\\nmountain. It was a meadow land, dotted here and there with clumps of\\ntrees, and watered by a little stream, which sprung from the slopes\\nwhich closed it in on one side. The grass was fresh, and it was not\\ntoo much shaded by the trees which grew about it. This meadow was to\\nbe surrounded by a palisade, high enough to prevent even the most agile\\nanimals from leaping over. This enclosure would be large enough to\\ncontain a hundred musmons and wild goats, with all the young ones they\\nmight produce.\\n\\nThe perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer, and\\nthey would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the\\nconstruction of the palisade, but as the opening up of the road had\\nalready necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number, those were\\nbrought and supplied a hundred stakes, which were firmly fixed in the\\nground.\\n\\nThe construction of this corral did not take less than three weeks,\\nfor besides the palisade, Cyrus Harding built large sheds, in which the\\nanimals could take shelter. These buildings had also to be made very\\nstrong, for musmons are powerful animals, and their first fury was to be\\nfeared. The stakes, sharpened at their upper end and hardened by fire,\\nhad been fixed by means of cross-bars, and at regular distances props\\nassured the solidity of the whole.\\n\\nThe corral finished, a raid had to be made on the pastures frequented\\nby the ruminants. This was done on the 7th of February, on a beautiful\\nsummer’s day, and every one took part in it. The onagers, already well\\ntrained, were ridden by Spilett and Herbert, and were of great use.\\n\\nThe maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats, and\\ngradually narrowing the circle around them. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft,\\nNeb, and Jup, posted themselves in different parts of the wood, while\\nthe two cavaliers and Top galloped in a radius of half a mile round the\\ncorral.\\n\\nThe musmons were very numerous in this part of the island. These fine\\nanimals were as large as deer; their horns were stronger than those of\\nthe ram, and their gray-colored fleece was mixed with long hair.\\n\\nThis hunting day was very fatiguing. Such going and coming, and running\\nand riding and shouting! Of a hundred musmons which had been surrounded,\\nmore than two-thirds escaped, but at last, thirty of these animals and\\nten wild goats were gradually driven back towards the corral, the open\\ndoor of which appearing to offer a means of escape, they rushed in and\\nwere prisoners.\\n\\nIn short, the result was satisfactory, and the settlers had no reason to\\ncomplain. There was no doubt that the flock would prosper, and that at\\nno distant time not only wool but hides would be abundant.\\n\\nThat evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite exhausted.\\nHowever, notwithstanding their fatigue, they returned the next day\\nto visit the corral. The prisoners had been trying to overthrow the\\npalisade, but of course had not succeeded, and were not long in becoming\\nmore tranquil.\\n\\nDuring the month of February, no event of any importance occurred. The\\ndaily labors were pursued methodically, and, as well as improving the\\nroads to the corral and to Port Balloon, a third was commenced, which,\\nstarting from the enclosure, proceeded towards the western coast. The\\nyet unknown portion of Lincoln Island was that of the wood-covered\\nSerpentine Peninsula, which sheltered the wild beasts, from which Gideon\\nSpilett was so anxious to clear their domain.\\n\\nBefore the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was given\\nto the cultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted from\\nthe forest to Prospect Heights. Herbert never returned from an excursion\\nwithout bringing home some useful vegetable. One day, it was some\\nspecimens of the chicory tribe, the seeds of which by pressure yield an\\nexcellent oil; another, it was some common sorrel, whose antiscorbutic\\nqualities were not to be despised; then, some of those precious tubers,\\nwhich have at all times been cultivated in South America, potatoes, of\\nwhich more than two hundred species are now known. The kitchen garden,\\nnow well stocked and carefully defended from the birds, was divided\\ninto small beds, where grew lettuces, kidney potatoes, sorrel, turnips,\\nradishes, and other coneiferae. The soil on the plateau was particularly\\nfertile, and it was hoped that the harvests would be abundant.\\n\\nThey had also a variety of different beverages, and so long as they did\\nnot demand wine, the most hard to please would have had no reason to\\ncomplain. To the Oswego tea, and the fermented liquor extracted from the\\nroots of the dragonnier, Harding had added a regular beer, made from\\nthe young shoots of the spruce-fir, which, after having been boiled\\nand fermented, made that agreeable drink called by the Anglo-Americans\\nspring-beer.\\n\\nTowards the end of the summer, the poultry-yard was possessed of\\na couple of fine bustards, which belonged to the houbara species,\\ncharacterized by a sort of feathery mantle; a dozen shovelers, whose\\nupper mandible was prolonged on each side by a membraneous appendage;\\nand also some magnificent cocks, similar to the Mozambique cocks,\\nthe comb, caruncle, and epidermis being black. So far, everything had\\nsucceeded, thanks to the activity of these courageous and intelligent\\nmen. Nature did much for them, doubtless; but faithful to the great\\nprecept, they made a right use of what a bountiful Providence gave them.\\n\\nAfter the heat of these warm summer days, in the evening when their work\\nwas finished and the sea-breeze began to blow, they liked to sit on the\\nedge of Prospect Heights, in a sort of veranda, covered with creepers,\\nwhich Neb had made with his own hands. There they talked, they\\ninstructed each other, they made plans, and the rough good-humor of\\nthe sailor always amused this little world, in which the most perfect\\nharmony had never ceased to reign.\\n\\nThey often spoke of their country, of their dear and great America. What\\nwas the result of the War of Secession? It could not have been greatly\\nprolonged. Richmond had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of General\\nGrant. The taking of the capital of the Confederates must have been the\\nlast action of this terrible struggle. Now the North had triumphed in\\nthe good cause, how welcome would have been a newspaper to the exiles in\\nLincoln Island! For eleven months all communication between them and the\\nrest of their fellow-creatures had been interrupted, and in a short time\\nthe 24th of March would arrive, the anniversary of the day on which\\nthe balloon had thrown them on this unknown coast. They were then mere\\ncastaways, not even knowing how they should preserve their miserable\\nlives from the fury of the elements! And now, thanks to the knowledge of\\ntheir captain, and their own intelligence, they were regular colonists,\\nfurnished with arms, tools, and instruments; they had been able to turn\\nto their profit the animals, plants, and minerals of the island, that is\\nto say, the three kingdoms of Nature.\\n\\nYes; they often talked of all these things and formed still more plans.\\n\\nAs to Cyrus Harding he was for the most part silent, and listened to\\nhis companions more often than he spoke to them. Sometimes he smiled\\nat Herbert’s ideas or Pencroft’s nonsense, but always and everywhere he\\npondered over those inexplicable facts, that strange enigma, of which\\nthe secret still escaped him!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\nThe weather changed during the first week of March. There had been a\\nfull moon at the commencement of the month, and the heat was excessive.\\nThe atmosphere was felt to be full of electricity, and a period of some\\nlength of tempestuous weather was to be feared.\\n\\nIndeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew from the\\neast, and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House like\\nvolleys of grape-shot. The door and windows were immediately closed,\\nor everything in the rooms would have been drenched. On seeing these\\nhailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon’s egg, Pencroft’s\\nfirst thought was that his cornfield was in serious danger.\\n\\nHe directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were already\\nappearing, and by means of a great cloth, he managed to protect his\\ncrop.\\n\\nThis bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder rolled\\nwithout cessation in the depths of the sky.\\n\\nThe colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors, profited\\nby the bad weather to work at the interior of Granite House, the\\narrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day. The\\nengineer made a turning-lathe, with which he turned several articles\\nboth for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly buttons, the want of\\nwhich was greatly felt. A gunrack had been made for the firearms, which\\nwere kept with extreme care, and neither tables nor cupboards were left\\nincomplete. They sawed, they planed, they filed, they turned; and during\\nthe whole of this bad season, nothing was heard but the grinding\\nof tools or the humming of the turning-lathe which responded to the\\ngrowling of the thunder.\\n\\nMaster Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the back,\\nnear the storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good\\nlitter, which perfectly suited his taste.\\n\\n“With good old Jup there is never any quarreling,” often repeated\\nPencroft, “never any improper reply. What a servant, Neb, what a\\nservant!”\\n\\nOf course Jup was now well used to service. He brushed their clothes,\\nhe turned the spit, he waited at table, he swept the rooms, he gathered\\nwood, and he performed another admirable piece of service which\\ndelighted Pencroft--he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck\\nup the worthy sailor in his bed.\\n\\nAs to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana,\\nquadrumana or quadrupeds, it left nothing to be desired. With their life\\nin the open air, on this salubrious soil, under that temperate zone,\\nworking both with head and hands, they could not suppose that illness\\nwould ever attack them.\\n\\nAll were indeed wonderfully well. Herbert had already grown two inches\\nin the year. His figure was forming and becoming more manly, and he\\npromised to be an accomplished man, physically as well as morally.\\nBesides he improved himself during the leisure hours which manual\\noccupations left to him; he read the books found in the case; and after\\nthe practical lessons which were taught by the very necessity of their\\nposition, he found in the engineer for science, and the reporter for\\nlanguages, masters who were delighted to complete his education.\\n\\nThe tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained covered\\nwith clouds during the whole of this last summer month. The atmosphere,\\nviolently agitated by the electric commotions, could not recover its\\nformer purity, and there was almost invariably rain and fog, except for\\nthree or four fine days on which several excursions were made. About\\nthis time the female onager gave birth to a young one which belonged to\\nthe same sex as its mother, and which throve capitally. In the corral,\\nthe flock of musmons had also increased, and several lambs already\\nbleated in the sheds, to the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who had\\neach their favorite among these newcomers. An attempt was also made\\nfor the domestication of the peccaries, which succeeded well. A sty was\\nconstructed under the poultry-yard, and soon contained several young\\nones in the way to become civilized, that is to say, to become fat\\nunder Neb’s care. Master Jup, entrusted with carrying them their\\ndaily nourishment, leavings from the kitchen, etc., acquitted himself\\nconscientiously of his task. He sometimes amused himself at the expense\\nof his little pensioners by tweaking their tails; but this was mischief,\\nand not wickedness, for these little twisted tails amused him like a\\nplaything, and his instinct was that of a child. One day in this month\\nof March, Pencroft, talking to the engineer, reminded Cyrus Harding of a\\npromise which the latter had not as yet had time to fulfil.\\n\\n“You once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long\\nladders at Granite House, captain,” said he; “won’t you make it some\\nday?”\\n\\n“Nothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?”\\n\\n“Certainly, captain. After we have given ourselves necessaries, let us\\nthink a little of luxury. For us it may be luxury, if you like, but\\nfor things it is necessary. It isn’t very convenient to climb up a long\\nladder when one is heavily loaded.”\\n\\n“Well, Pencroft, we will try to please you,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“But you have no machine at your disposal.”\\n\\n“We will make one.”\\n\\n“A steam machine?”\\n\\n“No, a water machine.”\\n\\nAnd, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural force\\nat the disposal of the engineer which could be used without great\\ndifficulty. For this, it was enough to augment the flow of the little\\nstream which supplied the interior of Granite House with water. The\\nopening among the stones and grass was then increased, thus producing\\na strong fall at the bottom of the passage, the overflow from which\\nescaped by the inner well. Below this fall the engineer fixed a cylinder\\nwith paddles, which was joined on the exterior with a strong cable\\nrolled on a wheel, supporting a basket. In this way, by means of a long\\nrope reaching to the ground, which enabled them to regulate the motive\\npower, they could rise in the basket to the door of Granite House.\\n\\nIt was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first time, and\\ngave universal satisfaction. Henceforward all the loads, wood, coal,\\nprovisions, and even the settlers themselves, were hoisted by this\\nsimple system, which replaced the primitive ladder, and, as may be\\nsupposed, no one thought of regretting the change. Top particularly was\\nenchanted with this improvement, for he had not, and never could have\\npossessed Master Jup’s skill in climbing ladders, and often it was on\\nNeb’s back, or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to\\nmake the ascent to Granite House. About this time, too, Cyrus Harding\\nattempted to manufacture glass, and he at first put the old pottery-kiln\\nto this new use. There were some difficulties to be encountered; but,\\nafter several fruitless attempts, he succeeded in setting up a glass\\nmanufactory, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert, his usual assistants, did\\nnot leave for several days. As to the substances used in the composition\\nof glass, they are simply sand, chalk, and soda, either carbonate or\\nsulphate. Now the beach supplied sand, lime supplied chalk, sea-weeds\\nsupplied soda, pyrites supplied sulphuric acid, and the ground supplied\\ncoal to heat the kiln to the wished-for temperature. Cyrus Harding thus\\nsoon had everything ready for setting to work.\\n\\nThe tool, the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty, was\\nthe pipe of the glass-maker, an iron tube, five or six feet long, which\\ncollects on one end the material in a state of fusion. But by means of\\na long, thin piece of iron rolled up like the barrel of a gun, Pencroft\\nsucceeded in making a tube soon ready for use.\\n\\nOn the 28th of March the tube was heated. A hundred parts of sand,\\nthirty-five of chalk, forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with two or three\\nparts of powdered coal, composed the substance, which was placed in\\ncrucibles. When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a\\nliquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding collected with the tube\\na quantity of the paste: he turned it about on a metal plate, previously\\narranged, so as to give it a form suitable for blowing, then he passed\\nthe tube to Herbert, telling him to blow at the other extremity.\\n\\nAnd Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well into the\\ntube-taking care to twirl it round at the same time--that his breath\\ndilated the glassy mass. Other quantities of the substance in a state\\nof fusion were added to the first, and in a short time the result was a\\nbubble which measured a foot in diameter. Harding then took the tube\\nout of Herbert’s hands, and, giving it a pendulous motion, he ended by\\nlengthening the malleable bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic shape.\\n\\nThe blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two\\nhemispheric caps, which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron\\ndipped in cold water; then, by the same proceeding, this cylinder was\\ncut lengthways, and after having been rendered malleable by a second\\nheating, it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller.\\n\\nThe first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to perform this\\noperation fifty times to have fifty panes. The windows at Granite House\\nwere soon furnished with panes; not very white, perhaps, but still\\nsufficiently transparent.\\n\\nAs to bottles and tumblers, that was only play. They were satisfied with\\nthem, besides, just as they came from the end of the tube. Pencroft had\\nasked to be allowed to “blow” in his turn, and it was great fun for\\nhim; but he blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous\\nshapes, which he admired immensely.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered the forest\\nof the Far West, on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as usual, the\\nlad was asking a thousand questions of the engineer, who answered them\\nheartily. Now, as Harding was not a sportsman, and as, on the other\\nside, Herbert was talking chemistry and natural philosophy, numbers of\\nkangaroos, capybaras, and agouties came within range, which, however,\\nescaped the lad’s gun; the consequence was that the day was already\\nadvanced, and the two hunters were in danger of having made a\\nuseless excursion, when Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy,\\nexclaimed,--\\n\\n“Oh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?” and he pointed to a shrub,\\nrather than a tree, for it was composed of a single stem, covered with a\\nscaly bark, which bore leaves streaked with little parallel veins.\\n\\n“And what is this tree which resembles a little palm?” asked Harding.\\n\\n“It is a ‘cycas revoluta,’ of which I have a picture in our dictionary\\nof Natural History!” said Herbert.\\n\\n“But I can’t see any fruit on this shrub!” observed his companion.\\n\\n“No, captain,” replied Herbert; “but its stem contains a flour with\\nwhich nature has provided us all ready ground.”\\n\\n“It is, then, the bread-tree?”\\n\\n“Yes, the bread-tree.”\\n\\n“Well, my boy,” replied the engineer, “this is a valuable discovery,\\nsince our wheat harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you are not\\nmistaken!”\\n\\nHerbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which was\\ncomposed of a glandulous tissue, containing a quantity of floury pith,\\ntraversed with woody fiber, separated by rings of the same substance,\\narranged concentrically. With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous\\njuice of disagreeable flavor, but which it would be easy to get rid of\\nby pressure. This cellular substance was regular flour of a superior\\nquality, extremely nourishing; its exportation was formerly forbidden by\\nthe Japanese laws.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of the Far\\nWest where the cycas grew, took their bearings, and returned to Granite\\nHouse, where they made known their discovery.\\n\\nThe next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to Granite\\nHouse with an ample supply of cycas stems. The engineer constructed a\\npress, with which to extract the mucilaginous juice mingled with the\\nfecula, and he obtained a large quantity of flour, which Neb soon\\ntransformed into cakes and puddings. This was not quite real wheaten\\nbread, but it was very like it.\\n\\nNow, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished\\ndaily the milk necessary to the colony. The cart, or rather a sort of\\nlight carriole which had replaced it, made frequent journeys to the\\ncorral, and when it was Pencroft’s turn to go he took Jup, and let him\\ndrive, and Jup, cracking his whip, acquitted himself with his customary\\nintelligence.\\n\\nEverything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House, and\\ncertainly the settlers, if it had not been that they were so far from\\ntheir native land, had no reason to complain. They were so well suited\\nto this life, and were, besides, so accustomed to the island, that they\\ncould not have left its hospitable soil without regret!\\n\\nAnd yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the heart of\\nman, that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island, the\\ncolonists would have made signals, would have attracted her attention,\\nand would have departed!\\n\\nIt was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and his\\ncompanions sanctified by rest and prayer. The day was fine, such as an\\nOctober day in the Northern Hemisphere might be.\\n\\nAll, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the veranda\\non the edge of Prospect Heights, and they were watching the\\ndarkness creeping up from the horizon. Some cups of the infusion of\\nelder-berries, which took the place of coffee, had been served by Neb.\\nThey were speaking of the island and of its isolated situation in the\\nPacific, which led Gideon Spilett to say,--\\n\\n“My dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant found in\\nthe case, again taken the position of our island?”\\n\\n“No,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“But it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument,\\nwhich is more perfect than that which you before used.”\\n\\n“What is the good?” said Pencroft. “The island is quite comfortable\\nwhere it is!”\\n\\n“Well, who knows,” returned the reporter, “who knows but that we may be\\nmuch nearer inhabited land than we think?”\\n\\n“We shall know to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and if it had not\\nbeen for the occupations which left me no leisure, we should have known\\nit already.”\\n\\n“Good!” said Pencroft. “The captain is too good an observer to be\\nmistaken, and, if it has not moved from its place, the island is just\\nwhere he put it.”\\n\\n“We shall see.”\\n\\nOn the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the engineer made\\nthe necessary observations to verify the position which he had\\nalready obtained, and this was the result of his operation. His first\\nobservation had given him the situation of Lincoln Island,--\\n\\n\\nIn west longitude: from 150deg. to 155deg.;\\n\\nIn south latitude: from 30deg. to 35deg.\\n\\n\\nThe second gave exactly:\\n\\n\\nIn longitude: 150deg. 30’\\n\\nIn south latitude: 34deg. 57’\\n\\nSo then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus\\nHarding had operated with so much skill that his error did not exceed\\nfive degrees.\\n\\n“Now,” said Gideon Spilett, “since we possess an atlas as well as a\\nsextant, let us see, my dear Cyrus, the exact position which Lincoln\\nIsland occupies in the Pacific.”\\n\\nHerbert fetched the atlas, and the map of the Pacific was opened, and\\nthe engineer, compass in hand, prepared to determine their position.\\n\\nSuddenly the compasses stopped, and he exclaimed,\\n\\n“But an island exists in this part of the Pacific already!”\\n\\n“An island?” cried Pencroft.\\n\\n“Tabor Island.”\\n\\n“An important island?”\\n\\n“No, an islet lost in the Pacific, and which perhaps has never been\\nvisited.”\\n\\n“Well, we will visit it,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“We?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain. We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to\\nsteer her. At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?”\\n\\n“About a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast,” replied Harding.\\n\\n“A hundred and fifty miles! And what’s that?” returned Pencroft. “In\\nforty-eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!”\\n\\nAnd, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed\\nin time to be launched towards the month of next October, on the return\\nof the fine season.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\nWhen Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace till it\\nwas executed. Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a boat of a\\ncertain size was necessary for this voyage, he determined to build one.\\n\\nWhat wood should he employ? Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the\\nisland? They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but which\\nstands water as well as the elm.\\n\\nThese details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season would\\nnot return before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft should work\\nalone at the boat. Gideon Spilett and Herbert were to continue to\\nhunt, and neither Neb nor Master Jup, his assistant, were to leave the\\ndomestic duties which had devolved upon them.\\n\\nDirectly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of their\\nbranches, and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have been able\\nto do it. A week after, in the recess between the Chimneys and the\\ncliff, a dockyard was prepared, and a keel five-and-thirty feet long,\\nfurnished with a stern-post at the stern and a stem at the bows, lay\\nalong the sand.\\n\\nCyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade. He knew as\\nmuch about ship-building as about nearly everything else, and he had\\nat first drawn the model of his ship on paper. Besides, he was ably\\nseconded by Pencroft, who, having worked for several years in a dockyard\\nin Brooklyn, knew the practical part of the trade. It was not until\\nafter careful calculation and deep thought that the timbers were laid on\\nthe keel.\\n\\nPencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his new\\nenterprise, and would not leave his work for an instant.\\n\\nA single thing had the honor of drawing him, but for one day only, from\\nhis dockyard. This was the second wheat-harvest, which was gathered in\\non the 15th of April. It was as much a success as the first, and yielded\\nthe number of grains which had been predicted.\\n\\n“Five bushels, captain,” said Pencroft, after having scrupulously\\nmeasured his treasure.\\n\\n“Five bushels,” replied the engineer; “and a hundred and thirty thousand\\ngrains a bushel will make six hundred and fifty thousand grains.”\\n\\n“Well, we will sow them all this time,” said the sailor, “except a\\nlittle in reserve.”\\n\\n“Yes, Pencroft, and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield, we\\nshall have four thousand bushels.”\\n\\n“And shall we eat bread?”\\n\\n“We shall eat bread.”\\n\\n“But we must have a mill.\\n\\n“We will make one.”\\n\\nThe third corn-field was very much larger than the two first, and the\\nsoil, prepared with extreme care, received the precious seed. That done,\\nPencroft returned to his work.\\n\\nDuring this time Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood, and\\nthey ventured deep into the still unknown parts of the Far West, their\\nguns loaded with ball, ready for any dangerous emergency. It was a vast\\nthicket of magnificent trees, crowded together as if pressed for room.\\nThe exploration of these dense masses of wood was difficult in\\nthe extreme, and the reporter never ventured there without the\\npocket-compass, for the sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage\\nand it would have been very difficult for them to retrace their way.\\nIt naturally happened that game was more rare in those situations where\\nthere was hardly sufficient room to move; two or three large herbivorous\\nanimals were however killed during the last fortnight of April. These\\nwere koalas, specimens of which the settlers had already seen to the\\nnorth of the lake, and which stupidly allowed themselves to be killed\\namong the thick branches of the trees in which they took refuge. Their\\nskins were brought back to Granite House, and there, by the help of\\nsulphuric acid, they were subjected to a sort of tanning process which\\nrendered them capable of being used.\\n\\nOn the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the Far\\nWest, when the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived in\\na sort of clearing, into which the trees more sparsely scattered had\\npermitted a few rays to penetrate. Gideon Spilett was at first surprised\\nat the odor which exhaled from certain plants with straight stalks,\\nround and branchy, bearing grape-like clusters of flowers and very small\\nberries. The reporter broke off one or two of these stalks and returned\\nto the lad, to whom he said,--\\n\\n“What can this be, Herbert?”\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert, “this is a treasure which will secure\\nyou Pencroft’s gratitude forever.”\\n\\n“Is it tobacco?”\\n\\n“Yes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none the less\\ntobacco!”\\n\\n“Oh, good old Pencroft! Won’t he be pleased! But we must not let him\\nsmoke it all, he must give us our share.”\\n\\n“Ah! an idea occurs to me, Mr. Spilett,” replied Herbert. “Don’t let us\\nsay anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves, and one fine\\nday we will present him with a pipe already filled!”\\n\\n“All right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will have\\nnothing left to wish for in this world.”\\n\\nThe reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious plant, and\\nthen returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it in with as much\\nprecaution as if Pencroft had been the most vigilant and severe of\\ncustom-house officers.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor\\nsuspected nothing during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long,\\nwhich was required in order to dry the small leaves, chop them up, and\\nsubject them to a certain torrefaction on hot stones. This took two\\nmonths; but all these manipulations were successfully carried on unknown\\nto Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his boat, he only\\nreturned to Granite House at the hour of rest.\\n\\nFor some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three miles\\nout in the open sea swimming around Lincoln Island. This was a whale\\nof the largest size, which apparently belonged to the southern species,\\ncalled the “Cape Whale.”\\n\\n“What a lucky chance it would be if we could capture it!” cried the\\nsailor. “Ah! if we only had a proper boat and a good harpoon, I would\\nsay ‘After the beast,’ for he would be well worth the trouble of\\ncatching!”\\n\\n“Well, Pencroft,” observed Harding, “I should much like to watch you\\nhandling a harpoon. It would be very interesting.”\\n\\n“I am astonished,” said the reporter, “to see a whale in this\\ncomparatively high latitude.”\\n\\n“Why so, Mr. Spilett?” replied Herbert. “We are exactly in that part of\\nthe Pacific which English and American whalemen call the whale field,\\nand it is here, between New Zealand and South America, that the whales\\nof the Southern Hemisphere are met with in the greatest numbers.”\\n\\nAnd Pencroft returned to his work, not without uttering a sigh of\\nregret, for every sailor is a born fisherman, and if the pleasure of\\nfishing is in exact proportion to the size of the animal, one can judge\\nhow a whaler feels in sight of a whale. And if this had only been for\\npleasure! But they could not help feeling how valuable such a prize\\nwould have been to the colony, for the oil, fat, and bones would have\\nbeen put to many uses.\\n\\nNow it happened that this whale appeared to have no wish to leave the\\nwaters of the island. Therefore, whether from the windows of Granite\\nHouse, or from Prospect Heights, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, when they\\nwere not hunting, or Neb, unless presiding over his fires, never left\\nthe telescope, but watched all the animal’s movements. The cetacean,\\nhaving entered far into Union Bay, made rapid furrows across it from\\nMandible Cape to Claw Cape, propelled by its enormously powerful flukes,\\non which it supported itself, and making its way through the water\\nat the rate little short of twelve knots. Sometimes also it\\napproached so near to the island that it could be clearly distinguished.\\nIt was the southern whale, which is completely black, the head being\\nmore depressed than that of the northern whale.\\n\\nThey could also see it throwing up from its air-holes to a great\\nheight a cloud of vapor, or of water, for, strange as it may appear,\\nnaturalists and whalers are not agreed on this subject. Is it air or is\\nit water which is thus driven out? It is generally admitted to be vapor,\\nwhich, condensing suddenly by contact with the cold air, falls again as\\nrain.\\n\\nHowever, the presence of this mammifer preoccupied the colonists. It\\nirritated Pencroft especially, as he could think of nothing else while\\nat work. He ended by longing for it, like a child for a thing which it\\nhas been denied. At night he talked about it in his sleep, and certainly\\nif he had had the means of attacking it, if the sloop had been in a fit\\nstate to put to sea, he would not have hesitated to set out in pursuit.\\n\\nBut what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did for them,\\nand on the 3rd of May shouts from Neb, who had stationed himself at the\\nkitchen window, announced that the whale was stranded on the beach of\\nthe island.\\n\\nHerbert and Gideon Spilett, who were just about to set out hunting,\\nleft their guns, Pencroft threw down his ax, and Harding and Neb joining\\ntheir companions, all rushed towards the scene of action.\\n\\nThe stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point, three miles\\nfrom Granite House, and at high tide. It was therefore probable that the\\ncetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily; at any rate it\\nwas best to hasten, so as to cut off its retreat if necessary. They ran\\nwith pick-axes and iron-tipped poles in their hands, passed over the\\nMercy bridge, descended the right bank of the river, along the beach,\\nand in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous\\nanimal, above which flocks of birds already hovered.\\n\\n“What a monster!” cried Neb.\\n\\nAnd the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale, eighty\\nfeet long, a giant of the species, probably not weighing less than a\\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds!\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor attempt by\\nstruggling to regain the water while the tide was still high.\\n\\nIt was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left side.\\n\\n“There are whalers in these quarters, then?” said Gideon Spilett\\ndirectly.\\n\\n“Oh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn’t prove anything!” replied Pencroft.\\n“Whales have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in\\nthe side, and this one might even have been struck in the north of the\\nAtlantic and come to die in the south of the Pacific, and it would be\\nnothing astonishing.”\\n\\nPencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal’s side, read this\\ninscription on it:\\n\\n\\n           MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD\\n\\n\\n“A vessel from the Vineyard! A ship from my country!” he cried. “The\\n‘Maria Stella!’ A fine whaler, ‘pon my word; I know her well! Oh, my\\nfriends, a vessel from the Vineyard!--a whaler from the Vineyard!”\\n\\nAnd the sailor brandishing the harpoon, repeated, not without emotion,\\nthe name which he loved so well--the name of his birthplace.\\n\\nBut as it could not be expected that the “Maria Stella” would come to\\nreclaim the animal harpooned by her, they resolved to begin cutting it\\nup before decomposition should commence. The birds, who had watched\\nthis rich prey for several days, had determined to take possession of it\\nwithout further delay, and it was necessary to drive them off by firing\\nat them repeatedly.\\n\\nThe whale was a female, and a large quantity of milk was taken from it,\\nwhich, according to the opinion of the naturalist Duffenbach, might pass\\nfor cow’s milk, and, indeed, it differs from it neither in taste, color,\\nnor density.\\n\\nPencroft had formerly served on board a whaling-ship, and he could\\nmethodically direct the operation of cutting up, a sufficiently\\ndisagreeable operation lasting three days, but from which the settlers\\ndid not flinch, not even Gideon Spilett, who, as the sailor said, would\\nend by making a “real good castaway.”\\n\\nThe blubber, cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness,\\nthen divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each,\\nwas melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot, for they did\\nnot wish to taint the environs of Granite House, and in this fusion it\\nlost nearly a third of its weight.\\n\\nBut there was an immense quantity of it; the tongue alone yielded six\\nthousand pounds of oil, and the lower lip four thousand. Then, besides\\nthe fat, which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and\\nglycerine, there were still the bones, for which a use could doubtless\\nbe found, although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at\\nGranite House. The upper part of the mouth of the cetacean was, indeed,\\nprovided on both sides with eight hundred horny blades, very elastic,\\nof a fibrous texture, and fringed at the edge like great combs, at which\\nthe teeth, six feet long, served to retain the thousands of animalculae,\\nlittle fish, and molluscs, on which the whale fed.\\n\\nThe operation finished, to the great satisfaction of the operators, the\\nremains of the animal were left to the birds, who would soon make every\\nvestige of it disappear, and their usual daily occupations were resumed\\nby the inmates of Granite House.\\n\\nHowever, before returning to the dockyard, Cyrus Harding conceived\\nthe idea of fabricating certain machines, which greatly excited the\\ncuriosity of his companions. He took a dozen of the whale’s bones, cut\\nthem into six equal parts, and sharpened their ends.\\n\\n“This machine is not my own invention, and it is frequently employed\\nby the Aleutian hunters in Russian America. You see these bones, my\\nfriends; well, when it freezes, I will bend them, and then wet them\\nwith water till they are entirely covered with ice, which will keep them\\nbent, and I will strew them on the snow, having previously covered them\\nwith fat. Now, what will happen if a hungry animal swallows one of these\\nbaits? Why, the heat of his stomach will melt the ice, and the bone,\\nspringing straight, will pierce him with its sharp points.”\\n\\n“Well! I do call that ingenious!” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“And it will spare the powder and shot,” rejoined Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“That will be better than traps!” added Neb.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the boat-building progressed, and towards the end of\\nthe month half the planking was completed. It could already be seen that\\nher shape was excellent, and that she would sail well.\\n\\nPencroft worked with unparalleled ardor, and only a sturdy frame could\\nhave borne such fatigue; but his companions were preparing in secret a\\nreward for his labors, and on the 31st of May he was to meet with one of\\nthe greatest joys of his life.\\n\\nOn that day, after dinner, just as he was about to leave the table,\\nPencroft felt a hand on his shoulder.\\n\\nIt was the hand of Gideon Spilett, who said,--\\n\\n“One moment, Master Pencroft, you mustn’t sneak off like that! You’ve\\nforgotten your dessert.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “I am going back to my\\nwork.”\\n\\n“Well, a cup of coffee, my friend?”\\n\\n“Nothing more.”\\n\\n“A pipe, then?”\\n\\nPencroft jumped up, and his great good-natured face grew pale when he\\nsaw the reporter presenting him with a ready-filled pipe, and Herbert\\nwith a glowing coal.\\n\\nThe sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word; so,\\nseizing the pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the coal,\\nhe drew five or six great whiffs. A fragrant blue cloud soon arose, and\\nfrom its depths a voice was heard repeating excitedly,--\\n\\n“Tobacco! real tobacco!”\\n\\n“Yes, Pencroft,” returned Cyrus Harding, “and very good tobacco too!”\\n\\n“O, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!” cried the sailor.\\n“Nothing more is now wanting to our island.”\\n\\nAnd Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked.\\n\\n“And who made this discovery?” he asked at length. “You, Herbert, no\\ndoubt?”\\n\\n“No, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett.”\\n\\n“Mr. Spilett!” exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and clasping\\nhim to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never felt anything\\nlike it before.\\n\\n“Oh Pencroft,” said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, “a truce for\\none moment. You must share your gratitude with Herbert, who recognized\\nthe plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with Neb, who took a great\\ndeal of trouble to keep our secret.”\\n\\n“Well, my friends, I will repay you some day,” replied the sailor. “Now\\nwe are friends for life.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\nWinter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of the\\nnorthern zones, and the great business was the making of warm and solid\\nclothing.\\n\\nThe musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and this\\nprecious textile material was now to be transformed into stuff.\\n\\nOf course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders,\\ncombers, polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor self-acting\\nmachine to spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was obliged to proceed\\nin a simpler way, so as to do without spinning and weaving. And indeed\\nhe proposed to make use of the property which the filaments of wool\\npossess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together, and of\\nmanufacturing by this simple process the material called felt. This felt\\ncould then be obtained by a simple operation which, if it diminished\\nthe flexibility of the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in\\nproportion. Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very\\nshort hairs, and was in a good condition to be felted.\\n\\nThe engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who was once\\nmore obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary operations,\\nthe subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance\\nwith which it is impregnated, and which is called grease. This cleaning\\nwas done in vats filled with water, which was maintained at the\\ntemperature of seventy degrees, and in which the wool was soaked for\\nfour-and-twenty hours; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda,\\nand, when sufficiently dried by pressure, it was in a state to be\\ncompressed, that is to say, to produce a solid material, rough, no\\ndoubt, and such as would have no value in a manufacturing center of\\nEurope or America, but which would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln\\nIsland markets.\\n\\nThis sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times,\\nand, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process\\nwhich Harding was now about to employ. Where Harding’s engineering\\nqualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine\\nfor pressing the wool; for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit\\nthe mechanical force, hitherto unused, which the waterfall on the beach\\npossessed to move a fulling-mill.\\n\\nNothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in troughs, and\\nupon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was the machine in\\nquestion, and such it had been for centuries until the time when the\\nmallets were replaced by cylinders of compression, and the material was\\nno longer subjected to beating, but to regular rolling.\\n\\nThe operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete success.\\nThe wool, previously impregnated with a solution of soap, intended on\\nthe one hand to facilitate the interlacing, the compression, and the\\nsoftening of the wool, and on the other to prevent its diminution by\\nthe beating, issued from the mill in the shape of thick felt cloth. The\\nroughnesses with which the staple of wool is naturally filled were so\\nthoroughly entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed\\nequally suitable either for garments or bedclothes. It was certainly\\nneither merino, muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor\\nflannel. It was “Lincolnian felt,” and Lincoln Island possessed yet\\nanother manufacture. The colonists had now warm garments and thick\\nbedclothes, and they could without fear await the approach of the winter\\nof 1866-67.\\n\\nThe severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to his\\ngreat regret, Pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat-building, which\\nhe hoped to finish in time for next spring.\\n\\nThe sailor’s great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor\\nIsland, although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply for\\ncuriosity’s sake, for there was evidently nothing to be found on this\\ndesert and almost arid rock. A voyage of a hundred and fifty miles in a\\ncomparatively small vessel, over unknown seas, could not but cause him\\nsome anxiety. Suppose that their vessel, once out at sea, should be\\nunable to reach Tabor Island, and could not return to Lincoln Island,\\nwhat would become of her in the midst of the Pacific, so fruitful of\\ndisasters?\\n\\nHarding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he found him\\nstrangely bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which determination he\\nhimself could give no sufficient reason.\\n\\n“Now,” said the engineer one day to him, “I must observe, my friend,\\nthat after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after\\nhaving spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged\\nto forsake it, you are the first to wish to leave it.”\\n\\n“Only to leave it for a few days,” replied Pencroft, “only for a few\\ndays, captain. Time to go and come back, and see what that islet is\\nlike!”\\n\\n“But it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island.”\\n\\n“I know that beforehand.”\\n\\n“Then why venture there?”\\n\\n“To know what is going on in Tabor Island.”\\n\\n“But nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there.”\\n\\n“Who knows?”\\n\\n“And if you are caught in a hurricane?”\\n\\n“There is no fear of that in the fine season,” replied Pencroft.\\n“But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your\\npermission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage.”\\n\\n“Pencroft,” replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor’s\\nshoulder, “if any misfortune happens to you, or to this lad, whom\\nchance has made our child, do you think we could ever cease to blame\\nourselves?”\\n\\n“Captain Harding,” replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence, “we\\nshall not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further of this\\nvoyage, when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when you have seen\\nour tight-rigged little craft, when you have observed how she behaves at\\nsea, when we sail round our island, for we will do so together--I fancy,\\nI say, that you will no longer hesitate to let me go. I don’t conceal\\nfrom you that your boat will be a masterpiece.”\\n\\n“Say ‘our’ boat, at least, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, disarmed for\\nthe moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed later on, without\\nconvincing either the sailor or the engineer.\\n\\nThe first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The corral had\\npreviously been largely supplied with stores, so that daily visits to\\nit were not requisite; but it was decided that more than a week should\\nnever be allowed to pass without someone going to it.\\n\\nTraps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding were\\ntried. The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and covered\\nwith a thick outer layer of fat, were placed on the border of the forest\\nat a spot where animals usually passed on their way to the lake.\\n\\nTo the engineer’s great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the\\nAleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a few wild\\nboars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the animals being\\nfound dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent bones.\\n\\nAn incident must here be related, not only as interesting in itself, but\\nbecause it was the first attempt made by the colonists to communicate\\nwith the rest of mankind.\\n\\nGideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into\\nthe sea a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents might perhaps\\ncarry to an inhabited coast, or to confide it to pigeons.\\n\\nBut how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or bottles could\\ncross the distance of twelve hundred miles which separated the island\\nfrom any inhabited land? It would have been pure folly.\\n\\nBut on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without\\ndifficulty, of an albatross, which a shot from Herbert’s gun had\\nslightly wounded in the foot. It was a magnificent bird, measuring ten\\nfeet from wing to wing, and which could traverse seas as wide as the\\nPacific.\\n\\nHerbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound would\\nsoon heal, and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett explained to\\nhim that they should not neglect this opportunity of attempting to\\ncommunicate by this messenger with the lands of the Pacific; for if the\\nalbatross had come from some inhabited region, there was no doubt but\\nthat it would return there so soon as it was set free.\\n\\nPerhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist sometimes\\ncame to the surface, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending\\nforth to take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures\\nof the settlers in Lincoln Island. What a success for the authorized\\nreporter of the New York Herald, and for the number which should contain\\nthe article, if it should ever reach the address of its editor, the\\nHonorable James Bennett!\\n\\nGideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was placed in a\\nstrong waterproof bag, with an earnest request to whoever might find it\\nto forward it to the office of the New York Herald. This little bag was\\nfastened to the neck of the albatross, and not to its foot, for these\\nbirds are in the habit of resting on the surface of the sea; then\\nliberty was given to this swift courier of the air, and it was not\\nwithout some emotion that the colonists watched it disappear in the\\nmisty west.\\n\\n“Where is he going to?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Towards New Zealand,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“A good voyage to you,” shouted the sailor, who himself did not expect\\nany great result from this mode of correspondence.\\n\\nWith the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of Granite House,\\nmending clothes and different occupations, among others making the sails\\nfor their vessel, which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon-case.\\n\\nDuring the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no lack of\\neither wood or coal. Cyrus Harding had established a second fireplace in\\nthe dining-room, and there the long winter evenings were spent. Talking\\nwhile they worked, reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed\\nwith profit to all.\\n\\nIt was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well lighted\\nwith candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner, elderberry\\ncoffee smoking in the cups, the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke,\\nthey could hear the storm howling without. Their comfort would have been\\ncomplete, if complete comfort could ever exist for those who are far\\nfrom their fellow-creatures, and without any means of communication with\\nthem. They often talked of their country, of the friends whom they had\\nleft, of the grandeur of the American Republic, whose influence could\\nnot but increase; and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the\\naffairs of the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals,\\nhis views, and his prognostics.\\n\\nIt chanced one day that Spilett was led to say--\\n\\n“But now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial movement\\nto which you predict a continual advance, does it not run the danger of\\nbeing sooner or later completely stopped?”\\n\\n“Stopped! And by what?”\\n\\n“By the want of coal, which may justly be called the most precious of\\nminerals.”\\n\\n“Yes, the most precious indeed,” replied the engineer; “and it would\\nseem that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the diamond,\\nwhich is simply pure carbon crystallized.”\\n\\n“You don’t mean to say, captain,” interrupted Pencroft, “that we burn\\ndiamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?”\\n\\n“No, my friend,” replied Harding.\\n\\n“However,” resumed Gideon Spilett, “you do not deny that some day the\\ncoal will be entirely consumed?”\\n\\n“Oh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred\\nthousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of\\nhundredweights have not nearly exhausted them.”\\n\\n“With the increasing consumption of coal,” replied Gideon Spilett, “it\\ncan be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two\\nhundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled.”\\n\\n“Doubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon worked more\\nthoroughly with new machines, the American and Australian mines will for\\na long time yet provide for the consumption in trade.”\\n\\n“For how long a time?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years.”\\n\\n“That is reassuring for us, but a bad look-out for our\\ngreat-grandchildren!” observed Pencroft.\\n\\n“They will discover something else,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“It is to be hoped so,” answered Spilett, “for without coal there would\\nbe no machinery, and without machinery there would be no railways, no\\nsteamers, no manufactories, nothing of that which is indispensable to\\nmodern civilization!”\\n\\n“But what will they find?” asked Pencroft. “Can you guess, captain?”\\n\\n“Nearly, my friend.”\\n\\n“And what will they burn instead of coal?”\\n\\n“Water,” replied Harding.\\n\\n“Water!” cried Pencroft, “water as fuel for steamers and engines! water\\nto heat water!”\\n\\n“Yes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements,” replied Cyrus\\nHarding, “and decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which will then have\\nbecome a powerful and manageable force, for all great discoveries, by\\nsome inexplicable laws, appear to agree and become complete at the same\\ntime. Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed\\nas fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or\\ntogether, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of\\nan intensity of which coal is not capable. Some day the coalrooms of\\nsteamers and the tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored\\nwith these two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with\\nenormous calorific power. There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long\\nas the earth is inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants,\\nand there will be no want of either light or heat as long as the\\nproductions of the vegetable, mineral or animal kingdoms do not fail us.\\nI believe, then, that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall\\nheat and warm ourselves with water. Water will be the coal of the\\nfuture.”\\n\\n“I should like to see that,” observed the sailor.\\n\\n“You were born too soon, Pencroft,” returned Neb, who only took part in\\nthe discussion by these words.\\n\\nHowever, it was not Neb’s speech which interrupted the conversation, but\\nTop’s barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which\\nhad before perplexed the engineer. At the same time Top began to run\\nround the mouth of the well, which opened at the extremity of the\\ninterior passage.\\n\\n“What can Top be barking in that way for?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“And Jup be growling like that?” added Herbert.\\n\\nIn fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of agitation,\\nand, singular to say, the two animals appeared more uneasy than angry.\\n\\n“It is evident,” said Gideon Spilett, “that this well is in direct\\ncommunication with the sea, and that some marine animal comes from time\\nto time to breathe at the bottom.”\\n\\n“That’s evident,” replied the sailor, “and there can be no other\\nexplanation to give. Quiet there, Top!” added Pencroft, turning to the\\ndog, “and you, Jup, be off to your room!”\\n\\nThe ape and the dog were silent. Jup went off to bed, but Top remained\\nin the room, and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the\\nrest of the evening. There was no further talk on the subject, but the\\nincident, however, clouded the brow of the engineer.\\n\\nDuring the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and\\nfrost. The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter,\\nand its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit. But although\\nthis winter was less cold, it was more troubled by storms and squalls;\\nthe sea besides often endangered the safety of the Chimneys. At times\\nit almost seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows\\nwhich thundered against the wall of Granite House.\\n\\nWhen the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge watery\\nmasses breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but admire the\\nmagnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury. The waves\\nrebounded in dazzling foam, the beach entirely disapppearing under the\\nraging flood, and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself, the\\nspray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet.\\n\\nDuring these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out,\\nowing to the frequently falling trees; however, the colonists never\\nallowed a week to pass without having paid a visit to the corral.\\nHappily, this enclosure, sheltered by the southeastern spur of Mount\\nFranklin, did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes,\\nwhich spared its trees, sheds, and palisades; but the poultry-yard on\\nProspect Heights, being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the\\neast, suffered considerable damage. The pigeon-house was twice unroofed\\nand the paling blown down. All this required to be remade more solidly\\nthan before, for, as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in\\none of the most dangerous parts of the Pacific. It really appeared as if\\nit formed the central point of vast cyclones, which beat it perpetually\\nas the whip does the top, only here it was the top which was motionless\\nand the whip which moved. During the first week of the month of August\\nthe weather became more moderate, and the atmosphere recovered the calm\\nwhich it appeared to have lost forever. With the calm the cold again\\nbecame intense, and the thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit,\\nbelow zero.\\n\\nOn the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several\\ndays was made into the southeastern part of the island, towards Tadorn\\nMarsh. The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their\\nwinter quarters there. Wild duck, snipe, teal and grebe abounded there,\\nand it was agreed that a day should be devoted to an expedition against\\nthese birds.\\n\\nNot only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part\\nin this excursion. Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some work as an excuse,\\ndid not join them, but remained at Granite House.\\n\\nThe hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order to\\nreach the marsh, after having promised to be back by the evening. Top\\nand Jup accompanied them. As soon as they had passed over the Mercy\\nBridge, the engineer raised it and returned, intending to put into\\nexecution a project for the performance of which he wished to be alone.\\n\\nNow this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the mouth\\nof which was on a level with the passage of Granite House, and which\\ncommunicated with the sea, since it formerly supplied a way to the\\nwaters of the lake.\\n\\nWhy did Top so often run round this opening? Why did he utter such\\nstrange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this\\nwell? Why did Jup join Top in a sort of common anxiety? Had this well\\nbranches besides the communication with the sea? Did it spread towards\\nother parts of the island? This is what Cyrus Harding wished to know. He\\nhad resolved, therefore, to attempt the exploration of the well during\\nthe absence of his companions, and an opportunity for doing so had now\\npresented itself.\\n\\nIt was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing the rope\\nladder which had not been used since the establishment of the lift. The\\nengineer drew the ladder to the hole, the diameter of which measured\\nnearly six feet, and allowed it to unroll itself after having securely\\nfastened its upper extremity. Then, having lighted a lantern, taken a\\nrevolver, and placed a cutlass in his belt, he began the descent.\\n\\nThe sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out here and\\nthere, and by means of these points it would have been quite possible\\nfor an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well.\\n\\nThe engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined these\\npoints by the light of his lantern, he could find no impression, no\\nfracture which could give any reason to suppose that they had either\\nrecently or at any former time been used as a staircase. Cyrus Harding\\ndescended deeper, throwing the light of his lantern on all sides.\\n\\nHe saw nothing suspicious.\\n\\nWhen the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the water,\\nwhich was then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in any other\\npart of the well, did any passage open, which could lead to the interior\\nof the cliff. The wall which Harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass\\nsounded solid. It was compact granite, through which no living being\\ncould force a way. To arrive at the bottom of the well and then climb\\nup to its mouth it was necessary to pass through the channel under the\\nrocky subsoil of the beach, which placed it in communication with the\\nsea, and this was only possible for marine animals. As to the question\\nof knowing where this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at\\nwhat depth beneath the water, it could not be answered.\\n\\nThen Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew up the\\nladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the\\ndiningroom, saying to himself,--\\n\\n“I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\nIn the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and\\nbeing literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men\\ncould possibly carry. Top wore a necklace of teal and Jup wreaths of\\nsnipe round his body.\\n\\n“Here, master,” cried Neb; “here’s something to employ our time!\\nPreserved and made into pies we shall have a welcome store! But I must\\nhave some one to help me. I count on you, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“No, Neb,” replied the sailor; “I have the rigging of the vessel to\\nfinish and to look after, and you will have to do without me.”\\n\\n“And you, Mr. Herbert?”\\n\\n“I must go to the corral to-morrow, Neb,” replied the lad.\\n\\n“It will be you then, Mr. Spilett, who will help me?”\\n\\n“To oblige you, Neb, I will,” replied the reporter; “but I warn you that\\nif you disclose your recipes to me, I shall publish them.”\\n\\n“Whenever you like, Mr. Spilett,” replied Neb; “whenever you like.”\\n\\nAnd so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb’s assistant and was\\ninstalled in his culinary laboratory. The engineer had previously made\\nknown to him the result of the exploration which he had made the day\\nbefore, and on this point the reporter shared Harding’s opinion, that\\nalthough he had found nothing, a secret still remained to be discovered!\\n\\nThe frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave\\nGranite House unless to look after the poultry-yard. The dwelling\\nwas filled with appetizing odors, which were emitted from the learned\\nmanipulation of Neb and the reporter. But all the results of the chase\\nwere not made into preserved provisions; and as the game kept perfectly\\nin the intense cold, wild duck and other fowl were eaten fresh, and\\ndeclared superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world.\\n\\nDuring this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the\\nsailmaker’s needle with much skill, worked with such energy that the\\nsails of the vessel were finished. There was no want of cordage. Thanks\\nto the rigging which had been discovered with the case of the balloon,\\nthe ropes and cables from the net were all of good quality, and the\\nsailor turned them all to account. To the sails were attached strong\\nbolt ropes, and there still remained enough from which to make the\\nhalyards, shrouds, and sheets, etc. The blocks were manufactured by\\nCyrus Harding under Pencroft’s directions by means of the turning lathe.\\nIt therefore happened that the rigging was entirely prepared before the\\nvessel was finished. Pencroft also manufactured a flag, that flag so\\ndear to every true American, containing the stars and stripes of their\\nglorious Union. The colors for it were supplied from certain plants\\nused in dyeing, and which were very abundant in the island; only to the\\nthirty-seven stars, representing the thirty-seven States of the Union,\\nwhich shine on the American flag, the sailor added a thirty-eighth, the\\nstar of “the State of Lincoln,” for he considered his island as already\\nunited to the great republic. “And,” said he, “it is so already in\\nheart, if not in deed!”\\n\\nIn the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of Granite\\nHouse, and the settlers saluted it with three cheers.\\n\\nThe cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this\\nsecond winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when on the\\nnight of the 11th of August, the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced\\nwith complete destruction.\\n\\nAfter a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when towards four\\no’clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by Top’s barking.\\n\\nThe dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well, but at\\nthe threshold of the door, at which he was scratching as if he wished to\\nburst it open. Jup was also uttering piercing cries.\\n\\n“Hello, Top!” cried Neb, who was the first awake. But the dog continued\\nto bark more furiously than ever.\\n\\n“What’s the matter now?” asked Harding.\\n\\nAnd all dressing in haste rushed to the windows, which they opened.\\n\\nBeneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the\\ndim light. The settlers could see nothing, but they heard a singular\\nyelping noise away in the darkness. It was evident that the beach had\\nbeen invaded by a number of animals which could not be seen.\\n\\n“What are they?” cried Pencroft.\\n\\n“Wolves, jaguars, or apes?” replied Neb.\\n\\n“They have nearly reached the plateau,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“And our poultry-yard,” exclaimed Herbert, “and our garden!”\\n\\n“Where can they have crossed?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“They must have crossed the bridge on the shore,” replied the engineer,\\n“which one of us must have forgotten to close.”\\n\\n“True,” said Spilett, “I remember having left it open.”\\n\\n“A fine job you have made of it, Mr. Spilett,” cried the sailor.\\n\\n“What is done cannot be undone,” replied Cyrus Harding. “We must consult\\nwhat it will now be best to do.”\\n\\nSuch were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged between\\nHarding and his companions. It was certain that the bridge had been\\ncrossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and that whatever\\nthey might be they could by ascending the left bank of the Mercy reach\\nProspect Heights. They must therefore be advanced against quickly and\\nfought with if necessary.\\n\\n“But what are these beasts?” was asked a second time, as the yelpings\\nwere again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made Herbert\\nstart, and he remembered having heard them before during his first visit\\nto the sources of the Red Creek.\\n\\n“They are colpeo foxes!” he exclaimed.\\n\\n“Forward!” shouted the sailor.\\n\\nAnd all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and revolvers, threw\\nthemselves into the lift and soon set foot on the shore.\\n\\nColpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and irritated by\\nhunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to throw themselves\\ninto the midst of the troop, and their first shots vividly lighting up\\nthe darkness made their assailants draw back.\\n\\nThe chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the\\nplateau, for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been at\\ntheir mercy, and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would inevitably\\nbe the result, especially with regard to the corn-field. But as the\\ninvasion of the plateau could only be made by the left bank of the\\nMercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank\\nbetween the river and the cliff of granite.\\n\\nThis was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding’s orders, they reached the\\nspot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed fiercely through\\nthe gloom. Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft and Neb posted\\nthemselves in impregnable line. Top, his formidable jaws open, preceded\\nthe colonists, and he was followed by Jup, armed with a knotty cudgel,\\nwhich he brandished like a club.\\n\\nThe night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from the\\nrevolvers as each person fired that they could see their assailants, who\\nwere at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes were glowing like hot\\ncoals.\\n\\n“They must not pass!” shouted Pencroft.\\n\\n“They shall not pass!” returned the engineer.\\n\\nBut if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it.\\nThose in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was an\\nincessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets. Several colpeos already\\nlay dead on the ground, but their number did not appear to diminish,\\nand it might have been supposed that reinforcements were continually\\narriving over the bridge.\\n\\nThe colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not without\\nreceiving some wounds, though happily very slight ones. Herbert had,\\nwith a shot from his revolver, rescued Neb, on whose back a colpeo had\\nsprung like a tiger cat. Top fought with actual fury, flying at the\\nthroats of the foxes and strangling them instantaneously. Jup wielded\\nhis weapon valiantly, and it was in vain that they endeavored to keep\\nhim in the rear. Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to\\npierce the obscurity, he was always in the thick of the fight uttering\\nfrom time to time--a sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of\\ngreat rejoicing.\\n\\nAt one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a revolver\\nhe was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with whom he was\\ncoping with great coolness.\\n\\nHowever, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the side\\nof the settlers, but not until they had fought for two long hours! The\\nfirst signs of the approach of day doubtless determined the retreat of\\ntheir assailants, who scampered away towards the North, passing over the\\nbridge, which Neb ran immediately to raise. When day had sufficiently\\nlighted up the field of battle, the settlers counted as many as fifty\\ndead bodies scattered about on the shore.\\n\\n“And Jup!” cried Pencroft; “where is Jup?” Jup had disappeared. His\\nfriend Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply to his\\nfriend’s call.\\n\\nEveryone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found\\namong the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the\\nsnow with their blood. Jup was found in the midst of a heap of colpeos\\nwhose broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that they had to do with the\\nterrible club of the intrepid animal.\\n\\nPoor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel, but\\ndeprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and his chest\\nwas covered with severe wounds.\\n\\n“He is living,” cried Neb, who was bending over him.\\n\\n“And we will save him,” replied the sailor. “We will nurse him as if he\\nwas one of ourselves.”\\n\\nIt appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on Pencroft’s\\nshoulder as if to thank him. The sailor was wounded himself, but his\\nwound was insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to\\ntheir firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants\\nat a distance. It was therefore only the orang whose condition was\\nserious.\\n\\nJup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and only a\\nslight moan now and then escaped his lips. He was gently drawn up to\\nGranite House. There he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the\\nbeds, and his wounds were bathed with the greatest care. It did not\\nappear that any vital part had been reached, but Jup was very weak from\\nloss of blood, and a high fever soon set in after his wounds had been\\ndressed. He was laid down, strict diet was imposed, “just like a real\\nperson,” as Neb said, and they made him swallow several cups of\\na cooling drink, for which the ingredients were supplied from the\\nvegetable medicine chest of Granite House. Jup was at first restless,\\nbut his breathing gradually became more regular, and he was left\\nsleeping quietly. From time to time Top, walking on tip-toe, as one\\nmight say, came to visit his friend, and seemed to approve of all the\\ncare that had been taken of him. One of Jup’s hands hung over the side\\nof his bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air.\\n\\nThey employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to the\\nforest of the Far West, and there buried deep.\\n\\nThis attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was a\\nlesson to the settlers, who from this time never went to bed until one\\nof their number had made sure that all the bridges were raised, and that\\nno invasion was possible.\\n\\nHowever, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for several\\ndays, began to recover. His constitution brought him through, the fever\\ngradually subsided, and Gideon Spilett, who was a bit of a doctor,\\npronounced him quite out of danger. On the 16th of August, Jup began to\\neat. Neb made him nice little sweet dishes, which the invalid devoured\\nwith great relish, for if he had a pet failing it was that of being\\nsomewhat of a gourmand, and Neb had never done anything to cure him of\\nthis fault.\\n\\n“What would you have?” said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes\\nexpostulated with him for spoiling the ape. “Poor Jup has no other\\npleasure than that of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able to\\nreward his services in this way!”\\n\\nTen days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master Jup\\narose. His wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would not\\nbe long in regaining his usual strength and agility. Like all\\nconvalescents, he was tremendously hungry, and the reporter allowed him\\nto eat as much as he liked, for he trusted to that instinct, which\\nis too often wanting in reasoning beings, to keep the orang from any\\nexcess. Neb was delighted to see his pupil’s appetite returning.\\n\\n“Eat away, my Jup,” said he, “and don’t spare anything; you have shed\\nyour blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you strong\\nagain!”\\n\\nOn the 25th of August Neb’s voice was heard calling to his companions.\\n\\n“Captain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!”\\n\\nThe colonists, who were together in the dining-room, rose at Neb’s call,\\nwho was then in Jup’s room.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“Look,” replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they see?\\nMaster Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged like a Turk\\nat the entrance to Granite House!\\n\\n“My pipe,” cried Pencroft. “He has taken my pipe! Hello, my honest Jup,\\nI make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke away!”\\n\\nAnd Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him\\ngreat satisfaction. Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this\\nincident, and he cited several examples of tame apes, to whom the use of\\ntobacco had become quite familiar.\\n\\nBut from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor’s\\nex-pipe, which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco. He filled\\nit himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be\\nthe happiest of quadrumana. It may readily be understood that this\\nsimilarity of tastes of Jup and Pencroft served to tighten the bonds of\\nfriendship which already existed between the honest ape and the worthy\\nsailor.\\n\\n“Perhaps he is really a man,” said Pencroft sometimes to Neb. “Should\\nyou be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some day?”\\n\\n“My word, no,” replied Neb. “What astonishes me is that he hasn’t spoken\\nto us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!”\\n\\n“It would amuse me all the same,” resumed the sailor, “if some fine day\\nhe said to me, ‘Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft.’”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Neb, “what a pity he was born dumb!”\\n\\nWith the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again\\neagerly commenced. The building of the vessel advanced rapidly, she was\\nalready completely decked over, and all the inside parts of the hull\\nwere firmly united with ribs bent by means of steam, which answered all\\nthe purposes of a mold.\\n\\nAs there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer to give\\na double lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the vessel.\\n\\nHarding, not knowing what the future might have in store for them,\\napproved the sailor’s idea of making the craft as strong as possible.\\nThe interior and deck of the vessel was entirely finished towards the\\n15th of September. For calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed,\\nwhich was hammered in between the planks; then these seams were covered\\nwith boiling tar, which was obtained in great abundance from the pines\\nin the forest.\\n\\nThe management of the vessel was very simple. She had from the first\\nbeen ballasted with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a bed of lime,\\ntwelve thousand pounds of which they stowed away.\\n\\nA deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was divided into\\ntwo cabins; two benches extended along them and served also as lockers.\\nThe foot of the mast supported the partition which separated the two\\ncabins, which were reached by two hatchways let into the deck.\\n\\nPencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast. He\\nchose a straight young fir, with no knots, and which he had only to\\nsquare at the step, and round off at the top. The ironwork of the mast,\\nthe rudder and the hull had been roughly but strongly forged at the\\nChimneys. Lastly, yards, masts, boom, spars, oars, etc., were all\\nfurnished by the first week in October, and it was agreed that a trial\\ntrip should be taken round the island, so as to ascertain how the vessel\\nwould behave at sea, and how far they might depend upon her.\\n\\nDuring all this time the necessary works had not been neglected.\\nThe corral was enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had been\\nincreased by a number of young ones, who had to be housed and fed. The\\ncolonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed, the warren, the coal\\nand iron mines, and to the till then unexplored districts of the Far\\nWest forest, which abounded in game. Certain indigenous plants were\\ndiscovered, and those fit for immediate use contributed to vary the\\nvegetable stores of Granite House.\\n\\nThey were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the Cape, with\\neatable fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour.\\n\\nOn the 10th of October the vessel was launched. Pencroft was radiant\\nwith joy, the operation was perfectly successful; the boat completely\\nrigged, having been pushed on rollers to the water’s edge, was floated\\nby the rising tide, amid the cheers of the colonists, particularly of\\nPencroft, who showed no modesty on this occasion. Besides his importance\\nwas to last beyond the finishing of the vessel, since, after having\\nbuilt her, he was to command her. The grade of captain was bestowed upon\\nhim with the approbation of all. To satisfy Captain Pencroft, it was now\\nnecessary to give a name to the vessel, and, after many propositions had\\nbeen discussed, the votes were all in favor of the “Bonadventure.” As\\nsoon as the “Bonadventure” had been lifted by the rising tide, it was\\nseen that she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated.\\nHowever, the trial trip was to be made that very day, by an excursion\\noff the coast. The weather was fine, the breeze fresh, and the sea\\nsmooth, especially towards the south coast, for the wind was blowing\\nfrom the northwest.\\n\\n“All hands on board,” shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first\\nnecessary, and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in the\\nevent of their excursion being prolonged until the evening.\\n\\nCyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model of which\\nhad originated with him, although on the sailor’s advice he had altered\\nsome parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft’s confidence in her,\\nand as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to Tabor Island,\\nHarding hoped he had given it up. He would have indeed great reluctance\\nin letting two or three of his companions venture so far in so small a\\nboat, which was not of more than fifteen tons’ burden.\\n\\nAt half-past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and Herbert\\nweighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the\\nMercy. The sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag floated from the\\nmasthead, and the “Bonadventure,” steered by Pencroft, stood out to sea.\\n\\nThe wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus showed her\\nowners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a remarkably fast\\npair of heels, according to Pencroft’s mode of speaking. After having\\ndoubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the captain kept her close hauled,\\nso as to sail along the southern coast of the island, when it was found\\nshe sailed admirably within five points of the wind. All hands were\\nenchanted, they had a good vessel, which, in case of need, would be\\nof great service to them, and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the\\nvoyage promised to be charming.\\n\\nPencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across from Port\\nBalloon. The island then appeared in all its extent and under a new\\naspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw Cape to Reptile\\nEnd, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with the young foliage\\nof other trees and overlooked the whole, and Mount Franklin whose lofty\\nhead was still whitened with snow.\\n\\n“How beautiful it is!” cried Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes, our island is beautiful and good,” replied Pencroft. “I love it as\\nI loved my poor mother. It received us poor and destitute, and now what\\nis wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?”\\n\\n“Nothing,” replied Neb; “nothing, captain.”\\n\\nAnd the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of their\\nisland!\\n\\nDuring all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast, sketched\\nthe panorama which was developed before his eyes.\\n\\nCyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.\\n\\n“Well, Captain Harding,” asked Pencroft, “what do you think of our\\nvessel?”\\n\\n“She appears to behave well,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“Good! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some\\nextent?”\\n\\n“What voyage, Pencroft?”\\n\\n“One to Tabor Island, for instance.”\\n\\n“My friend,” replied Harding, “I think that in any pressing emergency\\nwe need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the ‘Bonadventure’ even for\\na longer voyage; but you know I should see you set off to Tabor Island\\nwith great uneasiness, since nothing obliges you to go there.”\\n\\n“One likes to know one’s neighbors,” returned the sailor, who was\\nobstinate in his idea. “Tabor Island is our neighbor, and the only one!\\nPoliteness requires us to go at least to pay a visit.”\\n\\n“By Jove,” said Spilett, “our friend Pencroft has become very particular\\nabout the proprieties all at once!”\\n\\n“I am not particular about anything at all,” retorted the sailor, who\\nwas rather vexed by the engineer’s opposition, but who did not wish to\\ncause him anxiety.\\n\\n“Consider, Pencroft,” resumed Harding, “you cannot go alone to Tabor\\nIsland.”\\n\\n“One companion will be enough for me.”\\n\\n“Even so,” replied the engineer, “you will risk depriving the colony of\\nLincoln Island of two settlers out of five.”\\n\\n“Out of six,” answered Pencroft; “you forget Jup.”\\n\\n“Out of seven,” added Neb; “Top is quite worth another.”\\n\\n“There is no risk at all in it, captain,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“That is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose ourselves\\nuselessly.”\\n\\nThe obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation drop, quite\\ndetermined to resume it again. But he did not suspect that an incident\\nwould come to his aid and change into an act of humanity that which was\\nat first only a doubtful whim.\\n\\nAfter standing off the shore the “Bonadventure” again approached it\\nin the direction of Port Balloon. It was important to ascertain the\\nchannels between the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be laid down\\nsince this little creek was to be the harbor.\\n\\nThey were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was necessary\\nto tack to beat against the wind. The “Bonadventure” was then going at a\\nvery moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land,\\nscarcely swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only\\nrippled now and then by passing gusts.\\n\\nHerbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate the\\ncourse to be followed among the channels, when all at once he shouted,--\\n\\n“Luff, Pencroft, luff!”\\n\\n“What’s the matter,” replied the sailor; “a rock?”\\n\\n“No--wait,” said Herbert; “I don’t quite see. Luff again--right--now.”\\n\\nSo saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into the\\nwater, and pulled it out, exclaiming,--\\n\\n“A bottle!”\\n\\nHe held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a few\\ncables’ length from the shore.\\n\\nCyrus Harding took the bottle. Without uttering a single word he drew\\nthe cork, and took from it a damp paper, on which were written these\\nwords:--\\n\\n“Castaway.... Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11’ S. lat.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n“A castaway!” exclaimed Pencroft; “left on this Tabor Island not two\\nhundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won’t now oppose my\\ngoing.”\\n\\n“No, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding; “and you shall set out as soon as\\npossible.”\\n\\n“To-morrow?”\\n\\n“To-morrow!”\\n\\nThe engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from\\nthe bottle. He contemplated it for some instants, then resumed,\\n\\n“From this document, my friends, from the way in which it is worded,\\nwe may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor Island is a man\\npossessing a considerable knowledge of navigation, since he gives the\\nlatitude and longitude of the island exactly as we ourselves found it,\\nand to a second of approximation; secondly, that he is either English or\\nAmerican, as the document is written in the English language.”\\n\\n“That is perfectly logical,” answered Spilett; “and the presence of this\\ncastaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of our island.\\nThere must have been a wreck, since there is a castaway. As to the\\nlatter, whoever he may be, it is lucky for him that Pencroft thought of\\nbuilding this boat and of trying her this very day, for a day later and\\nthis bottle might have been broken on the rocks.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” said Herbert, “it is a fortunate chance that the\\n‘Bonadventure’ passed exactly where the bottle was still floating!”\\n\\n“Does not this appear strange to you?” asked Harding of Pencroft.\\n\\n“It appears fortunate, that’s all,” answered the sailor. “Do you see\\nanything extraordinary in it, captain? The bottle must go somewhere, and\\nwhy not here as well as anywhere else?”\\n\\n“Perhaps you are right, Pencroft,” replied the engineer; “and yet--”\\n\\n“But,” observed Herbert, “there’s nothing to prove that this bottle has\\nbeen floating long in the sea.”\\n\\n“Nothing,” replied Gideon Spilett, “and the document appears even to\\nhave been recently written. What do you think about it, Cyrus?”\\n\\nDuring this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive. He had put\\nthe vessel about, and the “Bonadventure,” all sails set, was running\\nrapidly towards Claw Cape.\\n\\nEvery one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island. Should they\\nbe in time to save him? This was a great event in the life of the\\ncolonists! They themselves were but castaways, but it was to be feared\\nthat another might not have been so fortunate, and their duty was to go\\nto his succor.\\n\\nClaw Cape was doubled, and about four o’clock the “Bonadventure” dropped\\nher anchor at the mouth of the Mercy.\\n\\nThat same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were made.\\nIt appeared best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to work the\\nvessel, should undertake the voyage alone. By setting out the next day,\\nthe 10th of October, they would arrive on the 13th, for with the present\\nwind it would not take more than forty-eight hours to make this passage\\nof a hundred and fifty miles. One day in the island, three or four to\\nreturn, they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again\\nreach Lincoln Island. The weather was fine, the barometer was rising,\\nthe wind appeared settled, everything then was in favor of these brave\\nmen whom an act of humanity was taking far from their island.\\n\\nThus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon Spilett\\nshould remain at Granite House, but an objection was raised, and\\nSpilett, who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the New York\\nHerald, having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose\\nsuch an opportunity, he was admitted to take a part in the voyage.\\n\\nThe evening was occupied in transporting on board the “Bonadventure,”\\n articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a compass, provisions\\nfor a week; this being rapidly done, the colonists ascended to Granite\\nHouse.\\n\\nThe next day, at five o’clock in the morning, the farewells were said,\\nnot without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting sail made\\ntowards Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to proceed to the\\nsouthwest.\\n\\nThe “Bonadventure” was already a quarter of a mile from the coast when\\nthe passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House two men waving\\ntheir farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and Neb.\\n\\n“Our friends,” exclaimed Spilett, “this is our first separation in\\nfifteen months.”\\n\\nPencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite House\\nsoon disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape.\\n\\nDuring the first part of the day the “Bonadventure” was still in sight\\nof the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared just like\\na green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the center. The heights,\\ndiminished by distance, did not present an appearance likely to tempt\\nvessels to touch there. Reptile End was passed in about an hour, though\\nat a distance of about ten miles.\\n\\nAt this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish anything of\\nthe Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges of Mount Franklin,\\nand three hours after the last of Lincoln Island sank below the horizon.\\n\\nThe “Bonadventure” behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves she\\nproceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the foresail, and\\nsteering by the compass followed a rectilinear direction. From time to\\ntime Herbert relieved him at the helm, and the lad’s hand was so firm\\nthat the sailor had not a point to find fault with.\\n\\nGideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the other, if\\nwanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain Pencroft was perfectly\\nsatisfied with his crew.\\n\\nIn the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its first\\nquarter until the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set again. The\\nnight was dark but starry, and the next day again promised to be fine.\\n\\nPencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be caught by\\na sudden gust while carrying too much canvas; it was perhaps an\\nunnecessary precaution on such a calm night, but Pencroft was a prudent\\nsailor and cannot be blamed for it.\\n\\nThe reporter slept part of the night. Pencroft and Herbert took turns\\nfor a spell of two hours each at the helm. The sailor trusted Herbert as\\nhe would himself, and his confidence was justified by the coolness and\\njudgment of the lad. Pencroft gave him his directions as a commander to\\nhis steersman, and Herbert never allowed the “Bonadventure” to swerve\\neven a point. The night passed quickly, as did the day of the 12th of\\nOctober. A south-easterly direction was strictly maintained. Unless the\\n“Bonadventure” fell in with some unknown current she would come exactly\\nwithin sight of Tabor Island.\\n\\nAs to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was absolutely\\ndeserted. Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird passed within\\ngunshot, and Gideon Spilett wondered if it was to one of them that he\\nhad confided his last letter addressed to the New York Herald. These\\nbirds were the only beings that appeared to frequent this part of the\\nocean between Tabor and Lincoln Islands.\\n\\n“And yet,” observed Herbert, “this is the time that whalers usually\\nproceed towards the southern part of the Pacific. Indeed I do not think\\nthere could be a more deserted sea than this.”\\n\\n“It is not quite so deserted as all that,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“We are on it. Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?”\\n\\nAnd Pencroft laughed at his joke.\\n\\nBy the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that the\\n“Bonadventure” had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles\\nsince her departure from Lincoln Island, that is to say in thirty-six\\nhours, which would give her a speed of between three and four knots.\\nThe breeze was very slight and might soon drop altogether.\\nHowever, it was hoped that the next morning by break of day, if the\\ncalculation had been correct and the course true, they would sight Tabor\\nIsland.\\n\\nNeither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night. In the\\nexpectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion.\\nThere was so much uncertainty in their enterprise! Were they near Tabor\\nIsland? Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor\\nthey had come? Who was this man? Would not his presence disturb the\\nlittle colony till then so united? Besides, would he be content to\\nexchange his prison for another? All these questions, which would no\\ndoubt be answered the next day, kept them in suspense, and at the dawn\\nof day they all fixed their gaze on the western horizon.\\n\\n“Land!” shouted Pencroft at about six o’clock in the morning.\\n\\nAnd it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was\\nevident that land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of\\nthe “Bonadventure.” In a few hours they would land on the beach of the\\nisland!\\n\\nThe low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea, was not\\nmore than fifteen miles distant.\\n\\nThe head of the “Bonadventure,” which was a little to the south of the\\nisland, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted in the east,\\nits rays fell upon one or two headlands.\\n\\n“This is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,” observed\\nHerbert, “and is probably due like ours to some submarine convulsion.”\\n\\nAt eleven o’clock the “Bonadventure” was not more than two miles off,\\nand Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to land,\\nproceeded very cautiously through the unknown waters. The whole of the\\nisland could now be surveyed, and on it could be seen groups of gum\\nand other large trees, of the same species as those growing on Lincoln\\nIsland. But the astonishing thing was that no smoke arose to show that\\nthe island was inhabited, no signal whatever appeared on the shore!\\n\\nAnd yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and this\\ncastaway should have been on the watch.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the “Bonadventure” entered the winding channels among\\nthe reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme care. He had\\nput Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows, inspecting the\\nwater, while he held the halliard in his hand, ready to lower the sail\\nat a moment’s notice. Gideon Spilett with his glass eagerly scanned the\\nshore, though without perceiving anything.\\n\\nHowever, at about twelve o’clock the keel of the “Bonadventure” grated\\non the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew of\\nthe little vessel landed.\\n\\nAnd there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island, since\\naccording to the most recent charts there was no island in this part of\\nthe Pacific between New Zealand and the American Coast.\\n\\nThe vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no danger of\\nher being carried away by the receding tide; then Pencroft and his\\ncompanions, well armed, ascended the shore, so as to gain an elevation\\nof about two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet which rose at a\\ndistance of half a mile.\\n\\n“From the summit of that hill,” said Spilett, “we can no doubt obtain a\\ncomplete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate our search.”\\n\\n“So as to do here,” replied Herbert, “that which Captain Harding did the\\nvery first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount Franklin.”\\n\\n“Exactly so,” answered the reporter, “and it is the best plan.”\\n\\nWhile thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing\\nwhich terminated at the foot of the hill. Flocks of rock-pigeons and\\nsea-swallows, similar to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered around them.\\nUnder the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the\\nbushes rustling and see the grass waving, which indicated the presence\\nof timid animals, but still nothing to show that the island was\\ninhabited.\\n\\nArrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed\\nit in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon.\\n\\nThey were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles in\\ncircumference, its shape not much bordered by capes or promontories,\\nbays or creeks, being a lengthened oval. All around, the lonely sea\\nextended to the limits of the horizon. No land nor even a sail was in\\nsight.\\n\\nThis woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island,\\narid and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other. On the\\ncontrary this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or\\nthree hills of no great height. Obliquely to the oval of the island ran\\na stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a\\nnarrow mouth.\\n\\n“The domain is limited,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes,” rejoined Pencroft: “It would have been too small for us.”\\n\\n“And moreover,” said the reporter, “it appears to be uninhabited.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” answered Herbert, “nothing here betrays the presence of man.”\\n\\n“Let us go down,” said Pencroft, “and search.”\\n\\nThe sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the place\\nwhere they had left the “Bonadventure.”\\n\\nThey had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before\\nexploring the interior; so that not a spot should escape their\\ninvestigations. The beach was easy to follow, and only in some places\\nwas their way barred by large rocks, which, however, they easily passed\\nround. The explorers proceeded towards the south, disturbing numerous\\nflocks of sea-birds and herds of seals, which threw themselves into the\\nsea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance.\\n\\n“Those beasts yonder,” observed the reporter, “do not see men for the\\nfirst time. They fear them, therefore they must know them.”\\n\\nAn hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the\\nislet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the north along\\nthe western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks, the background\\nbordered with thick woods.\\n\\nThere was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print of a\\nhuman foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours’ walking\\nhad been gone completely round.\\n\\nIt was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were compelled to\\nbelieve that Tabor Island was not or was no longer inhabited. Perhaps,\\nafter all the document was already several months or several years old,\\nand it was possible in this case, either that the castaway had been\\nenabled to return to his country, or that he had died of misery.\\n\\nPencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable\\nconjectures, dined rapidly on board the “Bonadventure” so as to be\\nable to continue their excursion until nightfall. This was done at five\\no’clock in the evening, at which hour they entered the wood.\\n\\nNumerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one might\\nsay, only goats and pigs, which were obviously European species.\\n\\nDoubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they had\\nrapidly increased. Herbert resolved to catch one or two living, and take\\nthem back to Lincoln Island.\\n\\nIt was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited\\nthis islet, and this became still more evident when paths appeared\\ntrodden through the forest, felled trees, and everywhere traces of the\\nhand of man; but the trees were becoming rotten, and had been felled\\nmany years ago; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss, and the\\ngrass grew long and thick on the paths, so that it was difficult to find\\nthem.\\n\\n“But,” observed Gideon Spilett, “this not only proves that men have\\nlanded on the island, but also that they lived on it for some time. Now,\\nwho were these men? How many of them remain?”\\n\\n“The document,” said Herbert, “only spoke of one castaway.”\\n\\n“Well, if he is still on the island,” replied Pencroft, “it is\\nimpossible but that we shall find him.”\\n\\nThe exploration was continued. The sailor and his companions naturally\\nfollowed the route which cut diagonally across the island, and they were\\nthus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea.\\n\\nIf the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand, showed\\nincontestably that men had already visited the island, several specimens\\nof the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less. In some places, in the\\nmidst of clearings, it was evident that the soil had been planted with\\nculinary plants, at probably the same distant period.\\n\\nWhat, then, was Herbert’s joy, when he recognized potatoes, chicory,\\nsorrel, carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was sufficient to\\ncollect the seed to enrich the soil of Lincoln Island.\\n\\n“Capital, jolly!” exclaimed Pencroft. “That will suit Neb as well as us.\\nEven if we do not find the castaway, at least our voyage will not have\\nbeen useless, and God will have rewarded us.”\\n\\n“Doubtless,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but to see the state in which we\\nfind these plantations, it is to be feared that the island has not been\\ninhabited for some time.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” answered Herbert, “an inhabitant, whoever he was, could not\\nhave neglected such an important culture!”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Pencroft, “the castaway has gone.”\\n\\n“We must suppose so.”\\n\\n“It must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date?”\\n\\n“Evidently.”\\n\\n“And that the bottle only arrived at Lincoln Island after having floated\\nin the sea a long time.”\\n\\n“Why not?” returned Pencroft. “But night is coming on,” added he, “and I\\nthink that it will be best to give up the search for the present.”\\n\\n“Let us go on board, and to-morrow we will begin again,” said the\\nreporter.\\n\\nThis was the wisest course, and it was about to be followed when\\nHerbert, pointing to a confused mass among the trees, exclaimed,--\\n\\n“A hut!”\\n\\nAll three immediately ran towards the dwelling. In the twilight it was\\njust possible to see that it was built of planks and covered with a\\nthick tarpaulin.\\n\\nThe half-closed door was pushed open by Pencroft, who entered with a\\nrapid step.\\n\\nThe hut was empty!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\nPencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett remained silent in the midst of\\nthe darkness.\\n\\nPencroft shouted loudly.\\n\\nNo reply was made.\\n\\nThe sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig. This lighted for\\na minute a small room, which appeared perfectly empty. At the back was\\na rude fireplace, with a few cold cinders, supporting an armful of dry\\nwood. Pencroft threw the blazing twig on it, the wood crackled and gave\\nforth a bright light.\\n\\nThe sailor and his two companions then perceived a disordered bed, of\\nwhich the damp and yellow coverlets proved that it had not been used for\\na long time. In the corner of the fireplace were two kettles, covered\\nwith rust, and an overthrown pot. A cupboard, with a few moldy sailor’s\\nclothes; on the table a tin plate and a Bible, eaten away by damp; in a\\ncorner a few tools, a spade, pickaxe, two fowling-pieces, one of which\\nwas broken; on a plank, forming a shelf, stood a barrel of powder, still\\nuntouched, a barrel of shot, and several boxes of caps, all thickly\\ncovered with dust, accumulated, perhaps, by many long years.\\n\\n“There is no one here,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“No one,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“It is a long time since this room has been inhabited,” observed\\nHerbert.\\n\\n“Yes, a very long time!” answered the reporter.\\n\\n“Mr. Spilett,” then said Pencroft, “instead of returning on board, I\\nthink that it would be well to pass the night in this hut.”\\n\\n“You are right, Pencroft,” answered Gideon Spilett, “and if its owner\\nreturns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place taken\\npossession of.”\\n\\n“He will not return,” said the sailor, shaking his head.\\n\\n“You think that he has quitted the island?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“If he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and\\nhis tools,” replied Pencroft. “You know the value which castaways set\\non such articles as these the last remains of a wreck. No! no!” repeated\\nthe sailor, in a tone of conviction; “no, he has not left the island! If\\nhe had escaped in a boat made by himself, he would still less have left\\nthese indispensable and necessary articles. No! he is on the island!”\\n\\n“Living?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“Living or dead. But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried himself,\\nand so we shall at least find his remains!”\\n\\nIt was then agreed that the night should be passed in the deserted\\ndwelling, and a store of wood found in a corner was sufficient to warm\\nit. The door closed, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett remained there,\\nseated on a bench, talking little but wondering much. They were in a\\nframe of mind to imagine anything or expect anything. They listened\\neagerly for sounds outside. The door might have opened suddenly, and\\na man presented himself to them without their being in the least\\nsurprised, notwithstanding all that the hut revealed of abandonment,\\nand they had their hands ready to press the hands of this man, this\\ncastaway, this unknown friend, for whom friends were waiting.\\n\\nBut no voice was heard, the door did not open. The hours thus passed\\naway.\\n\\nHow long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions! Herbert\\nalone slept for two hours, for at his age sleep is a necessity. They\\nwere all three anxious to continue their exploration of the day before,\\nand to search the most secret recesses of the islet! The inferences\\ndeduced by Pencroft were perfectly reasonable, and it was nearly certain\\nthat, as the hut was deserted, and the tools, utensils, and weapons were\\nstill there, the owner had succumbed. It was agreed, therefore, that\\nthey should search for his remains, and give them at least Christian\\nburial.\\n\\nDay dawned; Pencroft and his companions immediately proceeded to survey\\nthe dwelling. It had certainly been built in a favorable situation,\\nat the back of a little hill, sheltered by five or six magnificent\\ngum-trees. Before its front and through the trees the axe had prepared\\na wide clearing, which allowed the view to extend to the sea. Beyond a\\nlawn, surrounded by a wooden fence falling to pieces, was the shore, on\\nthe left of which was the mouth of the stream.\\n\\nThe hut had been built of planks, and it was easy to see that these\\nplanks had been obtained from the hull or deck of a ship. It was\\nprobable that a disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of the\\nisland, that one at least of the crew had been saved, and that by means\\nof the wreck this man, having tools at his disposal, had built the\\ndwelling.\\n\\nAnd this became still more evident when Gideon Spilett, after having\\nwalked around the hut, saw on a plank, probably one of those which\\nhad formed the armor of the wrecked vessel, these letters already half\\neffaced:\\n\\n\\n              BR--TAN--A\\n\\n\\n“Britannia,” exclaimed Pencroft, whom the reporter had called; “it is\\na common name for ships, and I could not say if she was English or\\nAmerican!”\\n\\n“It matters very little, Pencroft!”\\n\\n“Very little indeed,” answered the sailor, “and we will save the\\nsurvivor of her crew if he is still living, to whatever country he may\\nbelong. But before beginning our search again let us go on board the\\n‘Bonadventure’.”\\n\\nA sort of uneasiness had seized Pencroft upon the subject of his vessel.\\nShould the island be inhabited after all, and should some one have taken\\npossession of her? But he shrugged his shoulders at such an unreasonable\\nsupposition. At any rate the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on\\nboard. The road already trodden was not long, scarcely a mile. They set\\nout on their walk, gazing into the wood and thickets through which goats\\nand pigs fled in hundreds.\\n\\nTwenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions reached\\nthe western coast of the island, and saw the “Bonadventure” held fast by\\nher anchor, which was buried deep in the sand.\\n\\nPencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction. After all this\\nvessel was his child, and it is the right of fathers to be often uneasy\\nwhen there is no occasion for it.\\n\\nThey returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be necessary\\nto dine until very late; then the repast being ended, the exploration\\nwas continued and conducted with the most minute care. Indeed, it was\\nvery probable that the only inhabitant of the island had perished. It\\nwas therefore more for the traces of a dead than of a living man that\\nPencroft and his companions searched. But their searches were vain, and\\nduring the half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets\\nof trees which covered the islet. There was then scarcely any doubt\\nthat, if the castaway was dead, no trace of his body now remained, but\\nthat some wild beast had probably devoured it to the last bone.\\n\\n“We will set off to-morrow at daybreak,” said Pencroft to his two\\ncompanions, as about two o’clock they were resting for a few minutes\\nunder the shade of a clump of firs.\\n\\n“I should think that we might without scruple take the utensils which\\nbelonged to the castaway,” added Herbert.\\n\\n“I think so, too,” returned Gideon Spilett, “and these arms and tools\\nwill make up the stores of Granite House. The supply of powder and shot\\nis also most important.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “but we must not forget to capture a couple or\\ntwo of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is destitute.”\\n\\n“Nor to gather those seeds,” added Herbert, “which will give us all the\\nvegetables of the Old and the New Worlds.”\\n\\n“Then perhaps it would be best,” said the reporter, “to remain a day\\nlonger on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful to us.”\\n\\n“No, Mr. Spilett,” answered Pencroft, “I will ask you to set off\\nto-morrow at daybreak. The wind seems to me to be likely to shift to the\\nwest, and after having had a fair wind for coming we shall have a fair\\nwind for going back.”\\n\\n“Then do not let us lose time,” said Herbert, rising.\\n\\n“We won’t waste time,” returned Pencroft. “You, Herbert, go and gather\\nthe seeds, which you know better than we do. While you do that, Mr.\\nSpilett and I will go and have a pig hunt, and even without Top I hope\\nwe shall manage to catch a few!”\\n\\nHerbert accordingly took the path which led towards the cultivated part\\nof the islet, while the sailor and the reporter entered the forest.\\n\\nMany specimens of the porcine race fled before them, and these animals,\\nwhich were singularly active, did not appear to be in a humor to allow\\nthemselves to be approached.\\n\\nHowever, after an hour’s chase, the hunters had just managed to get hold\\nof a couple lying in a thicket, when cries were heard resounding from\\nthe north part of the island, With the cries were mingled terrible\\nyells, in which there was nothing human.\\n\\nPencroft and Gideon Spilett were at once on their feet, and the pigs\\nby this movement began to run away, at the moment when the sailor was\\ngetting ready the rope to bind them.\\n\\n“That’s Herbert’s voice,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Run!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\nAnd the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the\\nspot from whence the cries proceeded.\\n\\nThey did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a clearing they\\nsaw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being,\\napparently a gigantic ape, who was about to do him some great harm.\\n\\nTo rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn, snatch\\nHerbert from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a minute for\\nPencroft and Gideon Spilett. The sailor was of Herculean strength, the\\nreporter also very powerful, and in spite of the monster’s resistance he\\nwas firmly tied so that he could not even move.\\n\\n“You are not hurt, Herbert?” asked Spilett.\\n\\n“No, no!”\\n\\n“Oh, if this ape had wounded him!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\n“But he is not an ape,” answered Herbert.\\n\\nAt these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the singular being\\nwho lay on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it was a human being,\\na man. But what a man! A savage in all the horrible acceptation of the\\nword, and so much the more frightful that he seemed fallen to the lowest\\ndegree of brutishness!\\n\\nShaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body almost\\nnaked except a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous hands with\\nimmensely long nails, skin the color of mahogany, feet as hard as if\\nmade of horn, such was the miserable creature who yet had a claim to be\\ncalled a man. But it might justly be asked if there were yet a soul in\\nthis body, or if the brute instinct alone survived in it!\\n\\n“Are you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?”\\n said Pencroft to the reporter.\\n\\n“Alas! there is no doubt about it,” replied Spilett.\\n\\n“Then this must be the castaway?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but the unfortunate man has no longer\\nanything human about him!”\\n\\nThe reporter spoke the truth. It was evident that if the castaway had\\never been a civilized being, solitude had made him a savage, or worse,\\nperhaps a regular man of the woods. Hoarse sounds issued from his throat\\nbetween his teeth, which were sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to\\ntear raw flesh.\\n\\nMemory must have deserted him long before, and for a long time also he\\nhad forgotten how to use his gun and tools, and he no longer knew how to\\nmake a fire! It could be seen that he was active and powerful, but the\\nphysical qualities had been developed in him to the injury of the moral\\nqualities. Gideon Spilett spoke to him. He did not appear to understand\\nor even to hear. And yet on looking into his eyes, the reporter thought\\nhe could see that all reason was not extinguished in him. However, the\\nprisoner did not struggle, nor even attempt to break his bonds. Was he\\noverwhelmed by the presence of men whose fellow he had once been? Had he\\nfound in some corner of his brain a fleeting remembrance which recalled\\nhim to humanity? If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?\\nThey could not tell, but they did not make the experiment; and after\\ngazing attentively at the miserable creature,--\\n\\n“Whoever he may be,” remarked Gideon Spilett, “whoever he may have\\nbeen, and whatever he may become, it is our duty to take him with us to\\nLincoln Island.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes!” replied Herbert, “and perhaps with care we may arouse in him\\nsome gleam of intelligence.”\\n\\n“The soul does not die,” said the reporter, “and it would be a great\\nsatisfaction to rescue one of God’s creatures from brutishness.”\\n\\nPencroft shook his head doubtfully.\\n\\n“We must try at any rate,” returned the reporter; “humanity commands\\nus.”\\n\\nIt was indeed their duty as Christians and civilized beings. All three\\nfelt this, and they well knew that Cyrus Harding would approve of their\\nacting thus.\\n\\n“Shall we leave him bound?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“Perhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Let us try,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\nThe cords which shackled the prisoner’s feet were cut off, but his arms\\nremained securely fastened. He got up by himself and did not manifest\\nany desire to run away. His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the\\nthree men, who walked near him, but nothing denoted that he recollected\\nbeing their fellow, or at least having been so. A continual hissing\\nsound issued from his lips, his aspect was wild, but he did not attempt\\nto resist.\\n\\nBy the reporter’s advice the unfortunate man was taken to the hut.\\nPerhaps the sight of the things that belonged to him would make some\\nimpression on him! Perhaps a spark would be sufficient to revive his\\nobscured intellect, to rekindle his dulled soul. The dwelling was\\nnot far off. In a few minutes they arrived there, but the prisoner\\nremembered nothing, and it appeared that he had lost consciousness of\\neverything.\\n\\nWhat could they think of the degree of brutishness into which this\\nmiserable being had fallen, unless that his imprisonment on the islet\\ndated from a very distant period and after having arrived there a\\nrational being solitude had reduced him to this condition.\\n\\nThe reporter then thought that perhaps the sight of fire would have\\nsome effect on him, and in a moment one of those beautiful flames, that\\nattract even animals, blazed up on the hearth. The sight of the flame\\nseemed at first to fix the attention of the unhappy object, but soon\\nhe turned away and the look of intelligence faded. Evidently there was\\nnothing to be done, for the time at least, but to take him on board\\nthe “Bonadventure.” This was done, and he remained there in Pencroft’s\\ncharge.\\n\\nHerbert and Spilett returned to finish their work; and some hours after\\nthey came back to the shore, carrying the utensils and guns, a store of\\nvegetables, of seeds, some game, and two couple of pigs.\\n\\nAll was embarked, and the “Bonadventure” was ready to weigh anchor and\\nsail with the morning tide.\\n\\nThe prisoner had been placed in the fore-cabin, where he remained quiet,\\nsilent, apparently deaf and dumb.\\n\\nPencroft offered him something to eat, but he pushed away the cooked\\nmeat that was presented to him and which doubtless did not suit him. But\\non the sailor showing him one of the ducks which Herbert had killed, he\\npounced on it like a wild beast, and devoured it greedily.\\n\\n“You think that he will recover his senses?” asked Pencroft. “It is\\nnot impossible that our care will have an effect upon him, for it is\\nsolitude that has made him what he is, and from this time forward he\\nwill be no longer alone.”\\n\\n“The poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time,”\\n said Herbert.\\n\\n“Perhaps,” answered Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“About what age is he?” asked the lad.\\n\\n“It is difficult to say,” replied the reporter, “for it is impossible to\\nsee his features under the thick beard which covers his face, but he is\\nno longer young, and I suppose he might be about fifty.”\\n\\n“Have you noticed, Mr. Spilett, how deeply sunk his eyes are?” asked\\nHerbert.\\n\\n“Yes, Herbert, but I must add that they are more human than one could\\nexpect from his appearance.”\\n\\n“However, we shall see,” replied Pencroft, “and I am anxious to know\\nwhat opinion Captain Harding will have of our savage. We went to look\\nfor a human creature, and we are bringing back a monster! After all, we\\ndid what we could.”\\n\\nThe night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could not be\\nknown, but at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did not\\nmove. He was like a wild animal, which appears stunned at first by its\\ncapture, and becomes wild again afterwards.\\n\\n\\nAt daybreak the next morning, the 15th of October, the change of weather\\npredicted by Pencroft occurred. The wind having shifted to the northwest\\nfavored the return of the “Bonadventure,” but at the same time it\\nfreshened, which might render navigation more difficult.\\n\\nAt five o’clock in the morning the anchor was weighed. Pencroft took a\\nreef in the mainsail, and steered towards the north-east, so as to sail\\nstraight for Lincoln Island.\\n\\nThe first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident. The prisoner\\nremained quiet in the fore-cabin, and as he had been a sailor it\\nappeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary\\nreaction. Did some recollection of his former calling return to him?\\nHowever that might be, he remained tranquil, astonished rather than\\ndepressed.\\n\\nThe next day the wind increased, blowing more from the north,\\nconsequently in a less favorable direction for the “Bonadventure.”\\n Pencroft was soon obliged to sail close-hauled, and without saying\\nanything about it he began to be uneasy at the state of the sea, which\\nfrequently broke over the bows. Certainly, if the wind did not moderate,\\nit would take a longer time to reach Lincoln Island than it had taken to\\nmake Tabor Island.\\n\\nIndeed, on the morning of the 17th, the “Bonadventure” had been\\nforty-eight hours at sea, and nothing showed that she was near the\\nisland. It was impossible, besides, to estimate the distance traversed,\\nor to trust to the reckoning for the direction, as the speed had been\\nvery irregular.\\n\\nTwenty-four hours after there was yet no land in sight. The wind was\\nright ahead and the sea very heavy. The sails were close-reefed, and\\nthey tacked frequently. On the 18th, a wave swept completely over the\\n“Bonadventure”; and if the crew had not taken the precaution of lashing\\nthemselves to the deck, they would have been carried away.\\n\\nOn this occasion Pencroft and his companions, who were occupied with\\nloosing themselves, received unexpected aid from the prisoner, who\\nemerged from the hatchway as if his sailor’s instinct had suddenly\\nreturned, broke a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so as to let\\nthe water which filled the deck escape. Then the vessel being clear, he\\ndescended to his cabin without having uttered a word. Pencroft, Gideon\\nSpilett, and Herbert, greatly astonished, let him proceed.\\n\\nTheir situation was truly serious, and the sailor had reason to fear\\nthat he was lost on the wide sea without any possibility of recovering\\nhis course.\\n\\nThe night was dark and cold. However, about eleven o’clock, the wind\\nfell, the sea went down, and the speed of the vessel, as she labored\\nless, greatly increased.\\n\\nNeither Pencroft, Spilett, nor Herbert thought of taking an hour’s\\nsleep. They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island could not\\nbe far distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the “Bonadventure,”\\n carried away by currents, had drifted so much that it would be\\nimpossible to rectify her course. Pencroft, uneasy to the last degree,\\nyet did not despair, for he had a gallant heart, and grasping the tiller\\nhe anxiously endeavored to pierce the darkness which surrounded them.\\n\\nAbout two o’clock in the morning he started forward,--\\n\\n“A light! a light!” he shouted.\\n\\nIndeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the northeast. Lincoln\\nIsland was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus Harding,\\nshowed them the course to be followed. Pencroft, who was bearing too\\nmuch to the north, altered his course and steered towards the fire,\\nwhich burned brightly above the horizon like a star of the first\\nmagnitude.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\nThe next day, the 20th of October, at seven o’clock in the morning,\\nafter a voyage of four days, the “Bonadventure” gently glided up to the\\nbeach at the mouth of the Mercy.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad weather and\\nthe prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed at daybreak to\\nthe plateau of Prospect Heights, and they had at last caught sight of\\nthe vessel which had been so long in returning.\\n\\n“God be praised! there they are!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nAs to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round, clapping his\\nhands and shouting, “Oh! my master!” A more touching pantomime than the\\nfinest discourse.\\n\\nThe engineer’s first idea, on counting the people on the deck of the\\n“Bonadventure,” was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of Tabor\\nIsland, or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused to leave his\\nisland and change one prison for another.\\n\\nIndeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the deck of\\nthe “Bonadventure.”\\n\\nThe moment the vessel touched, the engineer and Neb were waiting on\\nthe beach, and before the passengers had time to leap on to the sand,\\nHarding said: “We have been very uneasy at your delay, my friends! Did\\nyou meet with any accident?”\\n\\n“No,” replied Gideon Spilett; “on the contrary, everything went\\nwonderfully well. We will tell you all about it.”\\n\\n“However,” returned the engineer, “your search has been unsuccessful,\\nsince you are only three, just as you went!”\\n\\n“Excuse me, captain,” replied the sailor, “we are four.”\\n\\n“You have found the castaway?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And you have brought him?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Living?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“Where is he? Who is he?”\\n\\n“He is,” replied the reporter, “or rather he was a man! There, Cyrus,\\nthat is all we can tell you!”\\n\\nThe engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage,\\nand under what conditions the search had been conducted; how the only\\ndwelling in the island had long been abandoned; how at last a castaway\\nhad been captured, who appeared no longer to belong to the human\\nspecies.\\n\\n“And that’s just the point,” added Pencroft, “I don’t know if we have\\ndone right to bring him here.”\\n\\n“Certainly you have, Pencroft,” replied the engineer quickly.\\n\\n“But the wretched creature has no sense!”\\n\\n“That is possible at present,” replied Cyrus Harding, “but only a few\\nmonths ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me. And who\\nknows what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on\\nthis island? It is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it\\nmust be believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason, since you\\nhave found this poor creature in such a state!”\\n\\n“But, captain,” asked Herbert, “what leads you to think that the\\nbrutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months back?”\\n\\n“Because the document we found had been recently written,” answered the\\nengineer, “and the castaway alone can have written it.”\\n\\n“Always supposing,” observed Gideon Spilett, “that it had not been\\nwritten by a companion of this man, since dead.”\\n\\n“That is impossible, my dear Spilett.”\\n\\n“Why so?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“Because the document would then have spoken of two castaways,” replied\\nHarding, “and it mentioned only one.”\\n\\nHerbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage, and\\ndwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner’s\\nmind, when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a\\nsailor.\\n\\n“Well, Herbert,” replied the engineer, “you are right to attach great\\nimportance to this fact. The unfortunate man cannot be incurable, and\\ndespair has made him what he is; but here he will find his fellow-men,\\nand since there is still a soul in him, this soul we shall save!”\\n\\nThe castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer and\\nthe great astonishment of Neb, was then brought from the cabin which he\\noccupied in the fore part of the “Bonadventure”; when once on land he\\nmanifested a wish to run away.\\n\\nBut Cyrus Harding approaching, placed his hand on his shoulder with a\\ngesture full of authority, and looked at him with infinite tenderness.\\nImmediately the unhappy man, submitting to a superior will, gradually\\nbecame calm, his eyes fell, his head bent, and he made no more\\nresistance.\\n\\n“Poor fellow!” murmured the engineer.\\n\\nCyrus Harding had attentively observed him. To judge by his appearance\\nthis miserable being had no longer anything human about him, and\\nyet Harding, as had the reporter already, observed in his look an\\nindefinable trace of intelligence.\\n\\nIt was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger as he was\\nthenceforth termed by his companions, should live in one of the rooms\\nof Granite House, from which, however, he could not escape. He was led\\nthere without difficulty, and with careful attention, it might, perhaps,\\nbe hoped that some day he would be a companion to the settlers in\\nLincoln Island.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, during breakfast, which Neb had hastened to prepare,\\nas the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft were dying of hunger, heard in\\ndetail all the incidents which had marked the voyage of exploration to\\nthe islet. He agreed with his friends on this point, that the stranger\\nmust be either English or American, the name Britannia leading them\\nto suppose this, and, besides, through the bushy beard, and under\\nthe shaggy, matted hair, the engineer thought he could recognize the\\ncharacteristic features of the Anglo-Saxon.\\n\\n“But, by the bye,” said Gideon Spilett, addressing Herbert, “you never\\ntold us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that you\\nwould have been strangled, if we had not happened to come up in time to\\nhelp you!”\\n\\n“Upon my word,” answered Herbert, “it is rather difficult to say how it\\nhappened. I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants, when I heard\\na noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree. I scarcely\\nhad time to look round. This unfortunate man, who was without doubt\\nconcealed in a tree, rushed upon me in less time than I take to tell you\\nabout it, and unless Mr. Spilett and Pencroft--”\\n\\n“My boy!” said Cyrus Harding, “you ran a great danger, but, perhaps,\\nwithout that, the poor creature would have still hidden himself from\\nyour search, and we should not have had a new companion.”\\n\\n“You hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?” asked the\\nreporter.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the engineer.\\n\\nBreakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House and\\nreturned to the beach. They there occupied themselves in unloading the\\n“Bonadventure,” and the engineer, having examined the arms and tools,\\nsaw nothing which could help them to establish the identity of the\\nstranger.\\n\\nThe capture of pigs, made on the islet, was looked upon as being very\\nprofitable to Lincoln Island, and the animals were led to the sty, where\\nthey soon became at home.\\n\\nThe two barrels, containing the powder and shot, as well as the box\\nof caps, were very welcome. It was agreed to establish a small\\npowder-magazine, either outside Granite House or in the Upper Cavern,\\nwhere there would be no fear of explosion. However, the use of pyroxyle\\nwas to be continued, for this substance giving excellent results, there\\nwas no reason for substituting ordinary powder.\\n\\nWhen the unloading of the vessel was finished,--\\n\\n“Captain,” said Pencroft, “I think it would be prudent to put our\\n‘Bonadventure’ in a safe place.”\\n\\n“Is she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?” asked Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“No, captain,” replied the sailor. “Half of the time she is stranded on\\nthe sand, and that works her. She is a famous craft, you see, and she\\nbehaved admirably during the squall which struck us on our return.”\\n\\n“Could she not float in the river?”\\n\\n“No doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there, and in the\\neast winds, I think that the ‘Bonadventure’ would suffer much from the\\nsurf.”\\n\\n“Well, where would you put her, Pencroft?”\\n\\n“In Port Balloon,” replied the sailor. “That little creek, shut in by\\nrocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want.”\\n\\n“Is it not rather far?”\\n\\n“Pooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and we have a\\nfine straight road to take us there!”\\n\\n“Do it then, Pencroft, and take your ‘Bonadventure’ there,” replied\\nthe engineer, “and yet I would rather have her under our more immediate\\nprotection. When we have time, we must make a little harbor for her.”\\n\\n“Famous!” exclaimed Pencroft. “A harbor with a lighthouse, a pier, and\\ndock! Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes easy.”\\n\\n“Yes, my brave Pencroft,” answered the engineer, “but on condition,\\nhowever, that you help me, for you do as much as three men in all our\\nwork.”\\n\\nHerbert and the sailor then re-embarked on board the “Bonadventure,”\\n the anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the wind drove her rapidly\\ntowards Claw Cape. Two hours after, she was reposing on the tranquil\\nwaters of Port Balloon.\\n\\nDuring the first days passed by the stranger in Granite House, had he\\nalready given them reason to think that his savage nature was becoming\\ntamed? Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind? In\\nshort, was the soul returning to the body?\\n\\nYes, to a certainty, and to such a degree, that Cyrus Harding and the\\nreporter wondered if the reason of the unfortunate man had ever been\\ntotally extinguished. At first, accustomed to the open air, to the\\nunrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on Tabor Island, the stranger\\nmanifested a sullen fury, and it was feared that he might throw\\nhimself onto the beach, out of one of the windows of Granite House.\\nBut gradually he became calmer, and more freedom was allowed to his\\nmovements.\\n\\nThey had reason to hope, and to hope much. Already, forgetting his\\ncarnivorous instincts, the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment\\nthan that on which he fed on the islet, and cooked meat did not produce\\nin him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had showed on board\\nthe “Bonadventure.” Cyrus Harding had profited by a moment when he was\\nsleeping, to cut his hair and matted beard, which formed a sort of\\nmane and gave him such a savage aspect. He had also been clothed more\\nsuitably, after having got rid of the rag which covered him. The result\\nwas that, thanks to these attentions, the stranger resumed a more\\nhuman appearance, and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder.\\nCertainly, when formerly lighted up by intelligence, this man’s face\\nmust have had a sort of beauty.\\n\\nEvery day, Harding imposed on himself the task of passing some hours\\nin his company. He came and worked near him, and occupied himself in\\ndifferent things, so as to fix his attention. A spark, indeed, would be\\nsufficient to reillumine that soul, a recollection crossing that brain\\nto recall reason. That had been seen, during the storm, on board the\\n“Bonadventure!” The engineer did not neglect either to speak aloud, so\\nas to penetrate at the same time by the organs of hearing and sight the\\ndepths of that torpid intelligence. Sometimes one of his companions,\\nsometimes another, sometimes all joined him. They spoke most often of\\nthings belonging to the navy, which must interest a sailor.\\n\\nAt times, the stranger gave some slight attention to what was said,\\nand the settlers were soon convinced that he partly understood them.\\nSometimes the expression of his countenance was deeply sorrowful, a\\nproof that he suffered mentally, for his face could not be mistaken;\\nbut he did not speak, although at different times, however, they almost\\nthought that words were about to issue from his lips. At all events, the\\npoor creature was quite quiet and sad!\\n\\nBut was not his calm only apparent? Was not his sadness only the result\\nof his seclusion? Nothing could yet be ascertained. Seeing only certain\\nobjects and in a limited space, always in contact with the colonists,\\nto whom he would soon become accustomed, having no desires to satisfy,\\nbetter fed, better clothed, it was natural that his physical nature\\nshould gradually improve; but was he penetrated with the sense of a new\\nlife? or rather, to employ a word which would be exactly applicable\\nto him, was he not becoming tamed, like an animal in company with his\\nmaster? This was an important question, which Cyrus Harding was anxious\\nto answer, and yet he did not wish to treat his invalid roughly! Would\\nhe ever be a convalescent?\\n\\nHow the engineer observed him every moment! How he was on the watch for\\nhis soul, if one may use the expression! How he was ready to grasp it!\\nThe settlers followed with real sympathy all the phases of the cure\\nundertaken by Harding. They aided him also in this work of humanity, and\\nall, except perhaps the incredulous Pencroft, soon shared both his hope\\nand his faith.\\n\\nThe calm of the stranger was deep, as has been said, and he even showed\\na sort of attachment for the engineer, whose influence he evidently\\nfelt. Cyrus Harding resolved then to try him, by transporting him\\nto another scene, from that ocean which formerly his eyes had been\\naccustomed to contemplate, to the border of the forest, which might\\nperhaps recall those where so many years of his life had been passed!\\n\\n“But,” said Gideon Spilett, “can we hope that he will not escape, if\\nonce set at liberty?”\\n\\n“The experiment must be tried,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“Well!” said Pencroft. “When that fellow is outside, and feels the fresh\\nair, he will be off as fast as his legs can carry him!”\\n\\n“I do not think so,” returned Harding.\\n\\n“Let us try,” said Spilett.\\n\\n“We will try,” replied the engineer.\\n\\nThis was on the 30th of October, and consequently the castaway of Tabor\\nIsland had been a prisoner in Granite House for nine days. It was\\nwarm, and a bright sun darted its rays on the island. Cyrus Harding and\\nPencroft went to the room occupied by the stranger, who was found lying\\nnear the window and gazing at the sky.\\n\\n“Come, my friend,” said the engineer to him.\\n\\nThe stranger rose immediately. His eyes were fixed on Cyrus Harding, and\\nhe followed him, while the sailor marched behind them, little confident\\nas to the result of the experiment.\\n\\nArrived at the door, Harding and Pencroft made him take his place in\\nthe lift, while Neb, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett waited for them before\\nGranite House. The lift descended, and in a few moments all were united\\non the beach.\\n\\nThe settlers went a short distance from the stranger, so as to leave him\\nat liberty.\\n\\nHe then made a few steps toward the sea, and his look brightened with\\nextreme animation, but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape.\\nHe was gazing at the little waves which, broken by the islet, rippled on\\nthe sand.\\n\\n“This is only the sea,” observed Gideon Spilett, “and possibly it does\\nnot inspire him with any wish to escape!”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Harding, “we must take him to the plateau, on the border\\nof the forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive.”\\n\\n“Besides, he could not run away,” said Neb, “since the bridge is\\nraised.”\\n\\n“Oh!” said Pencroft, “that isn’t a man to be troubled by a stream like\\nCreek Glycerine! He could cross it directly, at a single bound!”\\n\\n“We shall soon see,” Harding contented himself with replying, his eyes\\nnot quitting those of his patient.\\n\\nThe latter was then led towards the mouth of the Mercy, and all climbing\\nthe left bank of the river, reached Prospect Heights.\\n\\nArrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the\\nforest, their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the stranger\\nappeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the\\natmosphere, and a long sigh escaped from his chest.\\n\\nThe settlers kept behind him, ready to seize him if he made any movement\\nto escape!\\n\\nAnd, indeed, the poor creature was on the point of springing into the\\ncreek which separated him from the forest, and his legs were bent for an\\ninstant as if for a spring, but almost immediately he stepped back, half\\nsank down, and a large tear fell from his eyes.\\n\\n“Ah!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding, “you have become a man again, for you can\\nweep!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\nYes! the unfortunate man had wept! Some recollection doubtless had\\nflashed across his brain, and to use Cyrus Harding’s expression, by\\nthose tears he was once more a man.\\n\\nThe colonists left him for some time on the plateau, and withdrew\\nthemselves to a short distance, so that he might feel himself free; but\\nhe did not think of profiting by this liberty, and Harding soon brought\\nhim back to Granite House. Two days after this occurrence, the stranger\\nappeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life. He\\nevidently heard and understood, but no less evidently was he strangely\\ndetermined not to speak to the colonists; for one evening, Pencroft,\\nlistening at the door of his room, heard these words escape from his\\nlips:--\\n\\n“No! here! I! never!”\\n\\nThe sailor reported these words to his companions.\\n\\n“There is some painful mystery there!” said Harding.\\n\\nThe stranger had begun to use the laboring tools, and he worked in the\\ngarden. When he stopped in his work, as was often the case, he remained\\nretired within himself, but on the engineer’s recommendation, they\\nrespected the reserve which he apparently wished to keep. If one of the\\nsettlers approached him, he drew back, and his chest heaved with sobs,\\nas if overburdened!\\n\\nWas it remorse that overwhelmed him thus? They were compelled to believe\\nso, and Gideon Spilett could not help one day making this observation,--\\n\\n“If he does not speak it is because he has, I fear, things too serious\\nto be told!”\\n\\nThey must be patient and wait.\\n\\nA few days later, on the 3rd of November, the stranger, working on the\\nplateau, had stopped, letting his spade drop to the ground, and Harding,\\nwho was observing him from a little distance, saw that tears were again\\nflowing from his eyes. A sort of irresistible pity led him towards the\\nunfortunate man, and he touched his arm lightly.\\n\\n“My friend!” said he.\\n\\nThe stranger tried to avoid his look, and Cyrus Harding having\\nendeavored to take his hand, he drew back quickly.\\n\\n“My friend,” said Harding in a firmer voice, “look at me, I wish it!”\\n\\nThe stranger looked at the engineer, and seemed to be under his power,\\nas a subject under the influence of a mesmerist. He wished to run away.\\nBut then his countenance suddenly underwent a transformation. His eyes\\nflashed. Words struggled to escape from his lips. He could no longer\\ncontain himself! At last he folded his arms; then, in a hollow\\nvoice,--“Who are you?” he asked Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Castaways, like you,” replied the engineer, whose emotion was deep. “We\\nhave brought you here, among your fellow-men.”\\n\\n“My fellow-men!.... I have none!”\\n\\n“You are in the midst of friends.”\\n\\n“Friends!--for me! friends!” exclaimed the stranger, hiding his face in\\nhis hands. “No--never--leave me! leave me!”\\n\\nThen he rushed to the side of the plateau which overlooked the sea, and\\nremained there a long time motionless.\\n\\nHarding rejoined his companions and related to them what had just\\nhappened.\\n\\n“Yes! there is some mystery in that man’s life,” said Gideon Spilett,\\n“and it appears as if he had only re-entered society by the path of\\nremorse.”\\n\\n“I don’t know what sort of a man we have brought here,” said the sailor.\\n“He has secrets--”\\n\\n“Which we will respect,” interrupted Cyrus Harding quickly. “If he has\\ncommitted any crime, he has most fearfully expiated it, and in our eyes\\nhe is absolved.”\\n\\nFor two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore, evidently under\\nthe influence of recollections which recalled all his past life--a\\nmelancholy life doubtless--and the colonists, without losing sight of\\nhim, did not attempt to disturb his solitude. However, after two hours,\\nappearing to have formed a resolution, he came to find Cyrus Harding.\\nHis eyes were red with the tears he had shed, but he wept no longer.\\nHis countenance expressed deep humility. He appeared anxious, timorous,\\nashamed, and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground.\\n\\n“Sir,” said he to Harding, “your companions and you, are you English?”\\n\\n“No,” answered the engineer, “we are Americans.”\\n\\n“Ah!” said the stranger, and he murmured, “I prefer that!”\\n\\n“And you, my friend?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“English,” replied he hastily.\\n\\nAnd as if these few words had been difficult to say, he retreated to the\\nbeach, where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of\\nthe Mercy, in a state of extreme agitation.\\n\\nThen, passing one moment close to Herbert, he stopped and in a stifled\\nvoice,--\\n\\n“What month?” he asked.\\n\\n“December,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“What year?”\\n\\n“1866.”\\n\\n“Twelve years! twelve years!” he exclaimed.\\n\\nThen he left him abruptly.\\n\\nHerbert reported to the colonists the questions and answers which had\\nbeen made.\\n\\n“This unfortunate man,” observed Gideon Spilett, “was no longer\\nacquainted with either months or years!”\\n\\n“Yes!” added Herbert, “and he had been twelve years already on the islet\\nwhen we found him there!”\\n\\n“Twelve years!” rejoined Harding. “Ah! twelve years of solitude, after a\\nwicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man’s reason!”\\n\\n“I am induced to think,” said Pencroft, “that this man was not wrecked\\non Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he was left\\nthere.”\\n\\n“You must be right, Pencroft,” replied the reporter, “and if it is so\\nit is not impossible that those who left him on the island may return to\\nfetch him some day!”\\n\\n“And they will no longer find him,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“But then,” added Pencroft, “they must return, and--”\\n\\n“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, “do not let us discuss this question\\nuntil we know more about it. I believe that the unhappy man has\\nsuffered, that he has severely expiated his faults, whatever they may\\nhave been, and that the wish to unburden himself stifles him. Do not let\\nus press him to tell us his history! He will tell it to us doubtless,\\nand when we know it, we shall see what course it will be best to follow.\\nHe alone besides can tell us, if he has more than a hope, a certainty,\\nof returning some day to his country, but I doubt it!”\\n\\n“And why?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“Because that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered at a\\ncertain time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance and would\\nnot have thrown this document into the sea. No, it is more probable that\\nhe was condemned to die on that islet, and that he never expected to see\\nhis fellow-creatures again!”\\n\\n“But,” observed the sailor, “there is one thing which I cannot explain.”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“If this man had been left for twelve years on Tabor Island, one may\\nwell suppose that he had been several years already in the wild state in\\nwhich we found him!”\\n\\n“That is probable,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“It must then be many years since he wrote that document!”\\n\\n“No doubt,” and yet the document appears to have been recently written!\\n\\n“Besides, how do you know that the bottle which enclosed the document\\nmay not have taken several years to come from Tabor Island to Lincoln\\nIsland?”\\n\\n“That is not absolutely impossible,” replied the reporter.\\n\\n“Might it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?”\\n\\n“No,” answered Pencroft, “for it was still floating. We could not even\\nsuppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on the shore, it\\nwould have been swept off by the sea, for the south coast is all rocks,\\nand it would certainly have been smashed to pieces there!”\\n\\n“That is true,” rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.\\n\\n“And then,” continued the sailor, “if the document was several years\\nold, if it had been shut up in that bottle for several years, it would\\nhave been injured by damp. Now, there is nothing of the kind, and it was\\nfound in a perfect state of preservation.”\\n\\nThe sailor’s reasoning was very just, and pointed out an\\nincomprehensible fact, for the document appeared to have been recently\\nwritten, when the colonists found it in the bottle. Moreover, it gave\\nthe latitude and longitude of Tabor Island correctly, which implied that\\nits author had a more complete knowledge of hydrography than could be\\nexpected of a common sailor.\\n\\n“There is in this, again, something unaccountable,” said the engineer,\\n“but we will not urge our companion to speak. When he likes, my\\nfriends, then we shall be ready to hear him!”\\n\\nDuring the following days the stranger did not speak a word, and did not\\nonce leave the precincts of the plateau. He worked away, without losing\\na moment, without taking a minute’s rest, but always in a retired place.\\nAt meal times he never came to Granite House, although invited several\\ntimes to do so, but contented himself with eating a few raw vegetables.\\nAt nightfall he did not return to the room assigned to him, but remained\\nunder some clump of trees, or when the weather was bad crouched in some\\ncleft of the rocks. Thus he lived in the same manner as when he had no\\nother shelter than the forests of Tabor Island, and as all persuasion\\nto induce him to improve his life was in vain, the colonists\\nwaited patiently. And the time was near, when, as it seemed, almost\\ninvoluntarily urged by his conscience, a terrible confession escaped\\nhim.\\n\\nOn the 10th of November, about eight o’clock in the evening, as night\\nwas coming on, the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the settlers,\\nwho were assembled under the veranda. His eyes burned strangely, and he\\nhad quite resumed the wild aspect of his worst days.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions were astounded on seeing that, overcome\\nby some terrible emotion, his teeth chattered like those of a person\\nin a fever. What was the matter with him? Was the sight of his\\nfellow-creatures insupportable to him? Was he weary of this return to a\\ncivilized mode of existence? Was he pining for his former savage\\nlife? It appeared so, as soon he was heard to express himself in these\\nincoherent sentences:--\\n\\n“Why am I here?.... By what right have you dragged me from my islet?....\\nDo you think there could be any tie between you and me?.... Do you know\\nwho I am--what I have done--why I was there--alone? And who told\\nyou that I was not abandoned there--that I was not condemned to die\\nthere?.... Do you know my past?.... How do you know that I have not\\nstolen, murdered--that I am not a wretch--an accursed being--only fit to\\nlive like a wild beast, far from all--speak--do you know it?”\\n\\nThe colonists listened without interrupting the miserable creature, from\\nwhom these broken confessions escaped, as it were, in spite of himself.\\nHarding wishing to calm him, approached him, but he hastily drew back.\\n\\n“No! no!” he exclaimed; “one word only--am I free?”\\n\\n“You are free,” answered the engineer.\\n\\n“Farewell, then!” he cried, and fled like a madman.\\n\\nNeb, Pencroft, and Herbert ran also towards the edge of the wood--but\\nthey returned alone.\\n\\n“We must let him alone!” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“He will never come back!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\n“He will come back,” replied the engineer.\\n\\nMany days passed; but Harding--was it a sort of\\npresentiment?--persisted in the fixed idea that sooner or later the\\nunhappy man would return.\\n\\n“It is the last revolt of his wild nature,” said he, “which remorse has\\ntouched, and which renewed solitude will terrify.”\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, works of all sorts were continued, as well on Prospect\\nHeights as at the corral, where Harding intended to build a farm. It is\\nunnecessary to say that the seeds collected by Herbert on Tabor\\nIsland had been carefully sown. The plateau thus formed one immense\\nkitchen-garden, well laid out and carefully tended, so that the arms of\\nthe settlers were never in want of work. There was always something to\\nbe done. As the esculents increased in number, it became necessary to\\nenlarge the simple beds, which threatened to grow into regular fields\\nand replace the meadows. But grass abounded in other parts of the\\nisland, and there was no fear of the onagers being obliged to go on\\nshort allowance. It was well worth while, besides, to turn Prospect\\nHeights into a kitchen-garden, defended by its deep belt of creeks, and\\nto remove them to the meadows, which had no need of protection against\\nthe depredations of quadrumana and quadrapeds.\\n\\nOn the 15th of November, the third harvest was gathered in. How\\nwonderfully had the field increased in extent, since eighteen months\\nago, when the first grain of wheat was sown! The second crop of six\\nhundred thousand grains produced this time four thousand bushels, or\\nfive hundred millions of grains!\\n\\nThe colony was rich in corn, for ten bushels alone were sufficient for\\nsowing every year to produce an ample crop for the food both of men and\\nbeasts. The harvest was completed, and the last fortnight of the month\\nof November was devoted to the work of converting it into food for man.\\nIn fact, they had corn, but not flour, and the establishment of a mill\\nwas necessary. Cyrus Harding could have utilized the second fall which\\nflowed into the Mercy to establish his motive power, the first\\nbeing already occupied with moving the felting mill, but, after some\\nconsultation, it was decided that a simple windmill should be built on\\nProspect Heights. The building of this presented no more difficulty than\\nthe building of the former, and it was moreover certain that there would\\nbe no want of wind on the plateau, exposed as it was to the sea breezes.\\n\\n“Not to mention,” said Pencroft, “that the windmill will be more lively\\nand will have a good effect in the landscape!”\\n\\nThey set to work by choosing timber for the frame and machinery of the\\nmill. Some large stones, found at the north of the lake, could be easily\\ntransformed into millstones, and as to the sails, the inexhaustible case\\nof the balloon furnished the necessary material.\\n\\nCyrus Harding made his model, and the site of the mill was chosen a\\nlittle to the right of the poultry-yard, near the shore of the lake. The\\nframe was to rest on a pivot supported with strong timbers, so that it\\ncould turn with all the machinery it contained according as the wind\\nrequired it. The work advanced rapidly. Neb and Pencroft had become\\nvery skilful carpenters, and had nothing to do but to copy the models\\nprovided by the engineer.\\n\\nSoon a sort of cylindrical box, in shape like a pepper-pot, with a\\npointed roof, rose on the spot chosen. The four frames which formed the\\nsails had been firmly fixed in the center beam, so as to form a certain\\nangle with it, and secured with iron clamps. As to the different\\nparts of the internal mechanism, the box destined to contain the two\\nmillstones, the fixed stone and the moving stone, the hopper, a sort of\\nlarge square trough, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, which would\\nallow the grain to fall on the stones, the oscillating spout intended to\\nregulate the passing of the grain, and lastly the bolting machine, which\\nby the operation of sifting, separates the bran from the flour,\\nwere made without difficulty. The tools were good, and the work not\\ndifficult, for in reality, the machinery of a mill is very simple. This\\nwas only a question of time.\\n\\nEvery one had worked at the construction of the mill, and on the 1st\\nof December it was finished. As usual, Pencroft was delighted with his\\nwork, and had no doubt that the apparatus was perfect.\\n\\n“Now for a good wind,” said he, “and we shall grind our first harvest\\nsplendidly!”\\n\\n“A good wind, certainly,” answered the engineer, “but not too much,\\nPencroft.”\\n\\n“Pooh! our mill would only go the faster!”\\n\\n“There is no need for it to go so very fast,” replied Cyrus Harding. “It\\nis known by experience that the greatest quantity of work is performed\\nby a mill when the number of turns made by the sails in a minute is six\\ntimes the number of feet traversed by the wind in a second. A moderate\\nbreeze, which passes over twenty-four feet to the second, will give\\nsixteen turns to the sails during a minute, and there is no need of\\nmore.”\\n\\n“Exactly!” cried Herbert, “a fine breeze is blowing from the northeast,\\nwhich will soon do our business for us.”\\n\\nThere was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill, for the\\nsettlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in Lincoln Island.\\nOn this morning two or three bushels of wheat were ground, and the next\\nday at breakfast a magnificent loaf, a little heavy perhaps, although\\nraised with yeast, appeared on the table at Granite House. Every one\\nmunched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily understood.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared. Several times Gideon\\nSpilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite\\nHouse, without meeting or finding any trace of him. They became\\nseriously uneasy at this prolonged absence. Certainly, the former\\nsavage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest,\\nabounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his\\nhabits, and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts?\\nHowever, Harding, by a sort of presentiment, doubtless, always persisted\\nin saying that the fugitive would return.\\n\\n“Yes, he will return!” he repeated with a confidence which his\\ncompanions could not share. “When this unfortunate man was on Tabor\\nIsland, he knew himself to be alone! Here, he knows that fellow-men are\\nawaiting him! Since he has partially spoken of his past life, the poor\\npenitent will return to tell the whole, and from that day he will belong\\nto us!”\\n\\nThe event justified Cyrus Harding’s predictions. On the 3rd of December,\\nHerbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the southern bank of the\\nlake. He was unarmed, and till then had never taken any precautions for\\ndefense, as dangerous animals had not shown themselves on that part of\\nthe island.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry-yard, while\\nHarding and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in making soda,\\nthe store of soap being exhausted.\\n\\nSuddenly cries resounded,--\\n\\n“Help! help!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance, had not\\nbeen able to hear the shouts. Pencroft and Neb, leaving the poultry-yard\\nin all haste, rushed towards the lake.\\n\\nBut before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no one had\\nsuspected, crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the plateau from the\\nforest, and bounded up the opposite bank.\\n\\nHerbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to the\\none which had been killed on Reptile End. Suddenly surprised, he was\\nstanding with his back against a tree, while the animal gathering itself\\ntogether was about to spring.\\n\\nBut the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on the\\nformidable animal, who turned to meet this new adversary.\\n\\nThe struggle was short. The stranger possessed immense strength and\\nactivity. He seized the jaguar’s throat with one powerful hand, holding\\nit as in a vise, without heeding the beast’s claws which tore his flesh,\\nand with the other he plunged his knife into its heart.\\n\\nThe jaguar fell. The stranger kicked away the body, and was about to\\nfly at the moment when the settlers arrived on the field of battle, but\\nHerbert, clinging to him, cried,--\\n\\n“No, no! you shall not go!”\\n\\nHarding advanced towards the stranger, who frowned when he saw him\\napproaching. The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt,\\nbut he took no notice of it.\\n\\n“My friend,” said Cyrus Harding, “we have just contracted a debt of\\ngratitude to you. To save our boy you have risked your life!”\\n\\n“My life!” murmured the stranger. “What is that worth? Less than\\nnothing!”\\n\\n“You are wounded?”\\n\\n“It is no matter.”\\n\\n“Will you give me your hand?”\\n\\nAnd as Herbert endeavored to seize the hand which had just saved him,\\nthe stranger folded his arms, his chest heaved, his look darkened, and\\nhe appeared to wish to escape, but making a violent effort over himself,\\nand in an abrupt tone,--\\n\\n“Who are you?” he asked, “and what do you claim to be to me?”\\n\\nIt was the colonists’ history which he thus demanded, and for the first\\ntime. Perhaps this history recounted, he would tell his own.\\n\\nIn a few words Harding related all that had happened since their\\ndeparture from Richmond; how they had managed, and what resources they\\nnow had at their disposal.\\n\\nThe stranger listened with extreme attention.\\n\\nThen the engineer told who they all were, Gideon Spilett, Herbert,\\nPencroft, Neb, himself, and, he added, that the greatest happiness they\\nhad felt since their arrival in Lincoln Island was on the return of the\\nvessel from Tabor Island, when they had been able to include among them\\na new companion.\\n\\nAt these words the stranger’s face flushed, his head sunk on his breast,\\nand confusion was depicted on his countenance.\\n\\n“And now that you know us,” added Cyrus Harding, “will you give us your\\nhand?”\\n\\n“No,” replied the stranger in a hoarse voice; “no! You are honest men!\\nAnd I--”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\nThese last words justified the colonists’ presentiment. There had been\\nsome mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men, but from which\\nhis conscience had not yet absolved him. At any rate the guilty man felt\\nremorse, he repented, and his new friends would have cordially pressed\\nthe hand which they sought; but he did not feel himself worthy to extend\\nit to honest men! However, after the scene with the jaguar, he did not\\nreturn to the forest, and from that day did not go beyond the enclosure\\nof Granite House.\\n\\nWhat was the mystery of his life? Would the stranger one day speak of\\nit? Time alone could show. At any rate, it was agreed that his secret\\nshould never be asked from him, and that they would live with him as if\\nthey suspected nothing.\\n\\nFor some days their life continued as before. Cyrus Harding and Gideon\\nSpilett worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes experimentalists.\\nThe reporter never left the engineer except to hunt with Herbert, for\\nit would not have been prudent to allow the lad to ramble alone in the\\nforest; and it was very necessary to be on their guard. As to Neb\\nand Pencroft, one day at the stables and poultry-yard, another at the\\ncorral, without reckoning work in Granite House, they were never in want\\nof employment.\\n\\nThe stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life, never\\nappearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau, never\\nmingling with his companions. It really seemed as if the society of\\nthose who had saved him was insupportable to him!\\n\\n“But then,” observed Pencroft, “why did he entreat the help of his\\nfellow-creatures? Why did he throw that paper into the sea?”\\n\\n“He will tell us why,” invariably replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“When?”\\n\\n“Perhaps sooner than you think, Pencroft.”\\n\\nAnd, indeed, the day of confession was near.\\n\\nOn the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House,\\nHarding saw the stranger approaching, who, in a calm voice and humble\\ntone, said to him: “Sir, I have a request to make of you.”\\n\\n“Speak,” answered the engineer, “but first let me ask you a question.”\\n\\nAt these words the stranger reddened, and was on the point of\\nwithdrawing. Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in the mind of\\nthe guilty man, who doubtless feared that the engineer would interrogate\\nhim on his past life.\\n\\nHarding held him back.\\n\\n“Comrade,” said he, “we are not only your companions but your friends. I\\nwish you to believe that, and now I will listen to you.”\\n\\nThe stranger pressed his hand over his eyes. He was seized with a\\nsort of trembling, and remained a few moments without being able to\\narticulate a word.\\n\\n“Sir,” said he at last, “I have come to beg you to grant me a favor.”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“You have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your domesticated\\nanimals. These animals need to be taken care of. Will you allow me to\\nlive there with them?”\\n\\nCyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments with a\\nfeeling of deep commiseration; then,--\\n\\n\\n“My friend,” said he, “the corral has only stables hardly fit for\\nanimals.”\\n\\n“It will be good enough for me, sir.”\\n\\n“My friend,” answered Harding, “we will not constrain you in anything.\\nYou wish to live at the corral, so be it. You will, however, be always\\nwelcome at Granite House. But since you wish to live at the corral\\nwe will make the necessary arrangements for your being comfortably\\nestablished there.”\\n\\n“Never mind that, I shall do very well.”\\n\\n“My friend,” answered Harding, who always intentionally made use of this\\ncordial appellation, “you must let us judge what it will be best to do\\nin this respect.”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir,” replied the stranger as he withdrew.\\n\\nThe engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had\\nbeen made to him, and it was agreed that they should build a wooden\\nhouse at the corral, which they would make as comfortable as possible.\\n\\nThat very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the necessary\\ntools, and a week had not passed before the house was ready to receive\\nits tenant. It was built about twenty feet from the sheds, and from\\nthere it was easy to overlook the flock of sheep, which then numbered\\nmore than eighty. Some furniture, a bed, table, bench, cupboard, and\\nchest were manufactured, and a gun, ammunition, and tools were carried\\nto the corral.\\n\\nThe stranger, however, had seen nothing of his new dwelling, and he\\nhad allowed the settlers to work there without him, while he occupied\\nhimself on the plateau, wishing, doubtless, to put the finishing stroke\\nto his work. Indeed, thanks to him, all the ground was dug up and ready\\nto be sowed when the time came.\\n\\nIt was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral\\nwere completed. The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling\\nwas ready to receive him, and the latter replied that he would go and\\nsleep there that very evening.\\n\\nOn this evening the colonists were gathered in the diningroom of Granite\\nHouse. It was then eight o’clock, the hour at which their companion was\\nto leave them. Not wishing to trouble him by their presence, and thus\\nimposing on him the necessity of saying farewells which might perhaps be\\npainful to him, they had left him alone and ascended to Granite House.\\n\\nNow, they had been talking in the room for a few minutes, when a light\\nknock was heard at the door. Almost immediately the stranger entered,\\nand without any preamble,--\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “before I leave you, it is right that you should\\nknow my history. I will tell it you.”\\n\\nThese simple words profoundly impressed Cyrus Harding and his\\ncompanions. The engineer rose.\\n\\n“We ask you nothing, my friend,” said he; “it is your right to be\\nsilent.”\\n\\n“It is my duty to speak.”\\n\\n“Sit down, then.”\\n\\n“No, I will stand.”\\n\\n“We are ready to hear you,” replied Harding.\\n\\nThe stranger remained standing in a corner of the room, a little in the\\nshade. He was bareheaded, his arms folded across his chest, and it\\nwas in this posture that in a hoarse voice, speaking like some one\\nwho obliges himself to speak, he gave the following recital, which his\\nauditors did not once interrupt:--\\n\\n“On the 20th of December, 1854, a steam-yacht, belonging to a Scotch\\nnobleman, Lord Glenarvan, anchored off Cape Bernouilli, on the western\\ncoast of Australia, in the thirty-seventh parallel. On board this yacht\\nwere Lord Glenarvan and his wife, a major in the English army, a French\\ngeographer, a young girl, and a young boy. These two last were the\\nchildren of Captain Grant, whose ship, the ‘Britannia,’ had been lost,\\ncrew and cargo, a year before. The ‘Duncan’ was commanded by Captain\\nJohn Mangles, and manned by a crew of fifteen men.\\n\\n“This is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of\\nAustralia. Six months before, a bottle, enclosing a document written in\\nEnglish, German, and French, had been found in the Irish Sea, and picked\\nup by the ‘Duncan.’ This document stated in substance that there still\\nexisted three survivors from the wreck of the ‘Britannia,’ that these\\nsurvivors were Captain Grant and two of his men, and that they had found\\nrefuge on some land, of which the document gave the latitude, but of\\nwhich the longitude, effaced by the sea, was no longer legible.\\n\\n“This latitude was 37deg 11’ south; therefore, the longitude being\\nunknown, if they followed the thirty-seventh parallel over continents\\nand seas, they would be certain to reach the spot inhabited by Captain\\nGrant and his two companions. The English Admiralty having hesitated to\\nundertake this search, Lord Glenarvan resolved to attempt everything to\\nfind the captain. He communicated with Mary and Robert Grant, who joined\\nhim. The ‘Duncan’ yacht was equipped for the distant voyage, in which\\nthe nobleman’s family and the captain’s children wished to take part,\\nand the ‘Duncan,’ leaving Glasgow, proceeded towards the Atlantic,\\npassed through the Straits of Magellan, and ascended the Pacific as\\nfar as Patagonia, where, according to a previous interpretation of the\\ndocument, they supposed that Captain Grant was a prisoner among the\\nIndians.\\n\\n“The ‘Duncan’ disembarked her passengers on the western coast of\\nPatagonia, and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at\\nCape Corrientes. Lord Glenarvan traversed Patagonia, following the\\nthirty-seventh parallel, and having found no trace of the captain, he\\nre-embarked on the 13th of November, so as to pursue his search through\\nthe Ocean.\\n\\n“After having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan d’Acunha and\\nAmsterdam, situated in her course, the ‘Duncan,’ as I have said, arrived\\nat Cape Bernouilli, on the Australian coast, on the 20th of December,\\n1854.\\n\\n“It was Lord Glenarvan’s intention to traverse Australia as he had\\ntraversed America, and he disembarked. A few miles from the coast was\\nestablished a farm, belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to\\nthe travelers. Lord Glenarvan made known to the Irishman the cause\\nwhich had brought him to these parts, and asked if he knew whether a\\nthree-masted English vessel, the ‘Britannia,’ had been lost less than\\ntwo years before on the west coast of Australia.\\n\\n“The Irishman had never heard of this wreck, but, to the great surprise\\nof the bystanders, one of his servants came forward and said,--\\n\\n“‘My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is still living, he is\\nliving on the Australian shores.’\\n\\n“‘Who are you?’ asked Lord Glenarvan.\\n\\n“‘A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,’ replied the man; ‘I am one of\\nCaptain Grant’s crew--one of the castaways of the “Britannia.’”\\n\\n“This man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the boatswain’s mate of\\nthe ‘Britannia,’ as his papers showed. But, separated from Captain Grant\\nat the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he had till then\\nbelieved that the captain with all his crew had perished, and that he,\\nAyrton, was the sole survivor of the ‘Britannia.’\\n\\n“‘Only,’ he added, ‘it was not on the west coast, but on the east coast\\nof Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain Grant is still\\nliving, as his document indicates, he is a prisoner among the natives,\\nand it is on the other coast that he must be looked for.’\\n\\n“This man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his words\\ncould not be doubted. The Irishman, in whose service he had been for\\nmore than a year, answered for his trustworthiness. Lord Glenarvan,\\ntherefore, believed in the fidelity of this man and, by his advice,\\nresolved to cross Australia, following the thirty-seventh parallel. Lord\\nGlenarvan, his wife, the two children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain\\nMangles, and a few sailors composed the little band under the command\\nof Ayrton, while the ‘Duncan,’ under charge of the mate, Tom Austin,\\nproceeded to Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan’s instructions.\\n\\n“They set out on the 23rd of December, 1854.\\n\\n“It is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed, the\\nboatswain’s mate of the ‘Britannia,’ but, after some dispute with his\\ncaptain, he endeavored to incite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship,\\nand Captain Grant had landed him, on the 8th of April, 1852, on the\\nwest coast of Australia, and then sailed, leaving him there, as was only\\njust.\\n\\n“Therefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the\\n‘Britannia’; he had just heard of it from Glenarvan’s account. Since his\\nabandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of\\nthe escaped convicts; and if he boldly maintained that the wreck had\\ntaken place on the east coast, and led Lord Glenarvan to proceed in that\\ndirection, it was that he hoped to separate him from his ship, seize the\\n‘Duncan,’ and make the yacht a pirate in the Pacific.”\\n\\nHere the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but he\\ncontinued,--\\n\\n“The expedition set out and proceeded across Australia. It was\\ninevitably unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be\\ncalled, guided it, sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his band of\\nconvicts, who had been told what they had to do.\\n\\n“Meanwhile, the ‘Duncan’ had been sent to Melbourne for repairs. It was\\nnecessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave Melbourne\\nand go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be easy to seize\\nher. After having led the expedition near enough to the coast, in the\\nmidst of vast forests with no resources, Ayrton obtained a letter, which\\nhe was charged to carry to the mate of the ‘Duncan’--a letter which\\nordered the yacht to repair immediately to the east coast, to Twofold\\nBay, that is to say a few days’ journey from the place where the\\nexpedition had stopped. It was there that Ayrton had agreed to meet his\\naccomplices, and two days after gaining possession of the letter, he\\narrived at Melbourne.\\n\\n“So far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design. He would be able\\nto take the ‘Duncan’ into Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the\\nconvicts to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would become\\nmaster of the seas. But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of\\nthese terrible projects.\\n\\n“Ayrton, arrived at Melbourne, delivered the letter to the mate, Tom\\nAustin, who read it and immediately set sail, but judge of Ayrton’s rage\\nand disappointment, when the next day he found that the mate was taking\\nthe vessel, not to the east coast of Australia, to Twofold Bay, but to\\nthe east coast of New Zealand. He wished to stop him, but Austin showed\\nhim the letter!... And indeed, by a providential error of the French\\ngeographer, who had written the letter, the east coast of New Zealand\\nwas mentioned as the place of destination.\\n\\n“All Ayrton’s plans were frustrated! He became outrageous. They put him\\nin irons. He was then taken to the coast of New Zealand, not knowing\\nwhat would become of his accomplices, or what would become of Lord\\nGlenarvan.\\n\\n“The ‘Duncan’ cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March. On\\nthat day Ayrton heard the report of guns. The guns on the ‘Duncan’ were\\nbeing fired, and soon Lord Glenarvan and his companions came on board.\\n\\n“This is what had happened.\\n\\n“After a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had\\naccomplished his journey, and arrived on the east coast of Australia, at\\nTwofold Bay. ‘No “Duncan!”’ He telegraphed to Melbourne. They answered,\\n“Duncan” sailed on the 18th instant. Destination unknown.’\\n\\n“Lord Glenarvan could only arrive at one conclusion; that his honest\\nyacht had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a pirate\\nvessel!\\n\\n“However, Lord Glenarvan would not give up. He was a bold and generous\\nman. He embarked in a merchant vessel, sailed to the west coast of New\\nZealand, traversed it along the thirty-seventh parallel, without\\nfinding any trace of Captain Grant; but on the other side, to his\\ngreat surprise, and by the will of Heaven, he found the ‘Duncan,’ under\\ncommand of the mate, who had been waiting for him for five weeks!\\n\\n“This was on the 3rd of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was now on board the\\n‘Duncan,’ but Ayrton was there also. He appeared before the nobleman,\\nwho wished to extract from him all that the villain knew about Captain\\nGrant. Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan then told him, that at\\nthe first port they put into, he would be delivered up to the English\\nauthorities. Ayrton remained mute.\\n\\n“The ‘Duncan’ continued her voyage along the thirty-seventh parallel.\\nIn the meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to vanquish the resistance of\\nthe ruffian.\\n\\n“At last, her influence prevailed, and Ayrton, in exchange for what he\\ncould tell, proposed that Lord Glenarvan should leave him on some island\\nin the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English authorities.\\nLord Glenarvan, resolving to do anything to obtain information about\\nCaptain Grant, consented.\\n\\n“Ayrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he knew\\nnothing from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on the\\nAustralian coast.\\n\\n“Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had given. The\\n‘Duncan’ continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor Island. It was there\\nthat Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there also that, by a\\nveritable miracle, they found Captain Grant and two men, exactly on the\\nthirty-seventh parallel.\\n\\n“The convict, then, went to take their place on this desert islet, and\\nat the moment he left the yacht these words were pronounced by Lord\\nGlenarvan:--\\n\\n“‘Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any possible\\ncommunication with your fellow-creatures. You cannot escape from this\\nislet on which the ‘Duncan’ leaves you. You will be alone, under the eye\\nof a God who reads the depths of the heart, but you will be neither\\nlost nor forgotten, as was Captain Grant. Unworthy as you are to be\\nremembered by men, men will remember you. I know where you are Ayrton,\\nand I know where to find you. I will never forget it!\\n\\n“And the ‘Duncan,’ making sail, soon disappeared. This was 18th of\\nMarch, 1855.\\n\\n     (The events which have just been briefly related are taken\\n     from a work which some of our readers have no doubt read,\\n     and which is entitled, “Captain Grant’s children.” They will\\n     remark on this occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy\\n     in the dates; but later again, they will understand why the\\n     real dates were not at first given.)\\n\\n“Ayrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition, weapons,\\ntools, or seeds.\\n\\n“At his, the convict’s disposal, was the house built by honest Captain\\nGrant. He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he\\nhad committed.\\n\\n“Gentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was very\\nmiserable! He said to himself, that if men came some day to take\\nhim from that islet, he must be worthy to return among them! How he\\nsuffered, that wretched man! How he labored to recover himself by work!\\nHow he prayed to be reformed by prayer! For two years, three years, this\\nwent on, but Ayrton, humbled by solitude, always looking for some ship\\nto appear on the horizon, asking himself if the time of expiation would\\nsoon be complete, suffered as none other suffered! Oh! how dreadful was\\nthis solitude, to a heart tormented by remorse!\\n\\n“But doubtless Heaven had not sufficiently punished this unhappy man,\\nfor he felt that he was gradually becoming a savage! He felt that\\nbrutishness was gradually gaining on him!\\n\\n“He could not say if it was after two or three years of solitude, but at\\nlast he became the miserable creature you found!\\n\\n“I have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce, and I,\\nare the same.”\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions rose at the end of this account. It\\nis impossible to say how much they were moved! What misery, grief, and\\ndespair lay revealed before them!\\n\\n“Ayrton,” said Harding, rising, “you have been a great criminal, but\\nHeaven must certainly think that you have expiated your crimes! That\\nhas been proved by your having been brought again among your\\nfellow-creatures. Ayrton, you are forgiven! And now you will be our\\ncompanion?”\\n\\nAyrton drew back.\\n\\n“Here is my hand!” said the engineer.\\n\\nAyrton grasped the hand which Harding extended to him, and great tears\\nfell from his eyes.\\n\\n“Will you live with us?” asked Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Captain Harding, leave me some time longer,” replied Ayrton, “leave me\\nalone in the hut in the corral!”\\n\\n“As you like, Ayrton,” answered Cyrus Harding. Ayrton was going to\\nwithdraw, when the engineer addressed one more question to him:--\\n\\n“One word more, my friend. Since it was your intention to live alone,\\nwhy did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?”\\n\\n“A document?” repeated Ayrton, who did not appear to know what he meant.\\n\\n“Yes, the document which we found enclosed in a bottle, giving us the\\nexact position of Tabor Island!”\\n\\nAyrton passed his hand over his brow, then after having thought, “I\\nnever threw any document into the sea!” he answered.\\n\\n“Never?” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\n“Never!”\\n\\nAnd Ayrton, bowing, reached the door and departed.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n“Poor man!” said Herbert, who had rushed to the door, but returned,\\nhaving seen Ayrton slide down the rope on the lift and disappear in the\\ndarkness.\\n\\n“He will come back,” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Come, now, captain,” exclaimed Pencroft, “what does that mean? What!\\nwasn’t it Ayrton who threw that bottle into the sea? Who was it then?”\\n\\nCertainly, if ever a question was necessary to be made, it was that one!\\n\\n“It was he,” answered Neb, “only the unhappy man was half-mad.”\\n\\n“Yes!” said Herbert, “and he was no longer conscious of what he was\\ndoing.”\\n\\n“It can only be explained in that way, my friends,” replied Harding\\nquickly, “and I understand now how Ayrton was able to point out exactly\\nthe situation of Tabor Island, since the events which had preceded his\\nbeing left on the island had made it known to him.”\\n\\n“However,” observed Pencroft, “if he was not yet a brute when he wrote\\nthat document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight years ago,\\nhow is it that the paper has not been injured by damp?”\\n\\n“That proves,” answered Cyrus Harding, “that Ayrton was deprived of\\nintelligence at a more recent time than he thinks.”\\n\\n“Of course it must be so,” replied Pencroft, “without that the fact\\nwould be unaccountable.”\\n\\n“Unaccountable indeed,” answered the engineer, who did not appear\\ndesirous to prolong the conversation.\\n\\n“But has Ayrton told the truth?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied the reporter. “The story which he has told is true in\\nevery point. I remember quite well the account in the newspapers of the\\nyacht expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan, and its result.”\\n\\n“Ayrton has told the truth,” added Harding. “Do not doubt it, Pencroft,\\nfor it was painful to him. People tell the truth when they accuse\\nthemselves like that!”\\n\\nThe next day--the 21st of December--the colonists descended to the\\nbeach, and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton. He\\nhad reached his house in the corral during the night and the settlers\\njudged it best not to agitate him by their presence. Time would\\ndoubtless perform what sympathy had been unable to accomplish.\\n\\nHerbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations. On this\\nday the same work brought Harding and the reporter to the workshop at\\nthe Chimneys.\\n\\n“Do you know, my dear Cyrus,” said Gideon Spilett, “that the explanation\\nyou gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied me at\\nall! How can it be supposed that the unfortunate man was able to write\\nthat document and throw the bottle into the sea without having the\\nslightest recollection of it?”\\n\\n“Nor was it he who threw it in, my dear Spilett.”\\n\\n“You think then--”\\n\\n“I think nothing, I know nothing!” interrupted Cyrus Harding. “I am\\ncontent to rank this incident among those which I have not been able to\\nexplain to this day!”\\n\\n“Indeed, Cyrus,” said Spilett, “these things are incredible! Your\\nrescue, the case stranded on the sand, Top’s adventure, and lastly this\\nbottle... Shall we never have the answer to these enigmas?”\\n\\n“Yes!” replied the engineer quickly, “yes, even if I have to penetrate\\ninto the bowels of this island!”\\n\\n“Chance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery!”\\n\\n“Chance! Spilett! I do not believe in chance, any more than I believe in\\nmysteries in this world. There is a reason for everything unaccountable\\nwhich has happened here, and that reason I shall discover. But in the\\nmeantime we must work and observe.”\\n\\nThe month of January arrived. The year 1867 commenced. The summer\\noccupations were assiduously continued. During the days which followed,\\nHerbert and Spilett having gone in the direction of the corral,\\nascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of the habitation which\\nhad been prepared for him. He busied himself with the numerous flock\\nconfided to his care, and spared his companions the trouble of coming\\nevery two or three days to visit the corral. Nevertheless, in order not\\nto leave Ayrton in solitude for too long a time, the settlers often paid\\nhim a visit.\\n\\nIt was not unimportant either, in consequence of some suspicions\\nentertained by the engineer and Gideon Spilett, that this part of\\nthe island should be subject to a surveillance of some sort, and that\\nAyrton, if any incident occurred unexpectedly, should not neglect to\\ninform the inhabitants of Granite House of it.\\n\\nNevertheless it might happen that something would occur which it would\\nbe necessary to bring rapidly to the engineer’s knowledge. Independently\\nof facts bearing on the mystery of Lincoln Island, many others\\nmight happen, which would call for the prompt interference of the\\ncolonists,--such as the sighting of a vessel, a wreck on the western\\ncoast, the possible arrival of pirates, etc.\\n\\nTherefore Cyrus Harding resolved to put the corral in instantaneous\\ncommunication with Granite House.\\n\\nIt was on the 10th of January that he made known his project to his\\ncompanions.\\n\\n“Why! how are you going to manage that, captain?” asked Pencroft. “Do\\nyou by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?”\\n\\n“Exactly so,” answered the engineer.\\n\\n“Electric?” cried Herbert.\\n\\n“Electric,” replied Cyrus Harding. “We have all the necessary materials\\nfor making a battery, and the most difficult thing will be to stretch\\nthe wires, but by means of a drawplate I think we shall manage it.”\\n\\n“Well, after that,” returned the sailor, “I shall never despair of\\nseeing ourselves some day rolling along on a railway!”\\n\\nThey then set to work, beginning with the most difficult thing, for, if\\nthey failed in that, it would be useless to manufacture the battery and\\nother accessories.\\n\\nThe iron of Lincoln Island, as has been said, was of excellent quality,\\nand consequently very fit for being drawn out. Harding commenced by\\nmanufacturing a drawplate, that is to say, a plate of steel, pierced\\nwith conical holes of different sizes, which would successively bring\\nthe wire to the wished-for tenacity. This piece of steel, after having\\nbeen tempered, was fixed in as firm a way as possible in a solid\\nframework planted in the ground, only a few feet from the great fall,\\nthe motive power of which the engineer intended to utilize. In fact as\\nthe fulling-mill was there, although not then in use, its beam moved\\nwith extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it\\nround itself. It was a delicate operation, and required much care. The\\niron, prepared previously in long thin rods, the ends of which were\\nsharpened with the file, having been introduced into the largest hole of\\nthe drawplate, was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself,\\nto a length of twenty-five or thirty feet, then unrolled, and the same\\noperation was performed successively through the holes of a less size.\\nFinally, the engineer obtained wires from forty to fifty feet long,\\nwhich could be easily fastened together and stretched over the distance\\nof five miles, which separated the corral from the bounds of Granite\\nHouse.\\n\\nIt did not take more than a few days to perform this work, and indeed\\nas soon as the machine had been commenced, Cyrus Harding left his\\ncompanions to follow the trade of wiredrawers, and occupied himself with\\nmanufacturing his battery.\\n\\nIt was necessary to obtain a battery with a constant current. It is\\nknown that the elements of modern batteries are generally composed of\\nretort coal, zinc, and copper. Copper was absolutely wanting to the\\nengineer, who, notwithstanding all his researches, had never been able\\nto find any trace of it in Lincoln Island, and was therefore obliged to\\ndo without it. Retort coal, that is to say, the hard graphite which\\nis found in the retorts of gas manufactories, after the coal has\\nbeen dehydrogenized, could have been obtained, but it would have been\\nnecessary to establish a special apparatus, involving great labor. As\\nto zinc, it may be remembered that the case found at Flotsam Point was\\nlined with this metal, which could not be better utilized than for this\\npurpose.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, after mature consideration, decided to manufacture a\\nvery simple battery, resembling as nearly as possible that invented\\nby Becquerel in 1820, and in which zinc only is employed. The other\\nsubstances, azotic acid and potash, were all at his disposal.\\n\\nThe way in which the battery was composed was as follows, and the\\nresults were to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash on each\\nother. A number of glass bottles were made and filled with azotic acid.\\nThe engineer corked them by means of a stopper through which passed a\\nglass tube, bored at its lower extremity, and intended to be plunged\\ninto the acid by means of a clay stopper secured by a rag. Into this\\ntube, through its upper extremity, he poured a solution of potash,\\npreviously obtained by burning and reducing to ashes various plants,\\nand in this way the acid and potash could act on each other through the\\nclay.\\n\\nCyrus Harding then took two slips of zinc, one of which was plunged\\ninto azotic acid, the other into a solution of potash. A current was\\nimmediately produced, which was transmitted from the slip of zinc in the\\nbottle to that in the tube, and the two slips having been connected by a\\nmetallic wire the slip in the tube became the positive pole, and that in\\nthe bottle the negative pole of the apparatus. Each bottle, therefore,\\nproduced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all\\nthe phenomena of the electric telegraph. Such was the ingenious and very\\nsimple apparatus constructed by Cyrus Harding, an apparatus which would\\nallow them to establish a telegraphic communication between Granite\\nHouse and the corral.\\n\\nOn the 6th of February was commenced the planting along the road to\\nthe corral, of posts furnished with glass insulators, and intended to\\nsupport the wire. A few days after, the wire was extended, ready to\\nproduce the electric current at a rate of twenty thousand miles a\\nsecond.\\n\\nTwo batteries had been manufactured, one for Granite House, the other\\nfor the corral; for if it was necessary the corral should be able to\\ncommunicate with Granite House it might also be useful that Granite\\nHouse should be able to communicate with the corral.\\n\\nAs to the receiver and manipulator, they were very simple. At the two\\nstations the wire was wound round a magnet, that is to say, round a\\npiece of soft iron surrounded with a wire. The communication was thus\\nestablished between the two poles; the current, starting from the\\npositive pole, traversed the wire, passed through the magnet which was\\ntemporarily magnetized, and returned through the earth to the negative\\npole. If the current was interrupted, the magnet immediately became\\nunmagnetized. It was sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the\\nmagnet, which, attracted during the passage of the current, would fall\\nback when the current was interrupted. This movement of the plate thus\\nobtained, Harding could easily fasten to it a needle arranged on a dial,\\nbearing the letters of the alphabet, and in this way communicate from\\none station to the other.\\n\\nAll was completely arranged by the 12th of February. On this day,\\nHarding, having sent the current through the wire, asked if all\\nwas going on well at the corral, and received in a few moments a\\nsatisfactory reply from Ayrton. Pencroft was wild with joy, and every\\nmorning and evening he sent a telegram to the corral, which always\\nreceived an answer.\\n\\nThis mode of communication presented two very real advantages: firstly,\\nbecause it enabled them to ascertain that Ayrton was at the corral; and\\nsecondly, that he was thus not left completely isolated. Besides, Cyrus\\nHarding never allowed a week to pass without going to see him, and\\nAyrton came from time to time to Granite House, where he always found a\\ncordial welcome.\\n\\nThe fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work. The\\nresources of the colony, particularly in vegetables and corn, increased\\nfrom day to day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island had succeeded\\nperfectly.\\n\\nThe plateau of Prospect Heights presented an encouraging aspect. The\\nfourth harvest had been admirable and it may be supposed that no one\\nthought of counting whether the four hundred thousand millions of grains\\nduly appeared in the crop. However, Pencroft had thought of doing so,\\nbut Cyrus Harding having told him that even if he managed to count three\\nhundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an hour, it would take him\\nnearly five thousand five-hundred years to finish his task, the honest\\nsailor considered it best to give up the idea.\\n\\nThe weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day time, but\\nin the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and\\nprocured cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite House. There were,\\nhowever, a few storms, which, although they were not of long duration,\\nswept over Lincoln Island with extraordinary fury. The lightning blazed\\nand the thunder continued to roll for some hours.\\n\\nAt this period the little colony was extremely prosperous.\\n\\nThe tenants of the poultry-yard swarmed, and they lived on the surplus,\\nbut it became necessary to reduce the population to a more moderate\\nnumber. The pigs had already produced young, and it may be understood\\nthat their care for these animals absorbed a great part of Neb and\\nPencroft’s time. The onagers, who had two pretty colts, were most often\\nmounted by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, who had become an excellent rider\\nunder the reporter’s instruction, and they also harnessed them to the\\ncart either for carrying wood and coal to Granite House, or different\\nmineral productions required by the engineer.\\n\\nSeveral expeditions were made about this time into the depths of the Far\\nWest Forests. The explorers could venture there without having anything\\nto fear from the heat, for the sun’s rays scarcely penetrated through\\nthe thick foliage spreading above their heads. They thus visited all the\\nleft bank of the Mercy, along which ran the road from the corral to the\\nmouth of Falls River.\\n\\nBut in these excursions the settlers took care to be well armed, for\\nthey met with savage wild boars, with which they often had a tussle.\\nThey also, during this season, made fierce war against the jaguars.\\nGideon Spilett had vowed a special hatred against them, and his pupil\\nHerbert seconded him well. Armed as they were, they no longer feared\\nto meet one of those beasts. Herbert’s courage was superb, and the\\nreporter’s sang-froid astonishing. Already twenty magnificent skins\\nornamented the dining-room of Granite House, and if this continued, the\\njaguar race would soon be extinct in the island, the object aimed at by\\nthe hunters.\\n\\nThe engineer sometimes took part in the expeditions made to the unknown\\nparts of the island, which he surveyed with great attention. It was for\\nother traces than those of animals that he searched the thickets of the\\nvast forest, but nothing suspicious ever appeared. Neither Top nor Jup,\\nwho accompanied him, ever betrayed by their behavior that there was\\nanything strange there, and yet more than once again the dog barked at\\nthe mouth of the well, which the engineer had before explored without\\nresult.\\n\\nAt this time Gideon Spilett, aided by Herbert, took several views of\\nthe most picturesque parts of the island, by means of the photographic\\napparatus found in the cases, and of which they had not as yet made any\\nuse.\\n\\nThis apparatus, provided with a powerful object-glass, was very\\ncomplete. Substances necessary for the photographic reproduction,\\ncollodion for preparing the glass plate, nitrate of silver to render it\\nsensitive, hyposulfate of soda to fix the prints obtained, chloride of\\nammonium in which to soak the paper destined to give the positive proof,\\nacetate of soda and chloride of gold in which to immerse the paper,\\nnothing was wanting. Even the papers were there, all prepared,\\nand before laying in the printing-frame upon the negatives, it was\\nsufficient to soak them for a few minutes in the solution of nitrate of\\nsilver.\\n\\nThe reporter and his assistant became in a short time very skilful\\noperators, and they obtained fine views of the country, such as the\\nisland, taken from Prospect Heights with Mount Franklin in the distance,\\nthe mouth of the Mercy, so picturesquely framed in high rocks, the glade\\nand the corral, with the spurs of the mountain in the background, the\\ncurious development of Claw Cape, Flotsam Point, etc.\\n\\nNor did the photographers forget to take the portraits of all the\\ninhabitants of the island, leaving out no one.\\n\\n“It multiplies us,” said Pencroft.\\n\\nAnd the sailor was enchanted to see his own countenance, faithfully\\nreproduced, ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stopped\\nas willingly before this exhibition as he would have done before the\\nrichest shop-windows in Broadway.\\n\\nBut it must be acknowledged that the most successful portrait was\\nincontestably that of Master Jup. Master Jup had sat with a gravity not\\nto be described, and his portrait was lifelike!\\n\\n“He looks as if he was just going to grin!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\nAnd if Master Jup had not been satisfied, he would have been very\\ndifficult to please; but he was quite contented and contemplated his own\\ncountenance with a sentimental air which expressed some small amount of\\nconceit.\\n\\nThe summer heat ended with the month of March. The weather was sometimes\\nrainy, but still warm. The month of March, which corresponds to the\\nSeptember of northern latitudes, was not so fine as might have been\\nhoped. Perhaps it announced an early and rigorous winter.\\n\\nIt might have been supposed one morning--the 21 st--that the first snow\\nhad already made its appearance. In fact Herbert looking early from one\\nof the windows of Granite House, exclaimed,--\\n\\n“Hallo! the islet is covered with snow!”\\n\\n“Snow at this time?” answered the reporter, joining the boy.\\n\\nTheir companions were soon beside them, but could only ascertain one\\nthing, that not only the islet but all the beach below Granite House was\\ncovered with one uniform sheet of white.\\n\\n“It must be snow!” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“Or rather it’s very like it!” replied Neb.\\n\\n“But the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees!” observed Gideon\\nSpilett.\\n\\nCyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying anything, for\\nhe really did not know how to explain this phenomenon, at this time of\\nyear and in such a temperature.\\n\\n“By Jove!” exclaimed Pencroft, “all our plants will be frozen!”\\n\\nAnd the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the nimble\\nJup, who slid down to the sand.\\n\\nBut the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet arose and\\ndispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the\\nsun was obscured for some minutes.\\n\\n“Birds!” cried Herbert.\\n\\nThey were indeed swarms of sea-birds, with dazzling white plumage.\\nThey had perched by thousands on the islet and on the shore, and they\\ndisappeared in the distance, leaving the colonists amazed as if they\\nhad been present at some transformation scene, in which summer succeeded\\nwinter at the touch of a fairy’s wand. Unfortunately the change had been\\nso sudden, that neither the reporter nor the lad had been able to bring\\ndown one of these birds, of which they could not recognize the species.\\n\\nA few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two years\\nbefore, the castaways from the air had been thrown upon Lincoln Island.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\nTwo years already! and for two years the colonists had had no\\ncommunication with their fellow-creatures! They were without news from\\nthe civilized world, lost on this island, as completely as if they had\\nbeen on the most minute star of the celestial hemisphere!\\n\\nWhat was now happening in their country? The picture of their native\\nland was always before their eyes, the land torn by civil war at the\\ntime they left it, and which the Southern rebellion was perhaps still\\nstaining with blood! It was a great sorrow to them, and they often\\ntalked together of these things, without ever doubting however that\\nthe cause of the North must triumph, for the honor of the American\\nConfederation.\\n\\nDuring these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the island;\\nor, at least, not a sail had been seen. It was evident that Lincoln\\nIsland was out of the usual track, and also that it was unknown,--as was\\nbesides proved by the maps,--for though there was no port, vessels might\\nhave visited it for the purpose of renewing their store of water. But\\nthe surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could reach, and\\nthe colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land.\\n\\nHowever, one chance of rescue existed, and this chance was discussed\\none day on the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered\\ntogether in the dining-room of Granite House.\\n\\nThey had been talking of America, of their native country, which they\\nhad so little hope of ever seeing again.\\n\\n“Decidedly we have only one way,” said Spilett, “one single way for\\nleaving Lincoln Island, and that is, to build a vessel large enough to\\nsail several hundred miles. It appears to me, that when one has built a\\nboat it is just as easy to build a ship!”\\n\\n“And in which we might go to the Pomoutous,” added Herbert, “just as\\neasily as we went to Tabor Island.”\\n\\n“I do not say no,” replied Pencroft, who had always the casting vote\\nin maritime questions; “I do not say no, although it is not exactly the\\nsame thing to make a long as a short voyage! If our little craft had\\nbeen caught in any heavy gale of wind during the voyage to Tabor Island,\\nwe should have known that land was at no great distance either way; but\\ntwelve hundred miles is a pretty long way, and the nearest land is at\\nleast that distance!”\\n\\n“Would you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?” asked\\nthe reporter.\\n\\n“I will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett,” answered the\\nsailor, “and you know well that I am not a man to flinch!”\\n\\n“Remember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us now,”\\n remarked Neb.\\n\\n“Who is that?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Ayrton.”\\n\\n“If he will consent to come,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“Nonsense!” returned the reporter; “do you think that if Lord\\nGlenarvan’s yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still\\nliving there, Ayrton would have refused to depart?”\\n\\n“You forget, my friends,” then said Cyrus Harding, “that Ayrton was not\\nin possession of his reason during the last years of his stay there. But\\nthat is not the question. The point is to know if we may count among\\nour chances of being rescued, the return of the Scotch vessel. Now,\\nLord Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would return to take him off from\\nTabor Island when he considered that his crimes were expiated, and I\\nbelieve that he will return.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the reporter, “and I will add that he will return soon, for\\nit is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned.”\\n\\n“Well!” answered Pencroft, “I agree with you that the nobleman will\\nreturn, and soon too. But where will he touch? At Tabor Island, and not\\nat Lincoln Island.”\\n\\n“That is the more certain,” replied Herbert, “as Lincoln Island is not\\neven marked on the map.”\\n\\n“Therefore, my friends,” said the engineer, “we ought to take the\\nnecessary precautions for making our presence and that of Ayrton on\\nLincoln Island known at Tabor Island.”\\n\\n“Certainly,” answered the reporter, “and nothing is easier than to place\\nin the hut, which was Captain Grant’s and Ayrton’s dwelling, a notice\\nwhich Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help finding, giving the\\nposition of our island.”\\n\\n“It is a pity,” remarked the sailor, “that we forgot to take that\\nprecaution on our first visit to Tabor Island.”\\n\\n“And why should we have done it?” asked Herbert. “At that time we did\\nnot know Ayrton’s history; we did not know that any one was likely to\\ncome some day to fetch him, and when we did know his history, the season\\nwas too advanced to allow us to return then to Tabor Island.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Harding, “it was too late, and we must put off the voyage\\nuntil next spring.”\\n\\n“But suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“That is not probable,” replied the engineer, “for Lord Glenarvan would\\nnot choose the winter season to venture into these seas. Either he has\\nalready returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton has been with us, that is\\nto say, during the last five months and has left again; or he will not\\ncome till later, and it will be time enough in the first fine October\\ndays to go to Tabor Island, and leave a notice there.”\\n\\n“We must allow,” said Neb, “that it will be very unfortunate if the\\n‘Duncan’ has returned to these parts only a few months ago!”\\n\\n“I hope that it is not so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and that Heaven has\\nnot deprived us of the best chance which remains to us.”\\n\\n“I think,” observed the reporter, “that at any rate we shall know what\\nwe have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island, for if the yacht\\nhas returned there, they will necessarily have left some traces of their\\nvisit.”\\n\\n“That is evident,” answered the engineer. “So then, my friends, since\\nwe have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait patiently,\\nand if it is taken from us we shall see what will be best to do.”\\n\\n“At any rate,” remarked Pencroft, “it is well understood that if we\\ndo leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were uncomfortable\\nthere!”\\n\\n“No, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “it will be because we are far\\nfrom all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his friends,\\nhis native land!”\\n\\nMatters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large enough to\\nsail either to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New Zealand in\\nthe west, was no longer talked of, and they busied themselves in their\\naccustomed occupations, with a view to wintering a third time in Granite\\nHouse.\\n\\nHowever, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on, their\\nlittle vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the island.\\nA complete survey of the coast had not yet been made, and the colonists\\nhad but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north, from the\\nmouth of Falls River to the Mandible Capes, as well as of the narrow bay\\nbetween them, which opened like a shark’s jaws.\\n\\nThe plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus Harding\\nfully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this part of his\\ndomain.\\n\\nThe weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by sudden\\nmovements, and they could therefore count on tolerable weather. However,\\nduring the first week of April, after a sudden barometrical fall, a\\nrenewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of wind, lasting five or six\\ndays; then the needle of the instrument remained stationary at a\\nheight of twenty-nine inches and nine-tenths, and the weather appeared\\npropitious for an excursion.\\n\\nThe departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the “Bonadventure,”\\n anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a voyage which might be of\\nsome duration.\\n\\nCyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and proposed\\nthat he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to remain on\\nshore, it was decided that he should come to Granite House during the\\nabsence of his companions. Master Jup was ordered to keep him company,\\nand made no remonstrance.\\n\\nOn the morning of the 16th of April all the colonists, including Top,\\nembarked. A fine breeze blew from the south-west, and the “Bonadventure”\\n tacked on leaving Port Balloon so as to reach Reptile End. Of the ninety\\nmiles which the perimeter of the island measured, twenty included the\\nsouth coast between the port and the promontory. The wind being right\\nahead it was necessary to hug the shore.\\n\\nIt took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on leaving\\nport had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for\\nsix hours against the flood. It was nightfall before the promontory was\\ndoubled.\\n\\nThe sailor then proposed to the engineer that they should continue\\nsailing slowly with two reefs in the sail. But Harding preferred to\\nanchor a few cable-lengths from the shore, so as to survey that part of\\nthe coast during the day. It was agreed also that as they were anxious\\nfor a minute exploration of the coast they should not sail during the\\nnight, but would always, when the weather permitted it, be at anchor\\nnear the shore.\\n\\nThe night was passed under the promontory, and the wind having fallen,\\nnothing disturbed the silence. The passengers, with the exception of the\\nsailor, scarcely slept as well on board the “Bonadventure” as they would\\nhave done in their rooms at Granite House, but they did sleep however.\\nPencroft set sail at break of day, and by going on the larboard tack\\nthey could keep close to the shore.\\n\\nThe colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast, since they had already\\nexplored it on foot, and yet it again excited their admiration. They\\ncoasted along as close in as possible, so as to notice everything,\\navoiding always the trunks of trees which floated here and there.\\nSeveral times also they anchored, and Gideon Spilett took photographs of\\nthe superb scenery.\\n\\nAbout noon the “Bonadventure” arrived at the mouth of Falls River.\\nBeyond, on the left bank, a few scattered trees appeared, and three\\nmiles further even these dwindled into solitary groups among the western\\nspurs of the mountain, whose arid ridge sloped down to the shore.\\n\\nWhat a contrast between the northern and southern part of the coast!\\nIn proportion as one was woody and fertile so was the other rugged and\\nbarren! It might have been designated as one of those iron coasts, as\\nthey are called in some countries, and its wild confusion appeared to\\nindicate that a sudden crystallization had been produced in the yet\\nliquid basalt of some distant geological sea. These stupendous masses\\nwould have terrified the settlers if they had been cast at first on\\nthis part of the island! They had not been able to perceive the sinister\\naspect of this shore from the summit of Mount Franklin, for they\\noverlooked it from too great a height, but viewed from the sea it\\npresented a wild appearance which could not perhaps be equaled in any\\ncorner of the globe.\\n\\nThe “Bonadventure” sailed along this coast for the distance of half a\\nmile. It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes,\\nfrom twenty to three hundred feet in height, and of all shapes, round\\nlike towers, prismatic like steeples, pyramidal like obelisks, conical\\nlike factory chimneys. An iceberg of the Polar seas could not have been\\nmore capricious in its terrible sublimity! Here, bridges were thrown\\nfrom one rock to another; there, arches like those of a wave, into the\\ndepths of which the eye could not penetrate; in one place, large vaulted\\nexcavations presented a monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of\\ncolumns, spires, and arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever\\npossessed. Every caprice of nature, still more varied than those of the\\nimagination, appeared on this grand coast, which extended over a length\\nof eight or nine miles.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions gazed, with a feeling of surprise\\nbordering on stupefaction. But, although they remained silent, Top,\\nnot being troubled with feelings of this sort, uttered barks which were\\nrepeated by the thousand echoes of the basaltic cliff. The engineer\\neven observed that these barks had something strange in them, like those\\nwhich the dog had uttered at the mouth of the well in Granite House.\\n\\n“Let us go close in,” said he.\\n\\nAnd the “Bonadventure” sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore.\\nPerhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed\\nthere? But Harding saw nothing, not a cavern, not a cleft which could\\nserve as a retreat to any being whatever, for the foot of the cliff was\\nwashed by the surf. Soon Top’s barks ceased, and the vessel continued\\nher course at a few cables-length from the coast.\\n\\nIn the northwest part of the island the shore became again flat and\\nsandy. A few trees here and there rose above a low, marshy ground, which\\nthe colonists had already surveyed, and in violent contrast to the other\\ndesert shore, life was again manifested by the presence of myriads of\\nwater-fowl. That evening the “Bonadventure” anchored in a small bay\\nto the north of the island, near the land, such was the depth of water\\nthere. The night passed quietly, for the breeze died away with the last\\nlight of day, and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn.\\n\\nAs it was easy to land, the usual hunters of the colony, that is to say,\\nHerbert and Gideon Spilett, went for a ramble of two hours or so, and\\nreturned with several strings of wild duck and snipe. Top had\\ndone wonders, and not a bird had been lost, thanks to his zeal and\\ncleverness.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock in the morning the “Bonadventure” set sail, and ran\\nrapidly towards North Mandible Cape, for the wind was right astern and\\nfreshening rapidly.\\n\\n“However,” observed Pencroft, “I should not be surprised if a gale came\\nup from the west. Yesterday the sun set in a very red-looking horizon,\\nand now, this morning, those mares-tails don’t forbode anything good.”\\n\\nThese mares-tails are cirrus clouds, scattered in the zenith, their\\nheight from the sea being less than five thousand feet. They look like\\nlight pieces of cotton wool, and their presence usually announces some\\nsudden change in the weather.\\n\\n“Well,” said Harding, “let us carry as much sail as possible, and run\\nfor shelter into Shark Gulf. I think that the ‘Bonadventure’ will be\\nsafe there.”\\n\\n“Perfectly,” replied Pencroft, “and besides, the north coast is merely\\nsand, very uninteresting to look at.”\\n\\n“I shall not be sorry,” resumed the engineer, “to pass not only to-night\\nbut to-morrow in that bay, which is worth being carefully explored.”\\n\\n“I think that we shall be obliged to do so, whether we like it or not,”\\n answered Pencroft, “for the sky looks very threatening towards the west.\\nDirty weather is coming on!”\\n\\n“At any rate we have a favorable wind for reaching Cape Mandible,”\\n observed the reporter.\\n\\n“A very fine wind,” replied the sailor; “but we must tack to enter the\\ngulf, and I should like to see my way clear in these unknown quarters.”\\n\\n“Quarters which appear to be filled with rocks,” added Herbert, “if we\\njudge by what we saw on the south coast of Shark Gulf.”\\n\\n“Pencroft,” said Cyrus Harding, “do as you think best, we will leave it\\nto you.”\\n\\n“Don’t make your mind uneasy, captain,” replied the sailor, “I shall not\\nexpose myself needlessly! I would rather a knife were run into my ribs\\nthan a sharp rock into those of my ‘Bonadventure!’”\\n\\nThat which Pencroft called ribs was the part of his vessel under water,\\nand he valued it more than his own skin.\\n\\n“What o’clock is it?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Ten o’clock,” replied Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“And what distance is it to the Cape, captain?”\\n\\n“About fifteen miles,” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“That’s a matter of two hours and a half,” said the sailor, “and we\\nshall be off the Cape between twelve and one o’clock. Unluckily, the\\ntide will be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of the gulf.\\nI am afraid that it will be very difficult to get in, having both wind\\nand tide against us.”\\n\\n“And the more so that it is a full moon to-day,” remarked Herbert, “and\\nthese April tides are very strong.”\\n\\n“Well, Pencroft,” asked Harding, “can you not anchor off the Cape?”\\n\\n“Anchor near land, with bad weather coming on!” exclaimed the sailor.\\n“What are you thinking of, captain? We should run aground, of a\\ncertainty!”\\n\\n“What will you do then?”\\n\\n“I shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to say, till\\nabout seven in the evening, and if there is still light enough I will\\ntry to enter the gulf; if not, we must stand off and on during the\\nnight, and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise.”\\n\\n“As I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you,” answered Harding.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Pencroft, “if there was only a lighthouse on the coast, it\\nwould be much more convenient for sailors.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Herbert, “and this time we shall have no obliging\\nengineer to light a fire to guide us into port!”\\n\\n“Why, indeed, my dear Cyrus,” said Spilett, “we have never thanked you;\\nbut frankly, without that fire we should never have been able--”\\n\\n“A fire?” asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter’s words.\\n\\n“We mean, captain,” answered Pencroft, “that on board the ‘Bonadventure’\\nwe were very anxious during the few hours before our return, and we\\nshould have passed to windward of the island, if it had not been for the\\nprecaution you took of lighting a fire the night of the 19th of October,\\non Prospect Heights.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes! That was a lucky idea of mine!” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“And this time,” continued the sailor, “unless the idea occurs to\\nAyrton, there will be no one to do us that little service!”\\n\\n“No! No one!” answered Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nA few minutes after, finding himself alone in the bows of the vessel,\\nwith the reporter, the engineer bent down and whispered,--\\n\\n“If there is one thing certain in this world, Spilett, it is that I\\nnever lighted any fire during the night of the 19th of October, neither\\non Prospect Heights nor on any other part of the island!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\nThings happened as Pencroft had predicted, he being seldom mistaken in\\nhis prognostications. The wind rose, and from a fresh breeze it soon\\nincreased to a regular gale; that is to say, it acquired a speed of from\\nforty to forty-five miles an hour, before which a ship in the open sea\\nwould have run under close-reefed topsails. Now, as it was nearly six\\no’clock when the “Bonadventure” reached the gulf, and as at that\\nmoment the tide turned, it was impossible to enter. They were therefore\\ncompelled to stand off, for even if he had wished to do so, Pencroft\\ncould not have gained the mouth of the Mercy. Hoisting the jib to the\\nmainmast by way of a storm-sail, he hove to, putting the head of the\\nvessel towards the land.\\n\\nFortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being sheltered by\\nthe land, did not run very high. They had then little to fear from\\nthe waves, which always endanger small craft. The “Bonadventure” would\\ndoubtlessly not have capsized, for she was well ballasted, but enormous\\nmasses of water falling on the deck might injure her if her timbers\\ncould not sustain them. Pencroft, as a good sailor, was prepared\\nfor anything. Certainly, he had great confidence in his vessel, but\\nnevertheless he awaited the return of day with some anxiety.\\n\\nDuring the night, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett had no opportunity\\nfor talking together, and yet the words pronounced in the reporter’s\\near by the engineer were well worth being discussed, together with the\\nmysterious influence which appeared to reign over Lincoln Island. Gideon\\nSpilett did not cease from pondering over this new and inexplicable\\nincident, the appearance of a fire on the coast of the island. The fire\\nhad actually been seen! His companions, Herbert and Pencroft, had seen\\nit with him! The fire had served to signalize the position of the island\\nduring that dark night, and they had not doubted that it was lighted by\\nthe engineer’s hand; and here was Cyrus Harding expressly declaring that\\nhe had never done anything of the sort! Spilett resolved to recur to\\nthis incident as soon as the “Bonadventure” returned, and to urge Cyrus\\nHarding to acquaint their companions with these strange facts. Perhaps\\nit would be decided to make in common a complete investigation of every\\npart of Lincoln Island.\\n\\nHowever that might be, on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet\\nunknown shores, which formed the entrance to the gulf, and the little\\nvessel stood off during the night.\\n\\nWhen the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon, the\\nwind, which had slightly fallen, shifted two points, and enabled\\nPencroft to enter the narrow gulf with greater ease. Towards seven\\no’clock in the morning, the “Bonadventure,” weathering the North\\nMandible Cape, entered the strait and glided on to the waters, so\\nstrangely enclosed in the frame of lava.\\n\\n“Well,” said Pencroft, “this bay would make admirable roads, in which a\\nwhole fleet could lie at their ease!”\\n\\n“What is especially curious,” observed Harding, “is that the gulf\\nhas been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the volcano, and\\naccumulated by successive eruptions. The result is that the gulf is\\ncompletely sheltered on all sides, and I believe that even in the\\nstormiest weather, the sea here must be as calm as a lake.”\\n\\n“No doubt,” returned the sailor, “since the wind has only that narrow\\nentrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides, the north\\ncape protects that of the south in a way which would make the entrance\\nof gusts very difficult. I declare our ‘Bonadventure’ could stay here\\nfrom one end of the year to the other, without even dragging at her\\nanchor!”\\n\\n“It is rather large for her!” observed the reporter.\\n\\n“Well! Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “I agree that it is too large\\nfor the ‘Bonadventure,’ but if the fleets of the Union were in want of a\\nharbor in the Pacific, I don’t think they would ever find a better place\\nthan this!”\\n\\n“We are in the shark’s mouth,” remarked Neb, alluding to the form of the\\ngulf.\\n\\n“Right into its mouth, my honest Neb!” replied Herbert, “but you are not\\nafraid that it will shut upon us, are you?”\\n\\n“No, Mr. Herbert,” answered Neb, “and yet this gulf here doesn’t please\\nme much! It has a wicked look!”\\n\\n“Hallo!” cried Pencroft, “here is Neb turning up his nose at my gulf,\\njust as I was thinking of presenting it to America!”\\n\\n“But, at any rate, is the water deep enough?” asked the engineer, “for a\\ndepth sufficient for the keel of the ‘Bonadventure’ would not be enough\\nfor those of our iron-clads.”\\n\\n“That is easily found out,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\nAnd the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a\\nlead-line, and to which was fastened a lump of iron. This cord measured\\nnearly fifty fathoms, and its entire length was unrolled without finding\\nany bottom.\\n\\n“There,” exclaimed Pencroft, “our iron-clads can come here after all!\\nThey would not run aground!”\\n\\n“Indeed,” said Gideon Spilett, “this gulf is a regular abyss, but,\\ntaking into consideration the volcanic origin of the island, it is not\\nastonishing that the sea should offer similar depressions.”\\n\\n“One would say too,” observed Herbert, “that these cliffs were perfectly\\nperpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even with a line five\\nor six times longer, Pencroft would not find bottom.”\\n\\n“That is all very well,” then said the reporter, “but I must point out\\nto Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very important respect!”\\n\\n“And what is that, Mr. Spilett?”\\n\\n“An opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the interior of\\nthe island. I do not see a spot on which we could land.” And, in\\nfact, the steep lava cliffs did not afford a single place suitable for\\nlanding. They formed an insuperable barrier, recalling, but with more\\nwildness, the fiords of Norway. The “Bonadventure,” coasting as close\\nas possible along the cliffs, did not discover even a projection which\\nwould allow the passengers to leave the deck.\\n\\nPencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they\\ncould soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and then, as\\nthere was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf, he steered his\\nvessel towards the strait and passed out at about two o’clock in the\\nafternoon.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Neb, uttering a sigh of satisfaction.\\n\\nOne might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his ease in\\nthose enormous jaws.\\n\\nThe distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was not more\\nthan eight miles. The head of the “Bonadventure” was put towards Granite\\nHouse, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran rapidly along the\\ncoast.\\n\\nTo the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand dunes,\\namong which the engineer had been so singularly recovered, and which\\nseabirds frequented in thousands.\\n\\nAbout four o’clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on his\\nleft, entered the channel which separated it from the coast, and at five\\no’clock the anchor of the “Bonadventure” was buried in the sand at the\\nmouth of the Mercy.\\n\\nThe colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling. Ayrton\\nwas waiting for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to meet them,\\ngiving vent to deep grunts of satisfaction.\\n\\nA complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been made,\\nand no suspicious appearances had been observed. If any mysterious being\\nresided on it, it could only be under cover of the impenetrable forest\\nof the Serpentine Peninsula, to which the colonists had not yet directed\\ntheir investigations.\\n\\nGideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it was\\nagreed that they should direct the attention of their companions to the\\nstrange character of certain incidents which had occurred on the island,\\nand of which the last was the most unaccountable.\\n\\nHowever, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been kindled on\\nthe shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from repeating for the\\ntwentieth time to the reporter,--\\n\\n“But are you quite sure of having seen it? Was it not a partial eruption\\nof the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?”\\n\\n“No, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “it was certainly a fire lighted by\\nthe hand of man. Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert. They saw it as\\nI saw it myself, and they will confirm my words.”\\n\\nIn consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of April, in\\nthe evening, when the settlers were all collected on Prospect Heights,\\nCyrus Harding began by saying,--\\n\\n“My friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to certain\\nincidents which have occurred in the island, on the subject of which I\\nshall be happy to have your advice. These incidents are, so to speak,\\nsupernatural--”\\n\\n“Supernatural!” exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke from\\nhis mouth. “Can it be possible that our island is supernatural?”\\n\\n“No, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly,” replied the engineer;\\n“unless you can explain that which Spilett and I have until now failed\\nto understand.”\\n\\n“Speak away, captain,” answered the sailor.\\n\\n“Well, have you understood,” then said the engineer, “how was it that\\nafter falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile into the\\ninterior of the island, and that, without my having any consciousness of\\nmy removal there?”\\n\\n“Unless, being unconscious--” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“That is not admissible,” replied the engineer. “But to continue. Have\\nyou understood how Top was able to discover your retreat five miles from\\nthe cave in which I was lying?”\\n\\n“The dog’s instinct--” observed Herbert.\\n\\n“Singular instinct!” returned the reporter, “since notwithstanding the\\nstorm of rain and wind which was raging during that night, Top arrived\\nat the Chimneys, dry and without a speck of mud!”\\n\\n“Let us continue,” resumed the engineer. “Have you understood how our\\ndog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his\\nstruggle with the dugong?”\\n\\n“No! I confess, not at all,” replied Pencroft, “and the wound which the\\ndugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been made with a\\nsharp instrument; that can’t be understood, either.”\\n\\n“Let us continue again,” said Harding. “Have you understood, my friends,\\nhow that bullet got into the body of the young peccary; how that case\\nhappened to be so fortunately stranded, without there being any trace\\nof a wreck; how that bottle containing the document presented itself\\nso opportunely, during our first sea-excursion; how our canoe, having\\nbroken its moorings, floated down the current of the Mercy and rejoined\\nus at the very moment we needed it; how after the ape invasion the\\nladder was so obligingly thrown down from Granite House; and lastly, how\\nthe document, which Ayrton asserts was never written by him, fell into\\nour hands?”\\n\\nAs Cyrus Harding thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the singular\\nincidents which had occurred in the island, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft\\nstared at each other, not knowing what to reply, for this succession of\\nincidents, grouped thus for the first time, could not but excite their\\nsurprise to the highest degree.\\n\\n“‘Pon my word,” said Pencroft at last, “you are right, captain, and it\\nis difficult to explain all these things!”\\n\\n“Well, my friends,” resumed the engineer, “a last fact has just been\\nadded to these, and it is no less incomprehensible than the others!”\\n\\n“What is it, captain?” asked Herbert quickly.\\n\\n“When you were returning from Tabor Island, Pencroft,” continued the\\nengineer, “you said that a fire appeared on Lincoln Island?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” answered the sailor.\\n\\n“And you are quite certain of having seen this fire?”\\n\\n“As sure as I see you now.”\\n\\n“You also, Herbert?”\\n\\n“Why, captain,” cried Herbert, “that fire was blazing like a star of the\\nfirst magnitude!”\\n\\n“But was it not a star?” urged the engineer.\\n\\n“No,” replied Pencroft, “for the sky was covered with thick clouds, and\\nat any rate a star would not have been so low on the horizon. But Mr.\\nSpilett saw it as well as we, and he will confirm our words.”\\n\\n“I will add,” said the reporter, “that the fire was very bright, and\\nthat it shot up like a sheet of lightning.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes! exactly,” added Herbert, “and it was certainly placed on the\\nheights of Granite House.”\\n\\n“Well, my friends,” replied Cyrus Harding, “during the night of the 19th\\nof October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the coast.”\\n\\n“You did not!” exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his astonishment,\\nnot being able to finish his sentence.\\n\\n“We did not leave Granite House,” answered Cyrus Harding, “and if a fire\\nappeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand than ours!”\\n\\nPencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied. No illusion could be\\npossible, and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the\\n19th of October. Yes! they had to acknowledge it, a mystery existed! An\\ninexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the colonists, but very\\nirritating to their curiosity, was executed always in the nick of time\\non Lincoln Island. Could there be some being hidden in its profoundest\\nrecesses? It was necessary at any cost to ascertain this.\\n\\nHarding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of Top and\\nJup when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which placed Granite\\nHouse in communication with the sea, and he told them that he had\\nexplored the well, without discovering anything suspicious. The final\\nresolve taken, in consequence of this conversation, by all the members\\nof the colony, was that as soon as the fine season returned they would\\nthoroughly search the whole of the island.\\n\\nBut from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious. He felt as if the\\nisland which he had made his own personal property belonged to him\\nentirely no longer, and that he shared it with another master, to\\nwhom, willing or not, he felt subject. Neb and he often talked of those\\nunaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining them to the\\nmarvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln Island was under the\\ndominion of some supernatural power.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May, the\\nNovember of the northern zones. It appeared that the winter would\\nbe severe and forward. The preparations for the winter season were\\ntherefore commenced without delay.\\n\\nNevertheless, the colonists were well prepared to meet the winter,\\nhowever hard it might be. They had plenty of felt clothing, and the\\nmusmons, very numerous by this time, had furnished an abundance of wool\\nnecessary for the manufacture of this warm material.\\n\\nIt is unnecessary to say that Ayrton had been provided with this\\ncomfortable clothing. Cyrus Harding proposed that he should come to\\nspend the bad season with them in Granite House, where he would be\\nbetter lodged than at the corral, and Ayrton promised to do so, as soon\\nas the last work at the corral was finished. He did this towards the\\nmiddle of April. From that time Ayrton shared the common life, and made\\nhimself useful on all occasions; but still humble and sad, he never took\\npart in the pleasures of his companions.\\n\\nFor the greater part of this, the third winter which the settlers passed\\nin Lincoln Island, they were confined to Granite House. There were many\\nviolent storms and frightful tempests, which appeared to shake the rocks\\nto their very foundations. Immense waves threatened to overwhelm the\\nisland, and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have\\nbeen dashed to pieces. Twice, during one of these hurricanes, the Mercy\\nswelled to such a degree as to give reason to fear that the bridges\\nwould be swept away, and it was necessary to strengthen those on the\\nshore, which disappeared under the foaming waters, when the sea beat\\nagainst the beach.\\n\\nIt may well be supposed that such storms, comparable to water-spouts in\\nwhich were mingled rain and snow, would cause great havoc on the\\nplateau of Prospect Heights. The mill and the poultry-yard particularly\\nsuffered. The colonists were often obliged to make immediate repairs,\\nwithout which the safety of the birds would have been seriously\\nthreatened.\\n\\nDuring the worst weather, several jaguars and troops of quadrumana\\nventured to the edge of the plateau, and it was always to be feared that\\nthe most active and audacious would, urged by hunger, manage to cross\\nthe stream, which besides, when frozen, offered them an easy passage.\\nPlantations and domestic animals would then have been infallibly\\ndestroyed, without a constant watch, and it was often necessary to\\nmake use of the guns to keep those dangerous visitors at a respectful\\ndistance. Occupation was not wanting to the colonists, for without\\nreckoning their out-door cares, they had always a thousand plans for the\\nfitting up of Granite House.\\n\\nThey had also some fine sporting excursions, which were made during the\\nfrost in the vast Tadorn Marsh. Gideon Spilett and Herbert, aided by\\nJup and Top, did not miss a shot in the midst of myriads of wild-duck,\\nsnipe, teal, and others. The access to these hunting-grounds was easy;\\nbesides, whether they reached them by the road to Port Balloon, after\\nhaving passed the Mercy Bridge, or by turning the rocks from Flotsam\\nPoint, the hunters were never distant from Granite House more than two\\nor three miles.\\n\\nThus passed the four winter months, which were really rigorous, that is\\nto say, June, July, August, and September. But, in short, Granite House\\ndid not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather, and it was\\nthe same with the corral, which, less exposed than the plateau, and\\nsheltered partly by Mount Franklin, only received the remains of the\\nhurricanes, already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the\\nshore. The damages there were consequently of small importance, and the\\nactivity and skill of Ayrton promptly repaired them, when some time in\\nOctober he returned to pass a few days in the corral.\\n\\nDuring this winter, no fresh inexplicable incident occurred. Nothing\\nstrange happened, although Pencroft and Neb were on the watch for the\\nmost insignificant facts to which they attached any mysterious cause.\\nTop and Jup themselves no longer growled round the well or gave any\\nsigns of uneasiness. It appeared, therefore, as if the series of\\nsupernatural incidents was interrupted, although they often talked of\\nthem during the evenings in Granite House, and they remained thoroughly\\nresolved that the island should be searched, even in those parts the\\nmost difficult to explore. But an event of the highest importance, and\\nof which the consequences might be terrible, momentarily diverted from\\ntheir projects Cyrus Harding and his companions.\\n\\nIt was the month of October. The fine season was swiftly returning.\\nNature was reviving; and among the evergreen foliage of the coniferae\\nwhich formed the border of the wood, already appeared the young leaves\\nof the banksias, deodars, and other trees.\\n\\nIt may be remembered that Gideon Spilett and Herbert had, at different\\ntimes, taken photographic views of Lincoln Island.\\n\\nNow, on the 17th of this month of October, towards three o’clock in\\nthe afternoon, Herbert, enticed by the charms of the sky, thought of\\nreproducing Union Bay, which was opposite to Prospect Heights, from Cape\\nMandible to Claw Cape.\\n\\nThe horizon was beautifully clear, and the sea, undulating under a soft\\nbreeze, was as calm as the waters of a lake, sparkling here and there\\nunder the sun’s rays.\\n\\nThe apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining-room\\nat Granite House, and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay.\\nHerbert proceeded as he was accustomed to do, and the negative obtained,\\nhe went away to fix it by means of the chemicals deposited in a dark\\nnook of Granite House.\\n\\nReturning to the bright light, and examining it well, Herbert perceived\\non his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon.\\nHe endeavored to make it disappear by reiterated washing, but could not\\naccomplish it.\\n\\n“It is a flaw in the glass,” he thought.\\n\\nAnd then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong\\nmagnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes.\\n\\nBut he had scarcely looked at it, when he uttered a cry, and the glass\\nalmost fell from his hands.\\n\\nImmediately running to the room in which Cyrus Harding then was, he\\nextended the negative and magnifier towards the engineer, pointing out\\nthe little spot.\\n\\nHarding examined it; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the window.\\n\\nThe telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last stopped on\\nthe looked-for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it, pronounced one word\\nonly,--\\n\\n“A vessel!”\\n\\nAnd in fact a vessel was in sight, off Lincoln Island!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART 3\\n\\nTHE SECRET OF THE ISLAND\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nIt was now two years and a half since the castaways from the balloon had\\nbeen thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period there had been no\\ncommunication between them and their fellow-creatures. Once the reporter\\nhad attempted to communicate with the inhabited world by confiding to\\na bird a letter which contained the secret of their situation, but that\\nwas a chance on which it was impossible to reckon seriously. Ayrton,\\nalone, under the circumstances which have been related, had come to\\njoin the little colony. Now, suddenly, on this day, the 17th of October,\\nother men had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island, on that\\ndeserted sea!\\n\\nThere could be no doubt about it! A vessel was there! But would she\\npass on, or would she put into port? In a few hours the colonists would\\ndefinitely know what to expect.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon Spilett,\\nPencroft, and Neb into the dining-room of Granite House, told them\\nwhat had happened. Pencroft, seizing the telescope, rapidly swept the\\nhorizon, and stopping on the indicated point, that is to say, on\\nthat which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic\\nnegative,--\\n\\n“I’m blessed but it is really a vessel!” he exclaimed, in a voice which\\ndid not express any great amount of satisfaction.\\n\\n“Is she coming here?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Impossible to say anything yet,” answered Pencroft, “for her rigging\\nalone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can be seen.”\\n\\n“What is to be done?” asked the lad.\\n\\n“Wait,” replied Harding.\\n\\nAnd for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given up to\\nall the thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the hopes, which\\nwere aroused by this incident--the most important which had occurred\\nsince their arrival in Lincoln Island. Certainly, the colonists were not\\nin the situation of castaways abandoned on a sterile islet, constantly\\ncontending against a cruel nature for their miserable existence, and\\nincessantly tormented by the longing to return to inhabited countries.\\nPencroft and Neb, especially, who felt themselves at once so happy and\\nso rich, would not have left their island without regret. They were\\naccustomed, besides, to this new life in the midst of the domain which\\ntheir intelligence had as it were civilized. But at any rate this ship\\nbrought news from the world, perhaps even from their native land. It was\\nbringing fellow-creatures to them, and it may be conceived how deeply\\ntheir hearts were moved at the sight!\\n\\nFrom time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at the\\nwindow. From thence he very attentively examined the vessel, which was\\nat a distance of twenty miles to the east. The colonists had as yet,\\ntherefore, no means of signalizing their presence. A flag would not have\\nbeen perceived; a gun would not have been heard; a fire would not have\\nbeen visible. However, it was certain that the island, overtopped by\\nMount Franklin, could not escape the notice of the vessel’s lookout. But\\nwhy was the ship coming there? Was it simple chance which brought it to\\nthat part of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor\\nIsland, which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels\\nfrom the Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the\\nAmerican coast? To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply\\nwas suddenly made by Herbert.\\n\\n“Can it be the ‘Duncan’?” he cried.\\n\\nThe “Duncan,” as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan’s yacht, which had\\nleft Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there someday to fetch\\nhim. Now, the islet was not so far distant from Lincoln Island, but\\nthat a vessel, standing for the one, could pass in sight of the other. A\\nhundred and fifty miles only separated them in longitude, and seventy in\\nlatitude.\\n\\n“We must tell Ayrton,” said Gideon Spilett, “and send for him\\nimmediately. He alone can say if it is the ‘Duncan.’”\\n\\nThis was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic\\napparatus which placed the corral in communication with Granite House,\\nsent this telegram:--“Come with all possible speed.”\\n\\nIn a few minutes the bell sounded.\\n\\n“I am coming,” replied Ayrton.\\n\\nThen the settlers continued to watch the vessel.\\n\\n“If it is the ‘Duncan,’” said Herbert, “Ayrton will recognize her\\nwithout difficulty, since he sailed on board her for some time.”\\n\\n“And if he recognizes her,” added Pencroft, “it will agitate him\\nexceedingly!”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Cyrus Harding; “but now Ayrton is worthy to return on\\nboard the ‘Duncan,’ and pray Heaven that it is indeed Lord Glenarvan’s\\nyacht, for I should be suspicious of any other vessel. These are\\nill-famed seas, and I have always feared a visit from Malay pirates to\\nour island.”\\n\\n“We could defend it,’, cried Herbert.\\n\\n“No doubt, my boy,” answered the engineer smiling, “but it would be\\nbetter not to have to defend it.”\\n\\n“A useless observation,” said Spilett. “Lincoln Island is unknown to\\nnavigators, since it is not marked even on the most recent maps. Do\\nyou think, Cyrus, that that is a sufficient motive for a ship, finding\\nherself unexpectedly in sight of new land, to try and visit rather than\\navoid it?”\\n\\n“Certainly,” replied Pencroft.\\n\\n“I think so too,” added the engineer. “It may even be said that it is\\nthe duty of a captain to come and survey any land or island not yet\\nknown, and Lincoln Island is in this position.”\\n\\n“Well,” said Pencroft, “suppose this vessel comes and anchors there a\\nfew cables-lengths from our island, what shall we do?”\\n\\nThis sudden question remained at first without any reply. But Cyrus\\nHarding, after some moments’ thought, replied in the calm tone which was\\nusual to him,--\\n\\n“What we shall do, my friends? What we ought to do is this:--we will\\ncommunicate with the ship, we will take our passage on board her, and we\\nwill leave our island, after having taken possession of it in the name\\nof the United States. Then we will return with any who may wish to\\nfollow us to colonize it definitely, and endow the American Republic\\nwith a useful station in this part of the Pacific Ocean!”\\n\\n“Hurrah!” exclaimed Pencroft, “and that will be no small present\\nwhich we shall make to our country! The colonization is already almost\\nfinished; names are given to every part of the island; there is\\na natural port, fresh water, roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and\\nmanufactories; and there will be nothing to be done but to inscribe\\nLincoln Island on the maps!”\\n\\n“But if anyone seizes it in our absence?” observed Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Hang it!” cried the sailor. “I would rather remain all alone to guard\\nit: and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn’t steal it from him, like a\\nwatch from the pocket of a swell!”\\n\\nFor an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the\\nvessel was or was not standing towards Lincoln Island. She was\\nnearer, but in what direction was she sailing? This Pencroft could not\\ndetermine. However, as the wind was blowing from the northeast, in all\\nprobability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack. Besides, the\\nwind was favorable for bringing her towards the island, and, the sea\\nbeing calm, she would not be afraid to approach although the shallows\\nwere not marked on the chart.\\n\\nTowards four o’clock--an hour after he had been sent for--Ayrton arrived\\nat Granite House. He entered the dining-room saying,--\\n\\n“At your service, gentlemen.”\\n\\nCyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and, leading\\nhim to the window,--\\n\\n“Ayrton,” said he, “we have begged you to come here for an important\\nreason. A ship is in sight of the island.”\\n\\nAyrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became dim;\\nthen, leaning out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but could see\\nnothing.\\n\\n“Take this telescope,” said Spilett, “and look carefully, Ayrton, for\\nit is possible that this ship may be the ‘Duncan’ come to these seas for\\nthe purpose of taking you home again.”\\n\\n“The ‘Duncan!’” murmured Ayrton. “Already?” This last word escaped\\nAyrton’s lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped upon his hands.\\n\\nDid not twelve years’ solitude on a desert island appear to him a\\nsufficient expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned,\\neither in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?\\n\\n“No,” said he, “no! it cannot be the ‘Duncan’!”\\n\\n“Look, Ayrton,” then said the engineer, “for it is necessary that we\\nshould know beforehand what to expect.”\\n\\nAyrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated. During\\nsome minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without uttering a\\nword. Then,--\\n\\n“It is indeed a vessel,” said he, “but I do not think she is the\\n‘Duncan.’”\\n\\n“Why do you not think so?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Because the ‘Duncan’ is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive any trace\\nof smoke either above or near that vessel.”\\n\\n“Perhaps she is simply sailing,” observed Pencroft. “The wind is\\nfavorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she may\\nbe anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land.”\\n\\n“It is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft,” answered Ayrton,\\n“and that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must wait until she\\nis nearer, and then we shall soon know what to expect.”\\n\\nSo saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained silent.\\nThe colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton took no\\npart in the conversation. All were in such a mood that they found it\\nimpossible to continue their work. Gideon Spilett and Pencroft were\\nparticularly nervous, going, coming, not able to remain still in one\\nplace. Herbert felt more curiosity. Neb alone maintained his usual\\ncalm manner. Was not his country that where his master was? As to the\\nengineer, he remained plunged in deep thought, and in his heart feared\\nrather than desired the arrival of the ship. In the meanwhile, the\\nvessel was a little nearer the island. With the aid of the glass, it was\\nascertained that she was a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, which\\nare generally used by the pirates of the Pacific. It was, therefore,\\nreasonable to believe that the engineer’s apprehensions would not be\\njustified, and that the presence of this vessel in the vicinity of the\\nisland was fraught with no danger.\\n\\nPencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to affirm that\\nthe vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was standing obliquely\\ntowards the coast, on the starboard tack, under her topsails and\\ntop-gallant-sails. This was confirmed by Ayrton. But by continuing in\\nthis direction she must soon disappear behind Claw Cape, as the wind\\nwas from the southwest, and to watch her it would be then necessary\\nto ascend the height of Washington Bay, near Port Balloon--a provoking\\ncircumstance, for it was already five o’clock in the evening, and the\\ntwilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult.\\n\\n“What shall we do when night comes on?” asked Gideon Spilett. “Shall we\\nlight a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?”\\n\\nThis was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer still\\nretained some of his presentiments, it was answered in the affirmative.\\nDuring the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever, and, this\\nship gone, would another ever return to the waters of Lincoln Island?\\nWho could foresee what the future would then have in store for the\\ncolonists?\\n\\n“Yes,” said the reporter, “we ought to make known to that vessel,\\nwhoever she may be, that the island is inhabited. To neglect the\\nopportunity which is offered to us might be to create everlasting\\nregrets.”\\n\\nIt was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port\\nBalloon, and that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense\\nfire, the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of the\\nbrig.\\n\\nBut at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to leave\\nGranite House, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and stood\\ndirectly for Union Bay. The brig was a good sailer, for she approached\\nrapidly. Neb and Pencroft put off their departure, therefore, and the\\nglass was put into Ayrton’s hands, that he might ascertain for certain\\nwhether the ship was or was not the “Duncan.” The Scotch yacht was also\\nrigged as a brig. The question was, whether a chimney could be discerned\\nbetween the two masts of the vessel, which was now at a distance of only\\nfive miles.\\n\\nThe horizon was still very clear. The examination was easy, and Ayrton\\nsoon let the glass fall again, saying--\\n\\n“It is not the ‘Duncan’! It could not be!”\\n\\nPencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and\\ncould see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden,\\nwonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably built, and must be a very\\nrapid sailer. But to what nation did she belong? That was difficult to\\nsay.\\n\\n“And yet,” added the sailor, “a flag is floating from her peak, but I\\ncannot distinguish the colors of it.”\\n\\n“In half an hour we shall be certain about that,” answered the reporter.\\n“Besides, it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this\\nship is to land, and, consequently, if not today, to-morrow at the\\nlatest, we shall make his acquaintance.”\\n\\n“Never mind!” said Pencroft. “It is best to know whom we have to deal\\nwith, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow’s colors!”\\n\\nAnd, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass. The day began\\nto fade, and with the day the breeze fell also. The brig’s ensign hung\\nin folds, and it became more and more difficult to observe it.\\n\\n“It is not the American flag,” said Pencroft from time to time, “nor the\\nEnglish, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the French or German\\ncolors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow of Spain. One would\\nsay it was all one color. Let’s see: in these seas, what do we generally\\nmeet with? The Chilean flag?--but that is tri-color. Brazilian?--it is\\ngreen. Japanese?--it is yellow and black, while this--”\\n\\nAt that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag. Ayrton seizing the\\ntelescope which the sailor had put down, put it to his eye, and in a\\nhoarse voice,--\\n\\n“The black flag!” he exclaimed.\\n\\nAnd indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the brig,\\nand they had now good reason for considering her to be a suspicious\\nvessel!\\n\\nHad the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments? Was this a\\npirate vessel? Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the Malay proas\\nwhich still infest it? For what had she come to look at the shores of\\nLincoln Island? Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become\\na magazine for stolen cargoes? Had she come to find on the coast a\\nsheltered port for the winter months? Was the settlers’ honest domain\\ndestined to be transformed into an infamous refuge--the headquarters of\\nthe piracy of the Pacific?\\n\\nAll these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the colonists’\\nimaginations. There was no doubt, besides, of the signification which\\nmust be attached to the color of the hoisted flag. It was that of\\npirates! It was that which the “Duncan” would have carried, had the\\nconvicts succeeded in their criminal design! No time was lost before\\ndiscussing it.\\n\\n“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, “perhaps this vessel only wishes to\\nsurvey the coast of the island. Perhaps her crew will not land. There is\\na chance of it. However that may be, we ought to do everything we can to\\nhide our presence here. The windmill on Prospect Heights is too easily\\nseen. Let Ayrton and Neb go and take down the sails. We must also\\nconceal the windows of Granite House with thick branches. All the fires\\nmust be extinguished, so that nothing may betray the presence of men on\\nthe island.”\\n\\n“And our vessel?” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Oh,” answered Pencroft, “she is sheltered in Port Balloon, and I defy\\nany of those rascals there to find her!”\\n\\nThe engineer’s orders were immediately executed. Neb and Ayrton\\nascended the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal\\nany indication of a settlement. While they were thus occupied, their\\ncompanions went to the border of Jacamar Wood, and brought back a large\\nquantity of branches and creepers, which would at some distance appear\\nas natural foliage, and thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff.\\nAt the same time, the ammunition and guns were placed ready so as to be\\nat hand in case of an unexpected attack.\\n\\nWhen all these precautions had been taken,--\\n\\n“My friends,” said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion, “if the\\nwretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend it--shall we\\nnot?”\\n\\n“Yes, Cyrus,” replied the reporter, “and if necessary we will die to\\ndefend it!”\\n\\nThe engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it warmly.\\nAyrton remained in his corner, not joining the colonists. Perhaps he,\\nthe former convict, still felt himself unworthy to do so!\\n\\nCyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton’s mind, and going to\\nhim--\\n\\n“And you, Ayrton,” he asked, “what will you do?”\\n\\n“My duty,” answered Ayrton.\\n\\nHe then took up his station near the window and gazed through the\\nfoliage.\\n\\nIt was now half-past seven. The sun had disappeared twenty minutes ago\\nbehind Granite House. Consequently the Eastern horizon was becoming\\nobscured. In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards Union\\nBay. She was now not more than two miles off, and exactly opposite the\\nplateau of Prospect Heights, for after having tacked off Claw Cape, she\\nhad drifted towards the north in the current of the rising tide. One\\nmight have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast\\nbay, for a straight line drawn from Claw Cape to Cape Mandible would\\nhave rested on her starboard quarter.\\n\\nWas the brig about to penetrate far into the bay? That was the first\\nquestion. When once in the bay, would she anchor there? That was the\\nsecond. Would she not content herself with only surveying the coast, and\\nstand out to sea again without landing her crew? They would know this in\\nan hour. The colonists could do nothing but wait.\\n\\nCyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black flag\\nwithout deep anxiety. Was it not a direct menace against the work which\\nhe and his companions had till now conducted so successfully? Had these\\npirates--for the sailors of the brig could be nothing else--already\\nvisited the island, since on approaching it they had hoisted their\\ncolors. Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable\\npeculiarities might be explained in this way? Did there exist in the as\\nyet unexplored parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication\\nwith them?\\n\\nTo all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding knew not\\nwhat to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony could not but\\nbe seriously threatened by the arrival of the brig.\\n\\nHowever, he and his companions were determined to fight to the last\\ngasp. It would have been very important to know if the pirates\\nwere numerous and better armed than the colonists. But how was this\\ninformation to be obtained?\\n\\nNight fell. The new moon had disappeared. Profound darkness enveloped\\nthe island and the sea. No light could pierce through the heavy piles\\nof clouds on the horizon. The wind had died away completely with the\\ntwilight. Not a leaf rustled on the trees, not a ripple murmured on\\nthe shore. Nothing could be seen of the ship, all her lights being\\nextinguished, and if she was still in sight of the island, her\\nwhereabouts could not be discovered.\\n\\n“Well! who knows?” said Pencroft. “Perhaps that cursed craft will stand\\noff during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak.”\\n\\nAs if in reply to the sailor’s observation, a bright light flashed in\\nthe darkness, and a cannon-shot was heard.\\n\\nThe vessel was still there and had guns on board.\\n\\nSix seconds elapsed between the flash and the report.\\n\\nTherefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast.\\n\\nAt the same time, the chains were heard rattling through the\\nhawse-holes.\\n\\nThe vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\nThere was no longer any doubt as to the pirates’ intentions. They had\\ndropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it was evident\\nthat the next day by means of their boats they purposed to land on the\\nbeach!\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but, determined\\nthough they were, they must not forget to be prudent. Perhaps their\\npresence might still be concealed in the event of the pirates contenting\\nthemselves with landing on the shore without examining the interior of\\nthe island. It might be, indeed, that their only intention was to obtain\\nfresh water from the Mercy, and it was not impossible that the bridge,\\nthrown across a mile and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory at\\nthe Chimneys might escape their notice.\\n\\nBut why was that flag hoisted at the brig’s peak? What was that shot\\nfired for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of\\ntaking possession. Harding knew now that the vessel was well armed. And\\nwhat had the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the pirates’ guns?\\nA few muskets only.\\n\\n“However,” observed Cyrus Harding, “here we are in an impregnable\\nposition. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the outlet, now that it\\nis hidden under reeds and grass, and consequently it would be impossible\\nfor them to penetrate into Granite House.”\\n\\n“But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all, everything!”\\n exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. “They may spoil everything,\\ndestroy everything in a few hours!”\\n\\n“Everything, Pencroft,” answered Harding, “and we have no means of\\npreventing them.”\\n\\n“Are they numerous? that is the question,” said the reporter. “If they\\nare not more than a dozen, we shall be able to stop them, but forty,\\nfifty, more perhaps!”\\n\\n“Captain Harding,” then said Ayrton, advancing towards the engineer,\\n“will you give me leave?”\\n\\n“For what, my friend?”\\n\\n“To go to that vessel to find out the strength of her crew.”\\n\\n“But Ayrton--” answered the engineer, hesitating, “you will risk your\\nlife--”\\n\\n“Why not, sir?”\\n\\n“That is more than your duty.”\\n\\n“I have more than my duty to do,” replied Ayrton.\\n\\n“Will you go to the ship in the boat?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“No, sir, but I will swim. A boat would be seen where a man may glide\\nbetween wind and water.”\\n\\n“Do you know that the brig is a mile and a quarter from the shore?” said\\nHerbert.\\n\\n“I am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert.”\\n\\n“I tell you it is risking your life,” said the engineer.\\n\\n“That is no matter,” answered Ayrton. “Captain Harding, I ask this as a\\nfavor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes!”\\n\\n“Go, Ayrton,” replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal would\\nhave deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest man.\\n\\n“I will accompany you,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“You mistrust me!” said Ayrton quickly.\\n\\nThen more humbly,--\\n\\n“Alas!”\\n\\n“No! no!” exclaimed Harding with animation, “no, Ayrton, Pencroft does\\nnot mistrust you. You interpret his words wrongly.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” returned the sailor, “I only propose to accompany Ayrton as\\nfar as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely possible, that one\\nof these villains has landed, and in that case two men will not be too\\nmany to hinder him from giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the\\nislet, and he shall go alone to the vessel, since he has proposed to do\\nso.” These things agreed to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure.\\nHis plan was bold, but it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the\\nnight. Once arrived at the vessel’s side, Ayrton, holding on to the main\\nchains, might reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions\\nof the pirates.\\n\\nAyrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the\\nbeach. Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as to suffer\\nless from the temperature of the water, which was still cold. He might,\\nindeed, be obliged to remain in it for several hours.\\n\\nPencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat, moored\\na few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and by the time\\nthey returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was thrown over his\\nshoulders, and the settlers all came round him to press his hand.\\n\\nAyrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.\\n\\nIt was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared\\nin the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at the Chimneys.\\n\\nThe channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite\\nshore of the islet. This was not done without precaution, for fear lest\\nthe pirates might be roaming about there. But after a careful survey,\\nit was evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton then, followed by\\nPencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the\\nholes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea,\\nand swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights\\nhad recently appeared, showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft,\\nhe crouched down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his\\ncompanion.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke, glided\\nthrough the sheet of water without producing the slightest ripple. His\\nhead just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of\\nthe brig, from which the lights were reflected in the water. He thought\\nonly of the duty which he had promised to accomplish, and nothing of the\\ndanger which he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea, often\\nfrequented by sharks. The current bore him along and he rapidly receded\\nfrom the shore.\\n\\nHalf an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen or\\nheard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains. He took\\nbreath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of\\nthe cutwater. There were drying several pairs of sailors’ trousers. He\\nput on a pair. Then settling himself firmly, he listened. They were not\\nsleeping on board the brig. On the contrary, they were talking, singing,\\nlaughing. And these were the sentences, accompanied with oaths, which\\nprincipally struck Ayrton:--\\n\\n“Our brig is a famous acquisition.”\\n\\n“She sails well, and merits her name of the ‘Speedy.’”\\n\\n“She would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of heels.”\\n\\n“Hurrah for her captain!”\\n\\n“Hurrah for Bob Harvey!”\\n\\nWhat Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be\\nunderstood when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he recognized one\\nof his old Australian companions, a daring sailor, who had continued his\\ncriminal career. Bob Harvey had seized, on the shores of Norfolk Island\\nthis brig, which was loaded with arms, ammunition, utensils, and tools\\nof all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands. All his gang had\\ngone on board, and pirates after having been convicts, these wretches,\\nmore ferocious than the Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific,\\ndestroying vessels, and massacring their crews.\\n\\nThe convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply\\nat the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered. The actual crew\\nof the “Speedy” was composed solely of English prisoners, escaped from\\nNorfolk Island.\\n\\nHere it may be well to explain what this island was. In 29deg 2’ south\\nlatitude, and 165deg 42’ east longitude, to the east of Australia, is\\nfound a little island, six miles in circumference, overlooked by Mount\\nPitt, which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea.\\nThis is Norfolk Island, once the seat of an establishment in which were\\nlodged the most intractable convicts from the English penitentiaries.\\nThey numbered 500, under an iron discipline, threatened with terrible\\npunishments, and were guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150 employed\\nunder the orders of the governor. It would be difficult to imagine\\na collection of greater ruffians. Sometimes,--although very\\nrarely,--notwithstanding the extreme surveillance of which they were\\nthe object, many managed to escape, and seizing vessels which they\\nsurprised, they infested the Polynesian Archipelagoes.\\n\\nThus had Bob Harvey and his companions done. Thus had Ayrton formerly\\nwished to do. Bob Harvey had seized the brig “Speedy,” anchored in sight\\nof Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred; and for a year this ship\\nhad scoured the Pacific, under the command of Harvey, now a pirate, and\\nwell known to Ayrton!\\n\\nThe convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop; but a\\nfew, stretched on the deck, were talking loudly.\\n\\nThe conversation still continued amid shouts and libations. Ayrton\\nlearned that chance alone had brought the “Speedy” in sight of Lincoln\\nIsland; Bob Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as Cyrus Harding\\nhad conjectured, finding this unknown land in his course, its position\\nbeing marked on no chart, he had formed the project of visiting it, and,\\nif he found it suitable, of making it the brig’s headquarters.\\n\\nAs to the black flag hoisted at the “Speedy’s” peak, and the gun which\\nhad been fired, in imitation of men-of-war when they lower their\\ncolors, it was pure piratical bravado. It was in no way a signal, and no\\ncommunication yet existed between the convicts and Lincoln Island.\\n\\nThe settlers’ domain was now menaced with terrible danger. Evidently\\nthe island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so\\nincreased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by\\nGranite House, could not but be convenient for the convicts; in their\\nhands it would become an excellent place of refuge, and, being unknown,\\nit would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity and security.\\nEvidently, also, the lives of the settlers would not be respected, and\\nBob Harvey and his accomplices’ first care would be to massacre them\\nwithout mercy. Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the\\nchoice of flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts\\nintended to reside there, and since, in the event of the “Speedy”\\n departing on an expedition, it was probable that some of the crew would\\nremain on shore, so as to settle themselves there. Therefore, it\\nwould be necessary to fight, to destroy every one of these scoundrels,\\nunworthy of pity, and against whom any means would be right. So thought\\nAyrton, and he well knew that Cyrus Harding would be of his way of\\nthinking.\\n\\nBut was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible? That would\\ndepend on the equipment of the brig, and the number of men which she\\ncarried.\\n\\nThis Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after his\\narrival the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large number\\nof the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep, Ayrton did not\\nhesitate to venture onto the “Speedy’s” deck, which the extinguished\\nlanterns now left in total darkness. He hoisted himself onto the\\ncutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle. Then, gliding\\namong the convicts stretched here and there, he made the round of the\\nship, and found that the “Speedy” carried four guns, which would throw\\nshot of from eight to ten pounds in weight. He found also, on touching\\nthem that these guns were breech-loaders. They were therefore, of modern\\nmake, easily used, and of terrible effect.\\n\\nAs to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but\\nit was to be supposed that more were sleeping down below. Besides, by\\nlistening to them, Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on\\nboard. That was a large number for the six settlers of Lincoln Island to\\ncontend with! But now, thanks to Ayrton’s devotion, Cyrus Harding would\\nnot be surprised, he would know the strength of his adversaries, and\\nwould make his arrangements accordingly.\\n\\nThere was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and render to his\\ncompanions an account of the mission with which he had charged himself,\\nand he prepared to regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let\\nhimself down into the water. But to this man, whose wish was, as he had\\nsaid, to do more than his duty, there came an heroic thought. This was\\nto sacrifice his own life, but save the island and the colonists. Cyrus\\nHarding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who,\\neither by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving\\nout the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he\\nthought of his preservers--those who had made him again a man, and an\\nhonest mm, those to whom he owed all--murdered without pity, their works\\ndestroyed, their island turned into a pirates’ den! He said to himself\\nthat he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many disasters, since his\\nold companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized his own plans, and a\\nfeeling of horror took possession of him. Then he was seized with an\\nirresistible desire to blow up the brig and with her, all whom she had\\non board. He would perish in the explosion, but he would have done his\\nduty.\\n\\nAyrton did not hesitate. To reach the powder-room, which is always\\nsituated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy. There would be no want\\nof powder in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be\\nenough to destroy it in an instant.\\n\\nAyrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with numerous\\nsleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A lantern was lighted\\nat the foot of the mainmast, round which was hung a gun-rack, furnished\\nwith weapons of all sorts.\\n\\nAyrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that it was\\nloaded and primed. Nothing more was needed to accomplish the work of\\ndestruction. He then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the\\nbrig’s poop at the powder-magazine.\\n\\nIt was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without\\nstumbling over some half-sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths and\\nkicks. Ayrton was, therefore, more than once obliged to halt. But at\\nlast he arrived at the partition dividing the aftercabin, and found the\\ndoor opening into the magazine itself.\\n\\nAyrton, compelled to force it open, set to work. It was a difficult\\noperation to perform without noise, for he had to break a padlock. But\\nunder his vigorous hand, the padlock broke, and the door was open.\\n\\nAt that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton’s shoulder.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” asked a tall man, in a harsh voice, who,\\nstanding in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern in Ayrton’s\\nface.\\n\\nAyrton drew back. In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had recognized\\nhis former accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have known him, as he\\nmust have thought Ayrton long since dead.\\n\\n“What are you doing here?” again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the\\nwaistband.\\n\\nBut Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp and\\nattempted to rush into the magazine. A shot fired into the midst of the\\npowder-casks, and all would be over!\\n\\n“Help, lads!” shouted Bob Harvey.\\n\\nAt his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing on\\nAyrton, endeavored to throw him down. He soon extricated himself from\\ntheir grasp. He fired his revolver, and two of the convicts fell, but\\na blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his\\nshoulder.\\n\\nAyrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project.\\nBob Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder-magazine, and a movement\\non the deck indicated a general awakening of the pirates. Ayrton must\\nreserve himself to fight at the side of Cyrus Harding. There was nothing\\nfor him but flight!\\n\\nBut was flight still possible? It was doubtful, yet Ayrton resolved to\\ndare everything in order to rejoin his companions.\\n\\nFour barrels of the revolver were still undischarged. Two were\\nfired--one, aimed at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate\\nonly slightly, and Ayrton, profiting by the momentary retreat of his\\nadversaries, rushed towards the companion-ladder to gain the deck.\\nPassing before the lantern, he smashed it with a blow from the butt of\\nhis revolver. A profound darkness ensued, which favored his flight. Two\\nor three pirates, awakened by the noise, were descending the ladder at\\nthe same moment.\\n\\nA fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back, not\\nunderstanding what was going on. Ayrton was on deck in two bounds, and\\nthree seconds later, having discharged his last barrel in the face of\\na pirate who was about to seize him by the throat, he leaped over the\\nbulwarks into the sea.\\n\\nAyrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing around him\\nlike hail.\\n\\nWhat were Pencroft’s feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet! What\\nwere those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb, crouched in the\\nChimneys, when they heard the reports on board the brig! They rushed out\\non to the beach, and, their guns shouldered, they stood ready to repel\\nany attack.\\n\\nThey had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the pirates,\\nhad been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit by the night\\nto make a descent on the island!\\n\\nHalf an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had ceased, and\\nyet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the islet invaded?\\nOught they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and Pencroft? But how? The\\ntide being high at that time, rendered the channel impassable. The boat\\nwas not there! We may imagine the horrible anxiety which took possession\\nof Harding and his companions!\\n\\nAt last, towards half-past twelve, a boat, carrying two men, touched the\\nbeach. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and Pencroft,\\nsafe and sound, whom their friends received with open arms.\\n\\nAll immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton recounted all\\nthat had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the brig, which he had\\nattempted to put into execution.\\n\\nAll hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them that\\ntheir situation was serious. The pirates had been alarmed. They knew\\nthat Lincoln Island was inhabited. They would land upon it in numbers\\nand well armed. They would respect nothing. Should the settlers fall\\ninto their hands, they must expect no mercy!\\n\\n“Well, we shall know how to die!” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Let us go in and watch,” answered the engineer.\\n\\n“Have we any chance of escape, captain?” asked the sailor.\\n\\n“Yes, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“Hum! six against fifty!”\\n\\n“Yes! six! without counting--”\\n\\n“Who?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\nCyrus did not reply, but pointed upwards.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\nThe night passed without incident. The colonists were on the qui vive,\\nand did not leave their post at the Chimneys. The pirates, on their\\nside, did not appear to have made any attempt to land. Since the last\\nshots fired at Ayrton not a report, not even a sound, had betrayed the\\npresence of the brig in the neighborhood of the island. It might have\\nbeen fancied that she had weighed anchor, thinking that she had to deal\\nwith her match, and had left the coast.\\n\\nBut it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the settlers could\\nsee a confused mass through the morning mist. It was the “Speedy.”\\n\\n“These, my friends,” said the engineer, “are the arrangements which\\nappear to me best to make before the fog completely clears away. It\\nhides us from the eyes of the pirates, and we can act without attracting\\ntheir attention. The most important thing is, that the convicts\\nshould believe that the inhabitants of the island are numerous, and\\nconsequently capable of resisting them. I therefore propose that we\\ndivide into three parties. The first of which shall be posted at the\\nChimneys, the second at the mouth of the Mercy. As to the third, I think\\nit would be best to place it on the islet, so as to prevent, or at all\\nevents delay, any attempt at landing. We have the use of two rifles and\\nfour muskets. Each of us will be armed, and, as we are amply provided\\nwith powder and shot, we need not spare our fire. We have nothing to\\nfear from the muskets nor even from the guns of the brig. What can they\\ndo against these rocks? And, as we shall not fire from the windows of\\nGranite House, the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage\\nby throwing shell against it. What is to be feared is, the necessity of\\nmeeting hand-to-hand, since the convicts have numbers on their side. We\\nmust therefore try to prevent them from landing, but without discovering\\nourselves. Therefore, do not economize the ammunition. Fire often, but\\nwith a sure aim. We have each eight or ten enemies to kill, and they\\nmust be killed!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although he spoke\\nin the calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing a piece\\nof work and not ordering a battle. His companions approved these\\narrangements without even uttering a word. There was nothing more to be\\ndone but for each to take his place before the fog should be completely\\ndissipated. Neb and Pencroft immediately ascended to Granite House and\\nbrought back a sufficient quantity of ammunition. Gideon Spilett and\\nAyrton, both very good marksmen, were armed with the two rifles,\\nwhich carried nearly a mile. The four other muskets were divided among\\nHarding, Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert.\\n\\nThe posts were arranged in the following manner:--\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys, thus\\ncommanding the shore to the foot of Granite House.\\n\\nGideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of the\\nMercy, from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to prevent any\\none from crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite shore.\\n\\nAs to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and prepared to\\ncross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet.\\nIn this way, shots being fired from four different points at once,\\nthe convicts would be led to believe that the island was both largely\\npeopled and strongly defended.\\n\\nIn the event of a landing being effected without their having been able\\nto prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the point of being\\ncut off by the brig’s boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were to return in their\\nboat to the shore and proceed towards the threatened spot.\\n\\nBefore starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the last time\\nwrung each other’s hands.\\n\\nPencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to suppress his\\nemotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then they separated.\\n\\nIn a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb\\non the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later\\nAyrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty crossed the channel,\\ndisembarked on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its\\neastern shore.\\n\\nNone of them could have been seen, for they themselves could scarcely\\ndistinguish the brig in the fog.\\n\\nIt was half-past six in the morning.\\n\\nSoon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig issued\\nfrom the vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of\\nthe sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly dispelled the mist.\\n\\nThe “Speedy” now appeared in full view, with a spring on her cable, her\\nhead to the north, presenting her larboard side to the island. Just as\\nHarding had calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from\\nthe coast.\\n\\nThe sinister black flag floated from the peak.\\n\\nThe engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns on board\\nwere pointed at the island. They were evidently ready to fire at a\\nmoment’s notice.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the “Speedy” remained silent. About thirty pirates\\ncould be seen moving on the deck. A few more on the poop; two others\\nposted in the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were attentively\\nsurveying the island.\\n\\nCertainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to give an\\naccount of what had happened during the night on board the brig. Had\\nthis half-naked man, who had forced the door of the powder-magazine, and\\nwith whom they had struggled, who had six times discharged his revolver\\nat them, who had killed one and wounded two others, escaped their shot?\\nHad he been able to swim to shore? Whence did he come? What had been his\\nobject? Had his design really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey\\nhad thought? All this must be confused enough to the convicts’ minds.\\nBut what they could no longer doubt was that the unknown island before\\nwhich the “Speedy” had cast anchor was inhabited, and that there was,\\nperhaps, a numerous colony ready to defend it. And yet no one was to be\\nseen, neither on the shore, nor on the heights. The beach appeared to be\\nabsolutely deserted. At any rate, there was no trace of dwellings. Had\\nthe inhabitants fled into the interior? Thus probably the pirate captain\\nreasoned, and doubtless, like a prudent man, he wished to reconnoiter\\nthe locality before he allowed his men to venture there.\\n\\nDuring an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing could be\\nobserved on board the brig. Evidently Bob Harvey was hesitating. Even\\nwith his strongest telescopes he could not have perceived one of the\\nsettlers crouched among the rocks. It was not even probable that his\\nattention had been awakened by the screen of green branches and creepers\\nhiding the windows of Granite House, and showing rather conspicuously on\\nthe bare rock. Indeed, how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed\\nout, at that height, in the solid granite? From Claw Cape to the\\nMandible Capes, in all the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to\\nlead him to suppose that the island was or could be inhabited.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on board\\nthe “Speedy.” A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into her. They\\nwere armed with muskets; one took the yoke-lines, four others the oars,\\nand the two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to fire, reconnoitered\\nthe island. Their object was no doubt to make an examination but not to\\nland, for in the latter case they would have come in larger numbers. The\\npirates from their look-out could have seen that the coast was sheltered\\nby an islet, separated from it by a channel half a mile in width.\\nHowever, it was soon evident to Cyrus Harding, on observing the\\ndirection followed by the boat, that they would not attempt to penetrate\\ninto the channel, but would land on the islet.\\n\\nPencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock, saw them\\ncoming directly towards them, and waited till they were within range.\\n\\nThe boat advanced with extreme caution. The oars only dipped into the\\nwater at long intervals. It could now be seen that one of the convicts\\nheld a lead-line in his hand, and that he wished to fathom the depth of\\nthe channel hollowed out by the current of the Mercy. This showed that\\nit was Bob Harvey’s intention to bring his brig as near as possible\\nto the coast. About thirty pirates, scattered in the rigging, followed\\nevery movement of the boat, and took the bearings of certain landmarks\\nwhich would allow them to approach without danger. The boat was not more\\nthan two cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped. The man at the\\ntiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land.\\n\\nAt that moment two shots were heard. Smoke curled up from among the\\nrocks of the islet. The man at the helm and the man with the lead-line\\nfell backwards into the boat. Ayrton’s and Pencroft’s balls had struck\\nthem both at the same moment.\\n\\nAlmost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke issued\\nfrom the brig’s side, and a ball, striking the summit of the rock which\\nsheltered Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters, but the two\\nmarksmen remained unhurt.\\n\\nHorrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately continued\\nits way. The man who had been at the tiller was replaced by one of his\\ncomrades, and the oars were rapidly plunged into the water. However,\\ninstead of returning on board as might have been expected, the boat\\ncoasted along the islet, so as to round its southern point. The pirates\\npulled vigorously at their oars that they might get out of range of the\\nbullets.\\n\\nThey advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the\\nshore terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a\\nsemicircular line, still protected by the brig’s guns, they proceeded\\ntowards the mouth of the Mercy.\\n\\nTheir evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and cut off\\nthe colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that whatever their\\nnumber might be, being placed between the fire from the boat and the\\nfire from the brig, they would find themselves in a very disadvantageous\\nposition.\\n\\nA quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction.\\nAbsolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on the water.\\n\\nPencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of being\\ncut off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish to show\\nthemselves as yet to their assailants, and expose themselves to the\\n“Speedy’s” guns, and that they relied on Neb and Gideon Spilett,\\nwatching at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus Harding and Herbert, in\\nambush among the rocks at the Chimneys.\\n\\nTwenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was less than\\ntwo cables-lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was beginning to rise with\\nits accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the\\npirates were drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard\\nrowing that they were able to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as\\nthey were passing within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls\\nsaluted them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of\\nthe boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim.\\n\\nThe brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by the\\nsmoke, but without any other result than that of splintering the rock.\\n\\nThe boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the current,\\nit shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow, passed before\\nHarding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within range, withheld their\\nfire, then, rounding the northern point of the islet with the two\\nremaining oars, they pulled towards the brig.\\n\\nHitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their adversaries\\nhad certainly had the worst of it. The latter already counted four men\\nseriously wounded if not dead; they, on the contrary, unwounded, had not\\nmissed a shot. If the pirates continued to attack them in this way, if\\nthey renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat, they could be\\ndestroyed one by one.\\n\\nIt was now seen how advantageous the engineer’s arrangements had\\nbeen. The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and\\nwell-armed adversaries, whom they could not easily get the better of.\\n\\nHalf an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the current,\\ncould get alongside the “Speedy.” Frightful cries were heard when they\\nreturned on board with the wounded, and two or three guns were fired\\nwith no results.\\n\\nBut now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and possibly\\nby the effect of the evening’s potations, threw themselves into the\\nboat. A second boat was also lowered, in which eight men took their\\nplaces, and while the first pulled straight for the islet, to dislodge\\nthe colonists from thence the second maneuvered so as to force the\\nentrance of the Mercy.\\n\\nThe situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft and\\nAyrton, and they saw that they must regain the mainland.\\n\\nHowever, they waited till the first boat was within range, when two\\nwell-directed balls threw its crew into disorder. Then, Pencroft and\\nAyrton, abandoning their posts, under fire from the dozen muskets, ran\\nacross the islet at full speed, jumped into their boat, crossed the\\nchannel at the moment the second boat reached the southern end, and ran\\nto hide themselves in the Chimneys.\\n\\nThey had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the islet\\nwas overrun with pirates in every direction. Almost at the same moment,\\nfresh reports resounded from the Mercy station, to which the second boat\\nwas rapidly approaching. Two, out of the eight men who manned her,\\nwere mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett and Neb, and the boat herself,\\ncarried irresistibly onto the reefs, was stove in at the mouth of the\\nMercy. But the six survivors, holding their muskets above their heads to\\npreserve them from contact with the water, managed to land on the right\\nbank of the river. Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the\\nambush there, they fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range\\nof the balls.\\n\\nThe actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen convicts,\\nof whom some were no doubt wounded, but who had still a boat at their\\ndisposal; on the island were six, but who could not by any possibility\\nreach Granite House, as they could not cross the river, all the bridges\\nbeing raised.\\n\\n“Hallo,” exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys, “hallo,\\ncaptain! What do you think of it, now?”\\n\\n“I think,” answered the engineer, “that the combat will now take a new\\nform, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as\\nto remain in a position so unfavorable for them!”\\n\\n“They won’t cross the channel,” said the sailor. “Ayrton and Mr.\\nSpilett’s rifles are there to prevent them. You know that they carry\\nmore than a mile!”\\n\\n“No doubt,” replied Herbert; “but what can two rifles do against the\\nbrig’s guns?”\\n\\n“Well, the brig isn’t in the channel yet, I fancy!” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“But suppose she does come there?” said Harding.\\n\\n“That’s impossible, for she would risk running aground and being lost!”\\n\\n“It is possible,” said Ayrton. “The convicts might profit by the high\\ntide to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low tide, it\\nis true; but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts would be no\\nlonger tenable.”\\n\\n“Confound them!” exclaimed Pencroft, “it really seems as if the\\nblackguards were preparing to weigh anchor.”\\n\\n“Perhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!” observed\\nHerbert.\\n\\n“We must wait!” answered Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“But Mr. Spilett and Neb?” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“They will know when it is best to rejoin us. Be ready, Ayrton. It is\\nyours and Spilett’s rifles which must speak now.”\\n\\nIt was only too true. The “Speedy” was beginning to weigh her anchor,\\nand her intention was evidently to approach the islet. The tide would\\nbe rising for an hour and a half, and the ebb current being already\\nweakened, it would be easy for the brig to advance. But as to entering\\nthe channel, Pencroft, contrary to Ayrton’s opinion, could not believe\\nthat she would dare to attempt it.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually\\nadvanced to the opposite shore, and were now only separated from the\\nmainland by the channel.\\n\\nBeing armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the settlers,\\nin ambush at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy; but, not knowing\\nthe latter to be supplied with long-range rifles, they on their side did\\nnot believe themselves to be exposed. Quite uncovered, therefore, they\\nsurveyed the islet, and examined the shore.\\n\\nTheir illusion was of short duration. Ayrton’s and Gideon Spilett’s\\nrifles then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable\\nintelligence to two of the convicts, for they fell backwards.\\n\\nThen there was a general helter-skelter. The ten others, not even\\nstopping to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to the other\\nside of the islet, tumbled into the boat which had brought them, and\\npulled away with all their strength.\\n\\n“Eight less!” exclaimed Pencroft. “Really, one would have thought that\\nMr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire together!”\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, “this is becoming more\\nserious. The brig is making sail!”\\n\\n“The anchor is weighed!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\n“Yes, and she is already moving.”\\n\\nIn fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass. The\\n“Speedy” was at first held by her anchor; then, when that had been\\nraised, she began to drift towards the shore. The wind was blowing\\nfrom the sea; the jib and the foretopsail were hoisted, and the vessel\\ngradually approached the island.\\n\\nFrom the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched her\\nwithout giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion. What\\ncould be more terrible for the colonists than to be exposed, at a short\\ndistance, to the brig’s guns, without being able to reply with any\\neffect? How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?\\n\\nCyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would\\nbe possible to do. Before long, he would be called upon for his\\ndetermination. But what was it to be? To shut themselves up in Granite\\nHouse, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for months even,\\nsince they had an abundance of provisions? So far good! But after that?\\nThe pirates would not the less be masters of the island, which they\\nwould ravage at their pleasure, and in time, they would end by having\\ntheir revenge on the prisoners in Granite House.\\n\\nHowever, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after all,\\nwould not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would keep\\noutside the islet. He would be still separated from the coast by half a\\nmile, and at that distance his shot could not be very destructive.\\n\\n“Never!” repeated Pencroft, “Bob Harvey will never, if he is a good\\nseaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk the brig,\\nif the sea got up ever so little! And what would become of him without\\nhis vessel?”\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be seen\\nthat she was endeavoring to make the lower end. The breeze was light,\\nand as the current had then lost much of its force, Bob Harvey had\\nabsolute command over his vessel.\\n\\nThe route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to\\nreconnoiter the channel, and she boldly entered it.\\n\\nThe pirate’s design was now only too evident; he wished to bring her\\nbroadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with shell and\\nball to the shot which had till then decimated her crew.\\n\\nSoon the “Speedy” reached the point of the islet; she rounded it with\\nease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the wind, stood\\nacross the mouth of the Mercy.\\n\\n“The scoundrels! they are coming!” said Pencroft.\\n\\nAt that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert, were\\nrejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett.\\n\\nThe reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at\\nthe Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they\\nhad acted wisely. It was better that the colonists should be together at\\nthe moment when they were about to engage in a decisive action. Gideon\\nSpilett and Neb had arrived by dodging behind the rocks, though not\\nwithout attracting a shower of bullets, which had not, however, reached\\nthem.\\n\\n“Spilett! Neb!” cried the engineer. “You are not wounded?”\\n\\n“No,” answered the reporter, “a few bruises only from the ricochet! But\\nthat cursed brig has entered the channel!”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Pencroft, “and in ten minutes she will have anchored\\nbefore Granite House!”\\n\\n“Have you formed any plan, Cyrus?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“We must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time, and the\\nconvicts cannot see us.”\\n\\n“That is, my opinion, too,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but once shut up--”\\n\\n“We must be guided by circumstances,” said the engineer.\\n\\n“Let us be off, then, and make haste!” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Would you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain here?”\\n asked the sailor.\\n\\n“What would be the use of that, Pencroft?” replied Harding. “No. We will\\nnot separate!”\\n\\nThere was not a moment to be lost. The colonists left the Chimneys. A\\nbend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig,\\nbut two or three reports, and the crash of bullets on the rock, told\\nthem that the “Speedy” was at no great distance.\\n\\nTo spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of Granite\\nHouse, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening before, to\\nrush into the large room, was the work of a minute only.\\n\\nIt was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could see the\\n“Speedy,” surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel. The firing was\\nincessant, and shot from the four guns struck blindly, both on the Mercy\\npost, although it was not occupied, and on the Chimneys. The rocks were\\nsplintered, and cheers accompanied each discharge. However, they\\nwere hoping that Granite House would be spared, thanks to Harding’s\\nprecaution of concealing the windows when a shot, piercing the door,\\npenetrated into the passage.\\n\\n“We are discovered!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\nThe colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain that Bob\\nHarvey had thought proper to send a ball through the suspected foliage\\nwhich concealed that part of the cliff. Soon he redoubled his attack,\\nwhen another ball having torn away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping\\naperture in the granite.\\n\\nThe colonists’ situation was desperate. Their retreat was discovered.\\nThey could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles, nor protect the\\nstone, which flew in splinters around them. There was nothing to be\\ndone but to take refuge in the upper passage of Granite House, and leave\\ntheir dwelling to be devastated, when a deep roar was heard, followed by\\nfrightful cries!\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the windows--\\n\\nThe brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout, had just split\\nin two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her\\ncriminal crew!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\n“She has blown up!” cried Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes! blown up, just as if Ayrton had set fire to the powder!” returned\\nPencroft, throwing himself into the lift together with Neb and the lad.\\n\\n“But what has happened?” asked Gideon Spilett, quite stunned by this\\nunexpected catastrophe.\\n\\n“Oh! this time, we shall know--” answered the engineer quickly.\\n\\n“What shall we know?--”\\n\\n“Later! later! Come, Spilett. The main point is that these pirates have\\nbeen exterminated!”\\n\\nAnd Cyrus Harding, hurrying away the reporter and Ayrton, joined\\nPencroft, Neb, and Herbert on the beach.\\n\\nNothing could be seen of the brig, not even her masts. After having been\\nraised by the water-spout, she had fallen on her side, and had sunk in\\nthat position, doubtless in consequence of some enormous leak. But as\\nin that place the channel was not more than twenty feet in depth, it\\nwas certain that the sides of the submerged brig would reappear at low\\nwater.\\n\\nA few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water, a raft\\ncould be seen consisting of spare spars, coops of poultry with their\\noccupants still living, boxes and barrels, which gradually came to the\\nsurface, after having escaped through the hatchways, but no pieces of\\nthe wreck appeared, neither planks from the deck, nor timber from the\\nhull,--which rendered the sudden disappearance of the “Speedy” perfectly\\ninexplicable.\\n\\nHowever, the two masts, which had been broken and escaped from the\\nshrouds and stays came up, and with their sails, some furled and the\\nothers spread. But it was not necessary to wait for the tide to bring\\nup these riches, and Ayrton and Pencroft jumped into the boat with the\\nintention of towing the pieces of wreck either to the beach or to the\\nislet. But just as they were shoving off, an observation from Gideon\\nSpilett arrested them.\\n\\n“What about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the\\nMercy?” said he.\\n\\nIn fact, it would not do to forget that the six men whose boat had gone\\nto pieces on the rocks had landed at Flotsam Point.\\n\\nThey looked in that direction. None of the fugitives were visible. It\\nwas probable that, having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel,\\nthey had fled into the interior of the island.\\n\\n“We will deal with them later,” said Harding. “As they are armed, they\\nwill still be dangerous; but as it is six against six, the chances are\\nequal. To the most pressing business first.”\\n\\nAyrton and Pencroft pulled vigorously towards the wreck.\\n\\nThe sea was calm and the tide very high, as there had been a new moon\\nbut two days before. A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull\\nof the brig could emerge from the water of the channel.\\n\\nAyrton and Pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by means of\\nropes, the ends of which were carried to the beach. There, by the united\\nefforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up. Then the\\nboat picked up all that was floating, coops, barrels, and boxes, which\\nwere immediately carried to the Chimneys.\\n\\nSeveral bodies floated also. Among them, Ayrton recognized that of\\nBob Harvey, which he pointed out to his companion, saying with some\\nemotion,--\\n\\n“That is what I have been, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“But what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!” returned the sailor warmly.\\n\\nIt was singular enough that so few bodies floated. Only five or six were\\ncounted, which were already being carried by the current towards the\\nopen sea. Very probably the convicts had not had time to escape, and\\nthe ship lying over on her side, the greater number of them had remained\\nbelow. Now the current, by carrying the bodies of these miserable men\\nout to sea, would spare the colonists the sad task of burying them in\\nsome corner of their island.\\n\\nFor two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely occupied\\nin hauling up the spars on to the sand, and then in spreading the sails\\nwhich were perfectly uninjured, to dry. They spoke little, for they were\\nabsorbed in their work, but what thoughts occupied their minds!\\n\\nThe possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained, was\\na perfect mine of wealth. In fact, a ship is like a little world in\\nminiature, and the stores of the colony would be increased by a large\\nnumber of useful articles. It would be, on a large scale, equivalent to\\nthe chest found at Flotsam Point.\\n\\n“And besides,” thought Pencroft, “why should it be impossible to refloat\\nthe brig? If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a vessel from\\nthree to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship compared to our\\n‘Bonadventure’! And we could go a long distance in her! We could go\\nanywhere we liked! Captain Harding, Ayrton and I must examine her! She\\nwould be well worth the trouble!”\\n\\nIn fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists’ chances\\nof returning to their native land were singularly increased. But, to\\ndecide this important question, it was necessary to wait until the tide\\nwas quite low, so that every part of the brig’s hull might be examined.\\n\\nWhen their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding and his\\ncompanions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast. They were almost\\nfamished; fortunately, the larder was not far off, and Neb was noted\\nfor being an expeditious cook. They breakfasted, therefore, near the\\nChimneys, and during their repast, as may be supposed, nothing was\\ntalked of but the event which had so miraculously saved the colony.\\n\\n“Miraculous is the word,” repeated Pencroft, “for it must be\\nacknowledged that those rascals blew up just at the right moment!\\nGranite House was beginning to be uncomfortable as a habitation!”\\n\\n“And can you guess, Pencroft,” asked the reporter, “how it happened, or\\nwhat can have occasioned the explosion?”\\n\\n“Oh! Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple,” answered Pencroft. “A convict\\nvessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war! Convicts are not sailors.\\nOf course the powder-magazine was open, and as they were firing\\nincessantly, some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel!”\\n\\n“Captain Harding,” said Herbert, “what astonishes me is that the\\nexplosion has not produced more effect. The report was not loud, and\\nbesides there are so few planks and timbers torn out. It seems as if the\\nship had rather foundered than blown up.”\\n\\n“Does that astonish you, my boy?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“Yes, captain.”\\n\\n“And it astonishes me also, Herbert,” replied he, “but when we visit the\\nhull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter.”\\n\\n“Why, captain,” said Pencroft, “you don’t suppose that the ‘Speedy’\\nsimply foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock?”\\n\\n“Why not,” observed Neb, “if there are rocks in the channel?”\\n\\n“Nonsense, Neb,” answered Pencroft, “you did not look at the right\\nmoment. An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well,\\nrose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side. Now, if\\nshe had only struck, she would have sunk quietly and gone to the bottom\\nlike an honest vessel.”\\n\\n“It was just because she was not an honest vessel!” returned Neb.\\n\\n“Well, we shall soon see, Pencroft,” said the engineer.\\n\\n“We shall soon see,” rejoined the sailor, “but I would wager my\\nhead there are no rocks in the channel. Look here, captain, to speak\\ncandidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the\\noccurrence?”\\n\\nCyrus Harding did not answer.\\n\\n“At any rate,” said Gideon Spilett, “whether rock or explosion, you will\\nagree, Pencroft, that it occurred just in the nick of time!”\\n\\n“Yes! yes!” replied the sailor, “but that is not the question. I ask\\nCaptain Harding if he sees anything supernatural in all this.”\\n\\n“I cannot say, Pencroft,” said the engineer. “That is all the answer I\\ncan make.”\\n\\nA reply which did not satisfy Pencroft at all. He stuck to “an\\nexplosion,” and did not wish to give it up. He would never consent\\nto admit that in that channel, with its fine sandy bed, just like\\nthe beach, which he had often crossed at low water, there could be an\\nunknown rock.\\n\\nAnd besides, at the time the brig foundered, it was high water, that is\\nto say, there was enough water to carry the vessel clear over any rocks\\nwhich would not be uncovered at low tide. Therefore, there could not\\nhave been a collision. Therefore, the vessel had not struck. So she had\\nblown up.\\n\\nAnd it must be confessed that the sailor’s arguments were reasonable.\\n\\nTowards half-past one, the colonists embarked in the boat to visit the\\nwreck. It was to be regretted that the brig’s two boats had not been\\nsaved; but one, as has been said, had gone to pieces at the mouth of the\\nMercy, and was absolutely useless; the other had disappeared when the\\nbrig went down, and had not again been seen, having doubtless been\\ncrushed.\\n\\nThe hull of the “Speedy” was just beginning to issue from the water.\\nThe brig was lying right over on her side, for her masts being broken,\\npressed down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock, the\\nkeel was visible along her whole length. She had been regularly turned\\nover by the inexplicable but frightful submarine action, which had been\\nat the same time manifested by an enormous water-spout.\\n\\nThe settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide went\\ndown, they could ascertain, if not the cause which had occasioned the\\ncatastrophe, at least the effect produced.\\n\\nTowards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet from\\nthe beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig were frightfully torn.\\nOver a length of at least twenty feet there opened two large leaks,\\nwhich would be impossible to stop up. Not only had the copper sheathing\\nand the planks disappeared, reduced, no doubt, to powder, but also the\\nribs, the iron bolts, and treenails which united them. From the entire\\nlength of the hull to the stern the false keel had been separated with\\nan unaccountable violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in\\nseveral places, was split in all its length.\\n\\n“I’ve a notion!” exclaimed Pencroft, “that this vessel will be difficult\\nto get afloat again.”\\n\\n“It will be impossible,” said Ayrton.\\n\\n“At any rate,” observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, “the explosion,\\nif there has been one, has produced singular effects! It has split the\\nlower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and topsides!\\nThese great rents appear rather to have been made by a rock than by the\\nexplosion of a powder-magazine.”\\n\\n“There is not a rock in the channel!” answered the sailor. “I will admit\\nanything you like, except the rock.”\\n\\n“Let us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig,” said the\\nengineer; “perhaps we shall then know what to think of the cause of her\\ndestruction.”\\n\\nThis was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides, to\\ntake an inventory of all the treasures on board, and to arrange their\\npreservation.\\n\\nAccess to the interior of the brig was now easy. The tide was still\\ngoing down and the deck was practicable. The ballast, composed of heavy\\nmasses of iron, had broken through in several places. The noise of the\\nsea could be heard as it rushed out at the holes in the hull.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced along the\\nshattered deck. Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as they had\\nbeen but a very short time in the water, their contents were perhaps\\nuninjured.\\n\\nThey then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety. The\\nwater would not return for several hours, and these hours must be\\nemployed in the most profitable way. Ayrton and Pencroft had, at the\\nentrance made in the hull, discovered tackle, which would serve to hoist\\nup the barrels and chests. The boat received them and transported them\\nto the shore. They took the articles as they came, intending to sort\\nthem afterwards.\\n\\nAt any rate, the settlers saw at once, with extreme satisfaction, that\\nthe brig possessed a very varied cargo--an assortment of all sorts of\\narticles, utensils, manufactured goods, and tools--such as the ships\\nwhich make the great coasting-trade of Polynesia are usually laden with.\\nIt was probable that they would find a little of everything, and they\\nagreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of Lincoln\\nIsland.\\n\\nHowever--and Cyrus Harding observed it in silent astonishment--not only,\\nas has been said, had the hull of the brig enormously suffered from the\\nshock, whatever it was, that had occasioned the catastrophe, but the\\ninterior arrangements had been destroyed, especially towards the bows.\\nPartitions and stanchions were smashed, as if some tremendous shell had\\nburst in the interior of the brig. The colonists could easily go fore\\nand aft, after having removed the cases as they were extricated. They\\nwere not heavy bales, which would have been difficult to remove,\\nbut simple packages, of which the stowage, besides, was no longer\\nrecognizable.\\n\\nThe colonists then reached the stern of the brig--the part formerly\\nsurmounted by the poop. It was there that, following Ayrton’s\\ndirections, they must look for the powder-magazine. Cyrus Harding\\nthought that it had not exploded; that it was possible some barrels\\nmight be saved, and that the powder, which is usually enclosed in metal\\ncoverings might not have suffered from contact with the water.\\n\\nThis, in fact, was just what had happened. They extricated from among\\na large number of shot twenty barrels, the insides of which were lined\\nwith copper. Pencroft was convinced by the evidence of his own eyes that\\nthe destruction of the “Speedy” could not be attributed to an explosion.\\nThat part of the hull in which the magazine was situated was, moreover,\\nthat which had suffered least.\\n\\n“It may be so,” said the obstinate sailor; “but as to a rock, there is\\nnot one in the channel!”\\n\\n“Then, how did it happen?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“I don’t know,” answered Pencroft, “Captain Harding doesn’t know, and\\nnobody knows or ever will know!”\\n\\nSeveral hours had passed during these researches, and the tide began to\\nflow. Work must be suspended for the present. There was no fear of the\\nbrig being carried away by the sea, for she was already fixed as firmly\\nas if moored by her anchors.\\n\\nThey could, therefore, without inconvenience, wait until the next day to\\nresume operations; but, as to the vessel itself, she was doomed, and it\\nwould be best to hasten to save the remains of her hull, as she would\\nnot be long in disappearing in the quicksands of the channel.\\n\\nIt was now five o’clock in the evening. It had been a hard day’s work\\nfor the men. They ate with good appetite, and notwithstanding their\\nfatigue, they could not resist, after dinner, their desire of inspecting\\nthe cases which composed the cargo of the “Speedy.”\\n\\nMost of them contained clothes, which, as may be believed, was well\\nreceived. There were enough to clothe a whole colony--linen for every\\none’s use, shoes for every one’s feet.\\n\\n“We are too rich!” exclaimed Pencroft, “But what are we going to do with\\nall this?”\\n\\nAnd every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he\\ncaught sight of the barrels of gunpowder, firearms and sidearms,\\nballs of cotton, implements of husbandry, carpenter’s, joiner’s, and\\nblacksmith’s tools, and boxes of all kinds of seeds, not in the least\\ninjured by their short sojourn in the water. Ah, two years before,\\nhow these things would have been prized! And now, even though the\\nindustrious colonists had provided themselves with tools, these\\ntreasures would find their use.\\n\\nThere was no want of space in the store-rooms of Granite House, but that\\ndaytime would not allow them to stow away the whole. It would not do\\nalso to forget that the six survivors of the “Speedy’s” crew had landed\\non the island, for they were in all probability scoundrels of the\\ndeepest dye, and it was necessary that the colonists should be on their\\nguard against them. Although the bridges over the Mercy were raised,\\nthe convicts would not be stopped by a river or a stream and, rendered\\ndesperate, these wretches would be capable of anything.\\n\\nThey would see later what plan it would be best to follow; but in the\\nmeantime it was necessary to mount guard over cases and packages heaped\\nup near the Chimneys, and thus the settlers employed themselves in turn\\nduring the night.\\n\\nThe morning came, however, without the convicts having attempted any\\nattack. Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite House, would\\nhave quickly given the alarm. The three following days--the 19th, 20th,\\nand 21st of October--were employed in saving everything of value, or of\\nany use whatever, either from the cargo or rigging of the brig. At low\\ntide they overhauled the hold--at high tide they stowed away the rescued\\narticles. A great part of the copper sheathing had been torn from the\\nhull, which every day sank lower. But before the sand had swallowed the\\nheavy things which had fallen through the bottom, Ayrton and Pencroft,\\ndiving to the bed of the channel, recovered the chains and anchors of\\nthe brig, the iron of her ballast, and even four guns, which, floated by\\nmeans of empty casks, were brought to shore.\\n\\nIt may be seen that the arsenal of the colony had gained by the\\nwreck, as well as the storerooms of Granite House. Pencroft, always\\nenthusiastic in his projects, already spoke of constructing a battery\\nto command the channel and the mouth of the river. With four guns,\\nhe engaged to prevent any fleet, “however powerful it might be,” from\\nventuring into the waters of Lincoln Island!\\n\\nIn the meantime, when nothing remained of the brig but a useless hulk,\\nbad weather came on, which soon finished her. Cyrus Harding had intended\\nto blow her up, so as to collect the remains on the shore, but a strong\\ngale from the northeast and a heavy sea compelled him to economize his\\npowder.\\n\\nIn fact, on the night of the 23rd, the hull entirely broke up, and some\\nof the wreck was cast up on the beach.\\n\\nAs to the papers on board, it is useless to say that, although he\\ncarefully searched the lockers of the poop, Harding did not discover\\nany trace of them. The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that\\nconcerned either the captain or the owners of the “Speedy,” and, as the\\nname of her port was not painted on her counter, there was nothing which\\nwould tell them her nationality. However, by the shape of her boats\\nAyrton and Pencroft believed that the brig was of English build.\\n\\nA week after the castrophe--or, rather, after the fortunate, though\\ninexplicable, event to which the colony owed its preservation--nothing\\nmore could be seen of the vessel, even at low tide. The wreck had\\ndisappeared, and Granite House was enriched by nearly all it had\\ncontained.\\n\\nHowever, the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would\\ndoubtless never have been cleared away if, on the 30th of November, Neb,\\nstrolling on the beach, had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder,\\nbearing traces of explosion. The edges of this cylinder were twisted and\\nbroken, as if they had been subjected to the action of some explosive\\nsubstance.\\n\\nNeb brought this piece of metal to his master, who was then occupied\\nwith his companions in the workshop of the Chimneys.\\n\\nCyrus Harding examined the cylinder attentively, then, turning to\\nPencroft,--\\n\\n“You persist, my friend,” said he, “in maintaining that the ‘Speedy’ was\\nnot lost in consequence of a collision?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain,” answered the sailor. “You know as well as I do that\\nthere are no rocks in the channel.”\\n\\n“But suppose she had run against this piece of iron?” said the engineer,\\nshowing the broken cylinder.\\n\\n“What, that bit of pipe!” exclaimed Pencroft in a tone of perfect\\nincredulity.\\n\\n“My friends,” resumed Harding, “you remember that before she foundered\\nthe brig rose on the summit of a regular waterspout?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain,” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“Well, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout? It was\\nthis,” said the engineer, holding up the broken tube.\\n\\n“That?” returned Pencroft.\\n\\n“Yes! This cylinder is all that remains of a torpedo!”\\n\\n“A torpedo!” exclaimed the engineer’s companions.\\n\\n“And who put the torpedo there?” demanded Pencroft, who did not like to\\nyield.\\n\\n“All that I can tell you is, that it was not I,” answered Cyrus Harding;\\n“but it was there, and you have been able to judge of its incomparable\\npower!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\nSo, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo.\\nCyrus Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of the Union,\\nhe had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction. It\\nwas under the action of this cylinder, charged with some explosive\\nsubstance, nitro-glycerine, picrate, or some other material of the same\\nnature, that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome, the\\nbottom of the brig crushed in, and she had sunk instantly, the damage\\ndone to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat\\nher. The “Speedy” had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would\\nhave destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing-boat!\\n\\nYes! all was explained, everything--except the presence of the torpedo\\nin the waters of the channel!\\n\\n“My friends, then,” said Cyrus Harding, “we can no longer be in doubt\\nas to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps,\\nabandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be\\nacquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these\\ntwo years. Who this beneficent stranger is, whose intervention has, so\\nfortunately for us, been manifested on many occasions, I cannot imagine.\\nWhat his object can be in acting thus, in concealing himself after\\nrendering us so many services, I cannot understand: But his services are\\nnot the less real, and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of\\nprodigious power, could render them. Ayrton is indebted to him as much\\nas we are, for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after\\nthe fall from the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document,\\nwho placed the bottle in the channel, and who has made known to us the\\nsituation of our companion. I will add that it was he who guided that\\nchest, provided with everything we wanted, and stranded it on Flotsam\\nPoint; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the\\nisland, which permitted you to land; that it was he who fired that\\nbullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was he who plunged that\\ntorpedo into the channel, which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all\\nthose inexplicable events, for which we could not assign a reason, are\\ndue to this mysterious being. Therefore, whoever he may be, whether\\nshipwrecked, or exiled on our island, we shall be ungrateful, if we\\nthink ourselves freed from gratitude towards him. We have contracted a\\ndebt, and I hope that we shall one day pay it.”\\n\\n“You are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus,” replied Gideon Spilett.\\n“Yes, there is an almost all-powerful being, hidden in some part of the\\nisland, and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony.\\nI will add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which\\nborder on the supernatural, if in the events of practical life the\\nsupernatural were recognizable. Is it he who is in secret communication\\nwith us by the well in Granite House, and has he thus a knowledge of all\\nour plans? Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her\\nfirst cruise? Was it he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed the\\ndugong? Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from\\nthe waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not\\nhave been able to act? If it was he, he possesses a power which renders\\nhim master of the elements.”\\n\\nThe reporter’s reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be so.\\n\\n“Yes,” rejoined Cyrus Harding, “if the intervention of a human being is\\nnot more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means\\nof action beyond those possessed by humanity. There is a mystery still,\\nbut if we discover the man, the mystery will be discovered also. The\\nquestion, then, is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous\\nbeing, or ought we to do everything to find him out? What is your\\nopinion on the matter?”\\n\\n“My opinion,” said Pencroft, “is that, whoever he may be, he is a brave\\nman, and he has my esteem!”\\n\\n“Be it so,” answered Harding, “but that is not an answer, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“Master,” then said Neb, “my idea is, that we may search as long as we\\nlike for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that we shall\\nnot discover him till he pleases.”\\n\\n“That’s not bad, what you say, Neb,” observed Pencroft.\\n\\n“I am of Neb’s opinion,” said Gideon Spilett, “but that is no reason for\\nnot attempting the adventure. Whether we find this mysterious being or\\nnot, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him.”\\n\\n“And you, my boy, give us your opinion,” said the engineer, turning to\\nHerbert.\\n\\n“Oh,” cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, “how I should\\nlike to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now saved us!”\\n\\n“Of course, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “so would I and all of us. I am\\nnot inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see this individual\\nface to face! It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall, strong,\\nwith a splendid beard, radiant hair, and that he must be seated on\\nclouds, a great ball in his hands!”\\n\\n“But, Pencroft,” answered Spilett, “you are describing a picture of the\\nCreator.”\\n\\n“Possibly, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “but that is how I imagine\\nhim!”\\n\\n“And you, Ayrton?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, “I can give you no better advice in\\nthis matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish me to join you\\nin your researches, I am ready to follow you.\\n\\n“I thank you, Ayrton,” answered Cyrus Harding, “but I should like a more\\ndirect answer to the question I put to you. You are our companion; you\\nhave already endangered your life several times for us, and you, as\\nwell as the rest, ought to be consulted in the matter of any important\\ndecision. Speak, therefore.”\\n\\n“Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, “I think that we ought to do\\neverything to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is alone.\\nPerhaps he is suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be renewed. I, too,\\nas you said, have a debt of gratitude to pay him. It was he, it could be\\nonly he who must have come to Tabor Island, who found there the wretch\\nyou knew, and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man\\nthere to be saved. Therefore it is, thanks to him, that I have become a\\nman again. No, I will never forget him!”\\n\\n“That is settled, then,” said Cyrus Harding. “We will begin our\\nresearches as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the island\\nunexplored. We will search into its most secret recesses, and will\\nhope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our\\nintentions!”\\n\\nFor several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and\\nthe harvest. Before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown\\nparts of the island into execution, they wished to get all possible work\\nfinished. It was also the time for collecting the various vegetables\\nfrom the Tabor Island plants. All was stowed away, and happily there was\\nno want of room in Granite House, in which they might have housed all\\nthe treasures of the island. The products of the colony were there,\\nmethodically arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed,\\nsheltered as much from animals as from man.\\n\\nThere was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite.\\nMany natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged\\neither by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus became a general\\nwarehouse, containing all the provisions, arms, tools, and spare\\nutensils--in a word, all the stores of the colony.\\n\\nAs to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces of\\nordnance, which, at Pencroft’s entreaty, were hoisted by means of tackle\\nand pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were made between\\nthe windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen\\nthrough the granite cliff. From this height they commanded all Union\\nBay. It was like a little Gibraltar, and any vessel anchored off the\\nislet would inevitably be exposed to the fire of this aerial battery.\\n\\n“Captain,” said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November, “now that\\nour fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing if we tried\\nthe range of our guns.”\\n\\n“Do you think that is useful?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“It is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are we to\\nknow to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we\\nare provided?”\\n\\n“Try them, Pencroft,” replied the engineer. “However, I think that in\\nmaking the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder,\\nthe supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle\\nwhich will never fail us.”\\n\\n“Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?” asked the reporter,\\nwho was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite\\nHouse.\\n\\n“I believe so. However,” added the engineer, “we will be prudent.” The\\nengineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make.\\nMade of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they ought consequently to be\\nable to bear a considerable charge, and also have an enormous range.\\nIn fact, as regards practical effect, the transit described by the ball\\nought to be as extended as possible, and this tension could only be\\nobtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with\\na very great initial velocity.\\n\\n“Now,” said Harding to his companions, “the initial velocity is in\\nproportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of\\nthese pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the highest\\npossible power of resistance, and steel is incontestably that metal of\\nall others which resists the best. I have, therefore, reason to believe\\nthat our guns will bear without risk the expansion of the pyroxyle gas,\\nand will give excellent results.”\\n\\n“We shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them!”\\n answered Pencroft.\\n\\nIt is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order.\\nSince they had been taken from the water, the sailor had bestowed great\\ncare upon them. How many hours he had spent, in rubbing, greasing, and\\npolishing them, and in cleaning the mechanism! And now the pieces were\\nas brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the United States\\nNavy.\\n\\nOn this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the colony,\\nincluding Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were successively tried.\\nThey were charged with pyroxyle, taking into consideration its explosive\\npower, which, as has been said, is four times that of ordinary powder:\\nthe projectile to be fired was cylindroconic.\\n\\nPencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to fire.\\n\\nAt Harding’s signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet,\\nfell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with\\nexactitude.\\n\\nThe second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and\\nthe shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House,\\nmade it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and\\nfired it, and very proud he was of his first shot. Pencroft only was\\nprouder than he! Such a shot, the honor of which belonged to his dear\\nboy.\\n\\nThe third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side\\nof Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having\\nricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray.\\n\\nFor the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly increased the charge, so\\nas to try its extreme range. Then, all standing aside for fear of its\\nbursting, the match was lighted by means of a long cord.\\n\\nA tremendous report was heard, but the piece had held good, and the\\ncolonists rushing to the windows, saw the shot graze the rocks of\\nMandible Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and disappear in\\nShark Gulf.\\n\\n“Well, captain,” exclaimed Pencroft, whose cheers might have rivaled the\\nreports themselves, “what do you say of our battery? All the pirates in\\nthe Pacific have only to present themselves before Granite House! Not\\none can land there now without our permission!”\\n\\n“Believe me, Pencroft,” replied the engineer, “it would be better not to\\nhave to make the experiment.”\\n\\n“Well,” said the sailor, “what ought to be done with regard to those\\nsix villains who are roaming about the island? Are we to leave them\\nto overrun our forests, our fields, our plantations? These pirates are\\nregular jaguars, and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat\\nthem as such! What do you think, Ayrton?” added Pencroft, turning to his\\ncompanion.\\n\\nAyrton hesitated at first to reply, and Cyrus Harding regretted that\\nPencroft had so thoughtlessly put this question. And he was much moved\\nwhen Ayrton replied in a humble tone,--\\n\\n“I have been one of those jaguars, Mr. Pencroft. I have no right to\\nspeak.”\\n\\nAnd with a slow step he walked away.\\n\\nPencroft understood.\\n\\n“What a brute I am!” he exclaimed. “Poor Ayrton! He has as much right to\\nspeak here as any one!”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Gideon Spilett, “but his reserve does him honor, and it is\\nright to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past.”\\n\\n“Certainly, Mr. Spilett,” answered the sailor, “and there is no fear of\\nmy doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than cause Ayrton\\nany pain! But to return to the question. It seems to me that these\\nruffians have no right to any pity, and that we ought to rid the island\\nof them as soon as possible.”\\n\\n“Is that your opinion, Pencroft?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“Quite my opinion.”\\n\\n“And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had\\ncommitted some fresh act of hostility against us?”\\n\\n“Isn’t what they have done already enough?” asked Pencroft, who did not\\nunderstand these scruples.\\n\\n“They may adopt other sentiments!” said Harding, “and perhaps repent.”\\n\\n“They repent!” exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.\\n\\n“Pencroft, think of Ayrton!” said Herbert, taking the sailor’s hand. “He\\nbecame an honest man again!”\\n\\nPencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had never\\nthought of his proposal being met with any objection. His rough nature\\ncould not allow that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who\\nhad landed on the island with Bob Harvey’s accomplices, the murderers of\\nthe crew of the “Speedy,” and he looked upon them as wild beasts which\\nought to be destroyed without delay and without remorse.\\n\\n“Come!” said be. “Everybody is against me! You wish to be generous to\\nthose villains! Very well; I hope we mayn’t repent it!”\\n\\n“What danger shall we run,” said Herbert, “if we take care to be always\\non our guard?”\\n\\n“Hum!” observed the reporter, who had not given any decided opinion.\\n“They are six and well armed. If they each lay hid in a corner, and each\\nfired at one of us, they would soon be masters of the colony!”\\n\\n“Why have they not done so?” said Herbert. “No doubt because it was not\\ntheir interest to do it. Besides, we are six also.”\\n\\n“Well, well!” replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have convinced.\\n“Let us leave these good people to do what they like, and don’t think\\nanything more about them!”\\n\\n“Come, Pencroft,” said Neb, “don’t make yourself out so bad as all that!\\nSuppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you, within good\\nrange of your guns, you would not fire.”\\n\\n“I would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb,” replied Pencroft\\ncoldly.\\n\\n“Pencroft,” said the engineer, “you have always shown much deference to\\nmy advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?”\\n\\n“I will do as you please, Captain Harding,” answered the sailor, who was\\nnot at all convinced.\\n\\n“Very well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are attacked\\nfirst.”\\n\\nThus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon, although\\nPencroft augured nothing good from it. They were not to attack them, but\\nwere to be on their guard. After all, the island was large and fertile.\\nIf any sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts,\\nthese wretches might perhaps be reclaimed. Was it not their interest in\\nthe situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life? At\\nany rate, for humanity’s sake alone, it would be right to wait. The\\ncolonists would no longer as before, be able to go and come without\\nfear. Hitherto they had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six\\nconvicts of the worst description, perhaps, were roaming over their\\nisland. It was serious, certainly, and to less brave men, it would have\\nbeen security lost! No matter! At present, the colonists had reason on\\ntheir side against Pencroft. Would they be right in the future? That\\nremained to be seen.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\nHowever, the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete\\nexploration of the island which had been decided upon, and which would\\nhave two objects: to discover the mysterious being whose existence was\\nnow indisputable, and at the same time to find out what had become of\\nthe pirates, what retreat they had chosen, what sort of life they were\\nleading, and what was to be feared from them. Cyrus Harding wished\\nto set out without delay; but as the expedition would be of some days\\nduration, it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and\\ntools in order to facilitate the organization of the encampments. One\\nof the onagers, however, having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed\\nat present, and a few days’ rest was necessary. The departure was,\\ntherefore, put off for a week, until the 20th of November. The month\\nof November in this latitude corresponds to the month of May in the\\nnorthern zones. It was, therefore, the fine season. The sun was entering\\nthe tropic of Capricorn, and gave the longest days in the year. The time\\nwas, therefore, very favorable for the projected expedition, which,\\nif it did not accomplish its principal object, would at any rate be\\nfruitful in discoveries, especially of natural productions, since\\nHarding proposed to explore those dense forests of the Far West, which\\nstretched to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.\\n\\nDuring the nine days which preceded their departure, it was agreed that\\nthe work on Prospect Heights should be finished off.\\n\\nMoreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral, where the\\ndomesticated animals required his care. It was decided that he should\\nspend two days there, and return to Granite House after having liberally\\nsupplied the stables.\\n\\nAs he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one\\nof them to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than\\nformerly. Ayrton replied that this was unnecessary, as he was enough\\nfor the work, and that besides he apprehended no danger. If anything\\noccurred at the corral, or in the neighborhood, he could instantly warn\\nthe colonists by sending a telegram to Granite House.\\n\\nAyrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one onager,\\nand two hours after, the electric wire announced that he had found all\\nin order at the corral.\\n\\nDuring these two days Harding busied himself in executing a project\\nwhich would completely guard Granite House against any surprise. It was\\nnecessary to completely conceal the opening of the old outlet, which\\nwas already walled up and partly hidden under grass and plants, at the\\nsouthern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing was easier, since if the level\\nof the lake was raised two or three feet, the opening would be quite\\nbeneath it. Now, to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at\\nthe two openings made by the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine\\nand Falls River.\\n\\nThe colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides did not\\nexceed eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly erected by\\nmeans of well-cemented blocks of stone.\\n\\nThis work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that at that\\npart of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage through which the\\noverflow of the lake formerly escaped.\\n\\nOf course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite House and\\nworked the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the water could not\\nfail. The lift once raised, this sure and comfortable retreat would be\\nsafe from any surprise.\\n\\nThis work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and\\nHerbert found time to make an expedition to Port Balloon, The sailor was\\nvery anxious to know if the little creek in which the “Bonadventure” was\\nmoored, had been visited by the convicts.\\n\\n“These gentlemen,” he observed, “landed on the south coast, and if they\\nfollowed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have discovered the\\nlittle harbor, and in that case, I wouldn’t give half-a-dollar for our\\n‘Bonadventure.’”\\n\\nPencroft’s apprehensions were not without foundation, and a visit\\nto Port Balloon appeared to be very desirable. The sailor and his\\ncompanions set off on the 10th of November, after dinner, well armed.\\nPencroft, ostentatiously slipping two bullets into each barrel of his\\nrifle, shook his head in a way which betokened nothing good to any one\\nwho approached too near him, whether “man or beast,” as he said. Gideon\\nSpilett and Herbert also took their guns, and about three o’clock all\\nthree left Granite House.\\n\\nNeb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they had\\ncrossed, he raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot should\\nannounce the colonists’ return, and that at the signal Neb should return\\nand reestablish the communication between the two banks of the river.\\n\\nThe little band advanced directly along the road which led to the\\nsouthern coast of the island. This was only a distance of three miles\\nand a half, but Gideon Spilett and his companions took two hours to\\ntraverse it. They examined all the border of the road, the thick forest,\\nas well as Tabor Marsh. They found no trace of the fugitives who, no\\ndoubt, not having yet discovered the number of the colonists, or the\\nmeans of defense which they had at their disposal, had gained the less\\naccessible parts of the island.\\n\\nArrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that\\nthe “Bonadventure” was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek. However,\\nPort Balloon was so well hidden among high rocks, that it could scarcely\\nbe discovered either from the land or the sea.\\n\\n“Come,” said Pencroft, “the blackguards have not been there yet. Long\\ngrass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in the Far\\nWest.”\\n\\n“And it’s very lucky, for if they had found the ‘Bonadventure’,” added\\nHerbert, “they would have gone off in her, and we should have been\\nprevented from returning to Tabor Island.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” remarked the reporter, “it will be important to take a\\ndocument there which will make known the situation of Lincoln Island,\\nand Ayrton’s new residence, in case the Scotch yacht returns to fetch\\nhim.”\\n\\n“Well, the ‘Bonadventure’ is always there, Mr. Spilett,” answered the\\nsailor. “She and her crew are ready to start at a moment’s notice!”\\n\\n“I think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our\\nexploration of the island is finished. It is possible after all that the\\nstranger, if we manage to find him, may know as much about Tabor Island\\nas about Lincoln Island. Do not forget that he is certainly the author\\nof the document, and he may, perhaps, know how far we may count on the\\nreturn of the yacht!”\\n\\n“But!” exclaimed Pencroft, “who in the world can he be? The fellow knows\\nus and we know nothing about him! If he is a simple castaway, why should\\nhe conceal himself! We are honest men, I suppose, and the society of\\nhonest men isn’t unpleasant to any one. Did he come here voluntarily?\\nCan he leave the island if he likes? Is he here still? Will he remain\\nany longer?”\\n\\nChatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on board and\\nlooked about the deck of the “Bonadventure.” All at once, the sailor\\nhaving examined the bitts to which the cable of the anchor was\\nsecured,--\\n\\n“Hallo,” he cried, “this is queer!”\\n\\n“What is the matter, Pencroft?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“The matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!”\\n\\nAnd Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt itself.\\n\\n“What, it was not you?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“No! I can swear to it. This is a reef knot, and I always make a running\\nbowline.”\\n\\n“You must be mistaken, Pencroft.”\\n\\n“I am not mistaken!” declared the sailor. “My hand does it so naturally,\\nand one’s hand is never mistaken!”\\n\\n“Then can the convicts have been on board?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“I know nothing about that,” answered Pencroft, “but what is certain,\\nis that some one has weighed the ‘Bonadventure’s’ anchor and dropped it\\nagain! And look here, here is another proof! The cable of the anchor has\\nbeen run out, and its service is no longer at the hawse-hole. I repeat\\nthat some one has been using our vessel!”\\n\\n“But if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or\\nrather gone off with her.”\\n\\n“Gone off! where to--to Tabor Island?” replied Pencroft. “Do you think,\\nthey would risk themselves in a boat of such small tonnage?”\\n\\n“We must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet,” rejoined the\\nreporter.\\n\\n“However that may be,” said the sailor, “as sure as my name is\\nBonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our ‘Bonadventure’ has sailed\\nwithout us!”\\n\\nThe sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert could\\ndispute his statement. It was evident that the vessel had been moved,\\nmore or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon. As to the\\nsailor, he had not the slightest doubt that the anchor had been raised\\nand then dropped again. Now, what was the use of these two maneuvers,\\nunless the vessel had been employed in some expedition?\\n\\n“But how was it we did not see the ‘Bonadventure’ pass in the sight of\\nthe island?” observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward\\nevery possible objection.\\n\\n“Why, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “they would only have to start\\nin the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of sight of the\\nisland in two hours.”\\n\\n“Well,” resumed Gideon Spilett, “I ask again, what object could the\\nconvicts have had in using the ‘Bonadventure,’ and why, after they had\\nmade use of her, should they have brought her back to port?”\\n\\n“Why, Mr. Spilett,” replied the sailor, “we must put that among the\\nunaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The chief\\nthing is that the ‘Bonadventure’ was there, and she is there now. Only,\\nunfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time, we shall very\\nlikely not find her again in her place!”\\n\\n“Then, Pencroft,” said Herbert, “would it not be wisest to bring the\\n‘Bonadventure’ off to Granite House?”\\n\\n“Yes and no,” answered Pencroft, “or rather no. The mouth of the Mercy\\nis a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there.”\\n\\n“But by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the Chimneys?”\\n\\n“Perhaps yes,” replied Pencroft. “At any rate, since we must leave\\nGranite House for a long expedition, I think the ‘Bonadventure’ will be\\nsafer here during our absence, and we shall do best to leave her here\\nuntil the island is rid of these blackguards.”\\n\\n“That is exactly my opinion,” said the reporter. “At any rate in the\\nevent of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would be at\\nthe mouth of the Mercy.”\\n\\n“But suppose the convicts pay her another visit,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Well, my boy,” replied Pencroft, “not finding her here, they would not\\nbe long in finding her on the sands of Granite House, and, during our\\nabsence, nothing could hinder them from seizing her! I agree, therefore,\\nwith Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in Port Balloon. But, if on our\\nreturn we have not rid the island of those rascals, it will be prudent\\nto bring our boat to Granite House, until the time when we need not fear\\nany unpleasant visits.”\\n\\n“That’s settled. Let us be off,” said the reporter.\\n\\nPencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to Granite House,\\ntold the engineer all that had passed, and the latter approved of their\\narrangements both for the present and the future. He also promised the\\nsailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the\\nislet and the coast, so as to ascertain if it would not be possible\\nto make an artificial harbor there by means of dams. In this way, the\\n“Bonadventure” would be always within reach, under the eyes of the\\ncolonists, and if necessary, under lock and key.\\n\\nThat evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to bring from\\nthe corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize to the\\nplateau. Singularly enough, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of\\nthe despatch, as he was accustomed to do. This could not but astonish\\nthe engineer. But it might be that Ayrton was not at that moment in the\\ncorral, or even that he was on his way back to Granite House. In fact,\\ntwo days had already passed since his departure, and it had been decided\\nthat on the evening of the 10th or at the latest the morning of the\\n11th, he should return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to\\nappear on Prospect Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge\\nso as to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented\\nhimself.\\n\\nBut up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It was,\\ntherefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an immediate\\nreply.\\n\\nThe bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute.\\n\\nThe colonists’ uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was Ayrton no\\nlonger at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no longer control\\nover his movements? Could they go to the corral in this dark night?\\n\\nThey consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain.\\n\\n“But,” said Herbert, “perhaps some accident has happened to the\\ntelegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?”\\n\\n“That may be,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Wait till to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding. “It is possible, indeed,\\nthat Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we have not\\nreceived his.”\\n\\nThey waited, of course not without some anxiety.\\n\\nAt dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the electric\\ncurrent along the wire and received no reply.\\n\\nHe tried again: the same result.\\n\\n“Off to the corral,” said he.\\n\\n“And well armed!” added Pencroft.\\n\\nIt was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left alone\\nand that Neb should remain there. After having accompanied his friends\\nto Creek Glycerine, he raised the bridge; and waiting behind a tree he\\nwatched for the return of either his companions or Ayrton.\\n\\nIn the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting to\\nforce the passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on them,\\nand as a last resource he was to take refuge in Granite House, where,\\nthe lift once raised, he would be in safety.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to repair\\nto the corral, and if they did not find Ayrton, search the neighboring\\nwoods.\\n\\nAt six o’clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions\\nhad passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself behind a small mound\\ncrowned by several dragon trees, on the left bank of the stream.\\n\\nThe colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights,\\nimmediately took the road to the corral. They shouldered their guns,\\nready to fire on the slightest hostile demonstration. The two rifles and\\nthe two guns had been loaded with ball.\\n\\nThe wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have\\nconcealed the convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been\\nreally formidable.\\n\\nThe colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them,\\nsometimes running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the wood,\\nbut always quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual. And\\nthey could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be\\nsurprised, but would bark at the least appearance of danger.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which\\nconnected the corral with Granite House. After walking for nearly two\\nmiles, they had not as yet discovered any explanation of the difficulty.\\nThe posts were in good order, the wire regularly extended. However, at\\nthat moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack,\\nand on arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped,\\nexclaiming,--\\n\\n“The wire is broken!”\\n\\nHis companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad\\nwas standing. The post was rooted up and lying across the path. The\\nunexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was evident\\nthat the despatches from Granite House had not been received at the\\ncorral, nor those from the corral at Granite House.\\n\\n“It wasn’t the wind that blew down this post,” observed Pencroft.\\n\\n“No,” replied Gideon Spilett. “The earth has been dug up round its foot,\\nand it has been torn up by the hand of man.”\\n\\n“Besides, the wire is broken,” added Herbert, showing that the wire had\\nbeen snapped.\\n\\n“Is the fracture recent?” asked Harding.\\n\\n“Yes,” answered Herbert, “it has certainly been done quite lately.”\\n\\n“To the corral! to the corral!” exclaimed the sailor.\\n\\nThe colonists were now half way between Granite House and the corral,\\nhaving still two miles and a half to go. They pressed forward with\\nredoubled speed.\\n\\nIndeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had occurred in\\nthe corral. No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not\\narrived, but this was not the reason why his companions were so uneasy,\\nfor, a more unaccountable circumstance, Ayrton, who had promised to\\nreturn the evening before, had not reappeared. In short, it was not\\nwithout a motive that all communication had been stopped between the\\ncorral and Granite House, and who but the convicts could have any\\ninterest in interrupting this communication?\\n\\nThe settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety. They were\\nsincerely attached to their new companion. Were they to find him struck\\ndown by the hands of those of whom he was formerly the leader?\\n\\nSoon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side of the\\nlittle stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered the meadows\\nof the corral. They then moderated their pace so that they should not\\nbe out of breath at the moment when a struggle might be necessary. Their\\nguns were in their hands ready cocked. The forest was watched on every\\nside. Top uttered sullen groans which were rather ominous.\\n\\nAt last the palisade appeared through the trees. No trace of any damage\\ncould be seen. The gate was shut as usual. Deep silence reigned in the\\ncorral. Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor Ayrton’s voice\\ncould be heard.\\n\\n“Let us enter,” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nAnd the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch about\\ntwenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment’s notice.\\n\\nHarding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push it\\nback, when Top barked loudly. A report sounded and was responded to by a\\ncry of pain.\\n\\nHerbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\n\\nAt Herbert’s cry, Pencroft, letting his gun fall, rushed towards him.\\n\\n“They have killed him!” he cried. “My boy! They have killed him!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ran to Herbert.\\n\\nThe reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad’s heart was still\\nbeating.\\n\\n“He lives,” said he, “but he must be carried--”\\n\\n“To Granite House? that is impossible!” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“Into the corral, then!” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“In a moment,” said Harding.\\n\\nAnd he ran round the left corner of the palisade. There he found a\\nconvict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. In a few\\nseconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he fell,\\nstruck to the heart by Harding’s dagger, more sure even than his gun.\\n\\nDuring this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over\\nthe palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down the props which\\nsupported the inner door, ran into the empty house, and soon, poor\\nHerbert was lying on Ayrton’s bed. In a few moments, Harding was by his\\nside.\\n\\nOn seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor’s grief was terrible.\\n\\nHe sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the wall.\\n\\nNeither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They themselves\\nwere choked with emotion. They could not speak.\\n\\nHowever, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death the\\npoor boy who was suffering beneath their eyes. Gideon Spilett had not\\npassed through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered\\nwithout acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine. He knew a little\\nof everything, and several times he had been obliged to attend to wounds\\nproduced either by a sword-bayonet or shot. Assisted by Cyrus Harding,\\nhe proceeded to render the aid Herbert required.\\n\\nThe reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in which\\nHerbert lay, a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to the shock,\\nthe ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to produce a violent\\nconcussion.\\n\\nHerbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett only felt\\nit beat at long intervals, as if it was on the point of stopping.\\n\\nThese symptoms were very serious.\\n\\nHerbert’s chest was laid bare, and the blood having been stanched with\\nhandkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water.\\n\\nThe contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,--an oval below the\\nchest between the third and fourth ribs. It was there that Herbert had\\nbeen hit by the bullet.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over; as they\\ndid so, he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his\\nlast sigh.\\n\\nHerberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound, by\\nwhich the ball had immediately escaped.\\n\\n“God be praised!” said the reporter, “the ball is not in the body, and\\nwe shall not have to extract it.”\\n\\n“But the heart?” asked Harding.\\n\\n“The heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would be dead!”\\n\\n“Dead!” exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan.\\n\\nThe sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter.\\n\\n“No, Pencroft,” replied Cyrus Harding, “no! He is not dead. His pulse\\nstill beats. He has even uttered a moan. But for your boy’s sake, calm\\nyourself. We have need of all our self-possession.”\\n\\n“Do not make us lose it, my friend.”\\n\\nPencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears rolled down\\nhis cheeks.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his ideas, and\\nproceed methodically. After his examination he had no doubt that the\\nball, entering in front, between the seventh and eighth ribs, had issued\\nbehind between the third and fourth. But what mischief had the ball\\ncommitted in its passage? What important organs had been reached? A\\nprofessional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at\\nonce, and still more so the reporter.\\n\\nHowever, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to prevent the\\ninflammatory strangulation of the injured parts, then to contend with\\nthe local inflammation and fever which would result from the wound,\\nperhaps mortal! Now, what styptics, what antiphlogistics ought to be\\nemployed? By what means could inflammation be prevented?\\n\\nAt any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds should\\nbe dressed without delay. It did not appear necessary to Gideon Spilett\\nthat a fresh flow of blood should be caused by bathing them in tepid\\nwater, and compressing their lips. The hemorrhage had been very\\nabundant, and Herbert was already too much enfeebled by the loss of\\nblood.\\n\\nThe reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds\\nwith cold water.\\n\\nHerbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that\\nposition.\\n\\n“He must not be moved.” said Gideon Spilett. “He is in the most\\nfavorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to suppurate\\neasily, and absolute rest is necessary.”\\n\\n“What! can’t we carry him to Granite House?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“No, Pencroft,” replied the reporter.\\n\\n“I’ll pay the villains off!” cried the sailor, shaking his fist in a\\nmenacing manner.\\n\\n“Pencroft!” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nGideon Spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy. Herbert\\nwas still so frightfully pale, that the reporter felt anxious.\\n\\n“Cyrus,” said he, “I am not a surgeon. I am in terrible perplexity. You\\nmust aid me with your advice, your experience!”\\n\\n“Take courage, my friend,” answered the engineer, pressing the\\nreporter’s hand. “Judge coolly. Think only of this: Herbert must be\\nsaved!”\\n\\nThese words restored to Gideon Spilett that self-possession which he had\\nlost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility.\\nHe seated himself close to the bed. Cyrus Harding stood near. Pencroft\\nhad torn up his shirt, and was mechanically making lint.\\n\\nSpilett then explained to Cyrus Harding that he thought he ought first\\nof all to stop the hemorrhage, but not close the two wounds, or cause\\ntheir immediate cicatrization, for there had been internal perforation,\\nand the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest.\\n\\nHarding approved entirely, and it was decided that the two wounds should\\nbe dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation.\\n\\nAnd now did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against\\nthe inflammation which might occur?\\n\\nYes. They had one, for nature had generously lavished it. They had cold\\nwater, that is to say, the most powerful sedative that can be employed\\nagainst inflammation of wounds, the most efficacious therapeutic agent\\nin grave cases, and the one which is now adopted by all physicians.\\nCold water has, moreover, the advantage of leaving the wound in absolute\\nrest, and preserving it from all premature dressing, a considerable\\nadvantage, since it has been found by experience that contact with the\\nair is dangerous during the first days.\\n\\nGideon Spilett and Cyrus Harding reasoned thus with their simple good\\nsense, and they acted as the best surgeon would have done. Compresses\\nof linen were applied to poor Herbert’s two wounds, and were kept\\nconstantly wet with cold water.\\n\\nThe sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut, which was not wanting\\nin things necessary for life. Maple sugar, medicinal plants, the same\\nwhich the lad had gathered on the banks of Lake Grant, enabled them to\\nmake some refreshing drinks, which they gave him without his taking any\\nnotice of it. His fever was extremely high, and all that day and night\\npassed without his becoming conscious.\\n\\nHerbert’s life hung on a thread, and this thread might break at any\\nmoment. The next day, the 12th of November, the hopes of Harding and his\\ncompanions slightly revived. Herbert had come out of his long stupor.\\nHe opened his eyes, he recognized Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and\\nPencroft. He uttered two or three words. He did not know what had\\nhappened. They told him, and Spilett begged him to remain perfectly\\nstill, telling him that his life was not in danger, and that his wounds\\nwould heal in a few days. However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all,\\nand the cold water with which they were constantly bathed, prevented any\\ninflammation of the wounds. The suppuration was established in a regular\\nway, the fever did not increase, and it might now be hoped that this\\nterrible wound would not involve any catastrophe. Pencroft felt the\\nswelling of his heart gradually subside. He was like a sister of mercy,\\nlike a mother by the bed of her child.\\n\\nHerbert dozed again, but his sleep appeared more natural.\\n\\n“Tell me again that you hope, Mr. Spilett,” said Pencroft. “Tell me\\nagain that you will save Herbert!”\\n\\n“Yes, we will save him!” replied the reporter. “The wound is serious,\\nand, perhaps, even the ball has traversed the lungs, but the perforation\\nof this organ is not fatal.”\\n\\n“God bless you!” answered Pencroft.\\n\\nAs may be believed, during the four-and-twenty hours they had been in\\nthe corral, the colonists had no other thought than that of nursing\\nHerbert. They did not think either of the danger which threatened them\\nshould the convicts return, or of the precautions to be taken for the\\nfuture.\\n\\nBut on this day, while Pencroft watched by the sick-bed, Cyrus Harding\\nand the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do.\\n\\nFirst of all they examined the corral. There was not a trace of Ayrton.\\nHad the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices? Had he\\nresisted, and been overcome in the struggle? This last supposition was\\nonly too probable. Gideon Spilett, at the moment he scaled the palisade,\\nhad clearly seen some one of the convicts running along the southern\\nspur of Mount Franklin, towards whom Top had sprung. It was one of those\\nwhose object had been so completely defeated by the rocks at the mouth\\nof the Mercy. Besides, the one killed by Harding, and whose body was\\nfound outside the enclosure, of course belonged to Bob Harvey’s crew.\\n\\nAs to the corral, it had not suffered any damage. The gates were closed,\\nand the animals had not been able to disperse in the forest. Nor could\\nthey see traces of any struggle, any devastation, either in the hut,\\nor in the palisade. The ammunition only, with which Ayrton had been\\nsupplied, had disappeared with him.\\n\\n“The unhappy man has been surprised,” said Harding, “and as he was a man\\nto defend himself, he must have been overpowered.”\\n\\n“Yes, that is to be feared!” said the reporter. “Then, doubtless, the\\nconvicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of\\neverything, and only fled when they saw us coming. It is very evident,\\ntoo, that at this moment Ayrton, whether living or dead, is not here!”\\n\\n“We shall have to beat the forest,” said the engineer, “and rid the\\nisland of these wretches. Pencroft’s presentiments were not mistaken,\\nwhen he wished to hunt them as wild beasts. That would have spared us\\nall these misfortunes!”\\n\\n“Yes,” answered the reporter, “but now we have the right to be\\nmerciless!”\\n\\n“At any rate,” said the engineer, “we are obliged to wait some time,\\nand to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert without danger to\\nGranite House.”\\n\\n“But Neb?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“Neb is in safety.”\\n\\n“But if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?”\\n\\n“He must not come!” returned Cyrus Harding quickly. “He would be\\nmurdered on the road!”\\n\\n“It is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin us!”\\n\\n“Ah, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned! But that is\\nimpossible now! As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone, we could\\nnot do it! Well, I will go alone to Granite House.”\\n\\n“No, no! Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “you must not expose yourself!\\nYour courage would be of no avail. The villains are evidently watching\\nthe corral, they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it, and if\\nyou go we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one!”\\n\\n“But Neb?” repeated the engineer. “It is now four-and-twenty hours since\\nhe has had any news of us! He will be sure to come!”\\n\\n“And as he will be less on his guard than we should be ourselves,” added\\nSpilett, “he will be killed!”\\n\\n“Is there really no way of warning him?”\\n\\nWhile the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going backwards\\nand forwards seemed to say,--\\n\\n“Am not I here?”\\n\\n“Top!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nThe animal sprang at his master’s call.\\n\\n“Yes, Top will go,” said the reporter, who had understood the engineer.\\n\\n“Top can go where we cannot! He will carry to Granite House the news of\\nthe corral, and he will bring back to us that from Granite House!”\\n\\n“Quick!” said Harding. “Quick!”\\n\\nSpilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note-book, and wrote these words:--\\n\\n“Herbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave\\nGranite House. Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood? Reply by\\nTop.”\\n\\nThis laconic note contained all that Neb ought to know, and at the same\\ntime asked all that the colonists wished to know. It was folded and\\nfastened to Top’s collar in a conspicuous position.\\n\\n“Top, my dog,” said the engineer, caressing the animal, “Neb, Top! Neb!\\nGo, go!”\\n\\nTop bounded at these words. He understood, he knew what was expected of\\nhim. The road to the corral was familiar to him. In less than an hour he\\ncould clear it, and it might be hoped that where neither Cyrus Harding\\nnor the reporter could have ventured without danger, Top, running among\\nthe grass or in the wood, would pass unperceived.\\n\\nThe engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it.\\n\\n“Neb, Top! Neb!” repeated the engineer, again pointing in the direction\\nof Granite House.\\n\\nTop sprang forwards, then almost immediately disappeared.\\n\\n“He will get there!” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Yes, and he will come back, the faithful animal!”\\n\\n“What o’clock is it?” asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Ten.”\\n\\n“In an hour he may be here. We will watch for his return.”\\n\\nThe gate of the corral was closed. The engineer and the reporter\\nre-entered the house. Herbert was still in a sleep. Pencroft kept the\\ncompresses always wet. Spilett, seeing there was nothing he could do\\nat that moment, busied himself in preparing some nourishment, while\\nattentively watching that part of the enclosure against the hill, at\\nwhich an attack might be expected.\\n\\nThe settlers awaited Top’s return with much anxiety. A little before\\neleven o’clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in hand, were\\nbehind the gate, ready to open it at the first bark of their dog.\\n\\nThey did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite House, Neb\\nwould have sent him back immediately.\\n\\nThey had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report was heard,\\nfollowed by repeated barks.\\n\\nThe engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the\\nwood, he fired in that direction.\\n\\nAlmost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was quickly\\nshut.\\n\\n“Top, Top!” exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog’s great honest head\\nbetween his hands.\\n\\nA note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these words,\\ntraced in Neb’s large writing:--“No pirates in the neighborhood of\\nGranite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr. Herbert!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\nSo the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and determined to\\nkill the settlers one after the other. There was nothing to be done but\\nto treat them as wild beasts. But great precautions must be taken, for\\njust now the wretches had the advantage on their side, seeing, and not\\nbeing seen, being able to surprise by the suddenness of their attack,\\nyet not to be surprised themselves. Harding made arrangements,\\ntherefore, for living in the corral, of which the provisions would last\\nfor a tolerable length of time. Ayrton’s house had been provided with\\nall that was necessary for existence, and the convicts, scared by\\nthe arrival of the settlers, had not had time to pillage it. It was\\nprobable, as Gideon Spilett observed, that things had occurred as\\nfollows:\\n\\nThe six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the southern\\nshore, and after having traversed the double shore of the Serpentine\\nPeninsula, not being inclined to venture into the Far West woods, they\\nhad reached the mouth of Falls River. From this point, by following the\\nright bank of the watercourse, they would arrive at the spurs of Mount\\nFranklin, among which they would naturally seek a retreat, and they\\ncould not have been long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited.\\nThere they had regularly installed themselves, awaiting the moment\\nto put their abominable schemes into execution. Ayrton’s arrival had\\nsurprised them, but they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man,\\nand--the rest may be easily imagined!\\n\\nNow, the convicts,--reduced to five, it is true, but well armed,--were\\nroaming the woods, and to venture there was to expose themselves to\\ntheir attacks, which could be neither guarded against nor prevented.\\n\\n“Wait! There is nothing else to be done!” repeated Cyrus Harding. “When\\nHerbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and\\nhave satisfaction of these convicts. That will be the object of our\\ngrand expedition at the same time--”\\n\\n“As the search for our mysterious protector,” added Gideon Spilett,\\nfinishing the engineer’s sentence. “And it must be acknowledged, my dear\\nCyrus, that this time his protection was wanting at the very moment when\\nit was most necessary to us!”\\n\\n“Who knows?” replied the engineer.\\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“That we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett,\\nand that his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of\\nexercising itself. But that is not the question now. Herbert’s life\\nbefore everything.”\\n\\nThis was the colonists’ saddest thought. Several days passed, and the\\npoor boy’s state was happily no worse. Cold water, always kept at a\\nsuitable temperature, had completely prevented the inflammation of the\\nwounds. It even seemed to the reporter that this water, being slightly\\nsulphurous,--which was explained by the neighborhood of the volcano,\\nhad a more direct action on the healing. The suppuration was much\\nless abundant, and thanks to the incessant care by which he was\\nsurrounded!--Herbert returned to life, and his fever abated. He was\\nbesides subjected to a severe diet, and consequently his weakness was\\nand would be extreme; but there was no want of refreshing drinks, and\\nabsolute rest was of the greatest benefit to him. Cyrus Harding, Gideon\\nSpilett, and Pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the lad’s\\nwounds. All the linen in the house had been sacrificed. Herbert’s\\nwounds, covered with compresses and lint, were pressed neither too much\\nnor too little, so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting any\\ninflammatory reaction. The reporter used extreme care in the dressing,\\nknowing well the importance of it, and repeating to his companions that\\nwhich most surgeons willingly admit, that it is perhaps rarer to see a\\ndressing well done than an operation well performed.\\n\\nIn ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably better.\\nHe had begun to take some nourishment.\\n\\nThe color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes smiled at\\nhis nurses. He talked a little, notwithstanding Pencroft’s efforts, who\\ntalked incessantly to prevent him from beginning to speak, and told him\\nthe most improbable stories. Herbert had questioned him on the subject\\nof Ayrton, whom he was astonished not to see near him, thinking that\\nhe was at the corral. But the sailor, not wishing to distress Herbert,\\ncontented himself by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb, so as to\\ndefend Granite House.\\n\\n“Humph!” said Pencroft, “these pirates! they are gentlemen who have\\nno right to any consideration! And the captain wanted to win them by\\nkindness! I’ll send them some kindness, but in the shape of a good\\nbullet!”\\n\\n“And have they not been seen again?” asked Herbert.\\n\\n“No, my boy,” answered the sailor, “but we shall find them, and when\\nyou are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from behind will\\ndare to meet us face to face!”\\n\\n“I am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!”\\n\\n“Well! your strength will return gradually! What’s a ball through the\\nchest? Nothing but a joke! I’ve seen many, and I don’t think much of\\nthem!”\\n\\nAt last things appeared to be going on well, and if no complication\\noccurred, Herbert’s recovery might be regarded as certain. But what\\nwould have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been\\naggravated,--if, for example, the ball had remained in his body, if his\\narm or his leg had had to be amputated?\\n\\n“No,” said Spilett more than once, “I have never thought of such a\\ncontingency without shuddering!”\\n\\n“And yet, if it had been necessary to operate,” said Harding one day to\\nhim, “you would not have hesitated?”\\n\\n“No, Cyrus!” said Gideon Spilett, “but thank God that we have been\\nspared this complication!”\\n\\nAs in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to the logic\\nof that simple good sense of which they had made use so often, and once\\nmore, thanks to their general knowledge, it had succeeded! But might not\\na time come when all their science would be at fault? They were alone\\non the island. Now, men in all states of society are necessary to each\\nother. Cyrus Harding knew this well, and sometimes he asked if some\\ncircumstance might not occur which they would be powerless to surmount.\\nIt appeared to him besides, that he and his companions, till then so\\nfortunate, had entered into an unlucky period. During the two years and\\na half which had elapsed since their escape from Richmond, it might\\nbe said that they had had everything their own way. The island had\\nabundantly supplied them with minerals, vegetables, animals, and as\\nNature had constantly loaded them, their science had known how to take\\nadvantage of what she offered them.\\n\\nThe wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete. Moreover, in certain\\noccurrences an inexplicable influence had come to their aid!... But all\\nthat could only be for a time.\\n\\nIn short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against them.\\n\\nIn fact, the convicts’ ship had appeared in the waters of the island,\\nand if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six of\\nthem, at least, had escaped the catastrophe. They had disembarked on the\\nisland, and it was almost impossible to get at the five who survived.\\nAyrton had no doubt been murdered by these wretches, who possessed\\nfirearms, and at the first use that they had made of them, Herbert had\\nfallen, wounded almost mortally. Were these the first blows aimed by\\nadverse fortune at the colonists? This was often asked by Harding. This\\nwas often repeated by the reporter; and it appeared to him also that the\\nintervention, so strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served\\nthem so well, had now failed them. Had this mysterious being, whatever\\nhe was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island? Had\\nhe in his turn succumbed?\\n\\nNo reply was possible to these questions. But it must not be imagined\\nthat because Harding and his companions spoke of these things, they were\\nmen to despair. Far from that. They looked their situation in the face,\\nthey analyzed the chances, they prepared themselves for any event, they\\nstood firm and straight before the future, and if adversity was at last\\nto strike them, it would find in them men prepared to struggle against\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\nThe convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing. One\\nthing only was now to be desired, that his state would allow him to be\\nbrought to Granite House. However well built and supplied the corral\\nhouse was, it could not be so comfortable as the healthy granite\\ndwelling. Besides, it did not offer the same security, and its tenants,\\nnotwithstanding their watchfulness, were here always in fear of some\\nshot from the convicts. There, on the contrary, in the middle of that\\nimpregnable and inaccessible cliff, they would have nothing to fear, and\\nany attack on their persons would certainly fail. They therefore waited\\nimpatiently for the moment when Herbert might be moved without danger\\nfrom his wound, and they were determined to make this move, although the\\ncommunication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.\\n\\nThey had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account. The\\ncourageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite House, would\\nnot allow himself to be surprised. Top had not been sent again to him,\\nas it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which\\nmight deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary.\\n\\nThey waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be reunited at\\nGranite House. It pained the engineer to see his forces divided, for it\\ngave great advantage to the pirates. Since Ayrton’s disappearance they\\nwere only four against five, for Herbert could not yet be counted, and\\nthis was not the least care of the brave boy, who well understood the\\ntrouble of which he was the cause.\\n\\nThe question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to act\\nagainst the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of November\\nby Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a moment when Herbert\\nwas asleep and could not hear them.\\n\\n“My friends,” said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb and of the\\nimpossibility of communicating with him, “I think,--like you, that to\\nventure on the road to the corral would be to risk receiving a gunshot\\nwithout being able to return it. But do you not think that the best\\nthing to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?”\\n\\n“That is just what I was thinking,” answered Pencroft. “I believe we’re\\nnot fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding\\napproves, I’m ready to dash into the forest! Why, hang it, one man is\\nequal to another!”\\n\\n“But is he equal to five?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“I will join Pencroft,” said the reporter, “and both of us, well-armed\\nand accompanied by Top--”\\n\\n“My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft,” answered Harding, “let us reason\\ncoolly. If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island, if we knew\\nthat spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would undertake a direct\\nattack; but is there not occasion to fear, on the contrary, that they\\nare sure to fire the first shot?”\\n\\n“Well, captain,” cried Pencroft, “a bullet does not always reach its\\nmark.”\\n\\n“That which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft,” replied the\\nengineer. “Besides, observe that if both of you left the corral I should\\nremain here alone to defend it. Do you imagine that the convicts will\\nnot see you leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest,\\nand that they will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there\\nis no one here but a wounded boy and a man?”\\n\\n“You are right, captain,” replied Pencroft, his chest swelling with\\nsullen anger. “You are right; they will do all they can to retake the\\ncorral, which they know to be well stored; and alone you could not hold\\nit against them.”\\n\\n“Oh, if we were only at Granite House!”\\n\\n“If we were at Granite House,” answered the engineer, “the case would be\\nvery different. There I should not be afraid to leave Herbert with one,\\nwhile the other three went to search the forests of the island. But we\\nare at the corral, and it is best to stay here until we can leave it\\ntogether.”\\n\\nCyrus Harding’s reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions\\nunderstood it well.\\n\\n“If only Ayrton was still one of us!” said Gideon Spilett. “Poor fellow!\\nhis return to social life will have been but of short duration.”\\n\\n“If he is dead,” added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone.\\n\\n“Do you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared him?” asked\\nGideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Yes, if they had any interest in doing so.”\\n\\n“What! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions, forgetting\\nall that he owes us--”\\n\\n“Who knows?” answered the sailor, who did not hazard this shameful\\nsupposition without hesitating.\\n\\n“Pencroft,” said Harding, taking the sailor’s arm, “that is a wicked\\nidea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking\\nthus. I will answer for Ayrton’s fidelity.”\\n\\n“And I also,” added the reporter quickly.\\n\\n“Yes, yes, captain, I was wrong,” replied Pencroft; “it was a wicked\\nidea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it. But what can I do? I’m\\nnot in my senses. This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly,\\nand I have never felt so excited as I do now.\\n\\n“Be patient, Pencroft,” replied the engineer. “How long will it be, my\\ndear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to Granite House?”\\n\\n“That is difficult to say, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “for any\\nimprudence might involve terrible consequences. But his convalescence\\nis progressing, and if he continues to gain strength, in eight days from\\nnow--well, we shall see.”\\n\\nEight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until the\\nfirst days of December. At this time two months of spring had already\\npassed. The weather was fine, and the heat began to be great. The\\nforests of the island were in full leaf, and the time was approaching\\nwhen the usual crops ought to be gathered. The return to the plateau of\\nProspect Heights would, therefore, be followed by extensive agricultural\\nlabors, interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island.\\n\\nIt can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this seclusion in\\nthe corral must have been to the colonists.\\n\\nBut if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not do so\\nwithout impatience.\\n\\nOnce or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made the\\ntour of the palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun\\ncocked, was ready for any emergency.\\n\\nHe met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His dog\\nwould have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might\\nbe concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment at least, and\\nthat the convicts were occupied in another part of the island.\\n\\nHowever, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon Spilett,\\nwho had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods, towards the south\\nof the mountain, remarked that Top scented something. The dog had no\\nlonger his unconcerned manner; he went backwards and forwards, ferreting\\namong the grass and bushes as if his smell had revealed some suspicious\\nobject to him.\\n\\nGideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his voice,\\nwhile keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and sheltering\\nhimself behind the trees. It was not probable that Top scented the\\npresence of man, for in that case, he would have announced it by\\nhalf-uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now, as he did not growl, it was\\nbecause danger was neither near nor approaching.\\n\\nNearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter following\\nhim prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a thick bush,\\nand drew out a rag.\\n\\nIt was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett immediately\\nbrought back to the corral. There it was examined by the colonists,\\nwho found that it was a fragment of Ayrton’s waistcoat, a piece of that\\nfelt, manufactured solely by the Granite House factory.\\n\\n“You see, Pencroft,” observed Harding, “there has been resistance on the\\npart of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have dragged him away in\\nspite of himself! Do you still doubt his honesty?”\\n\\n“No, captain,” answered the sailor, “and I repented of my suspicion a\\nlong time ago! But it seems to me that something may be learned from the\\nincident.”\\n\\n“What is that?” asked the reporter.\\n\\n“It is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they dragged him\\naway living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps, he is still\\nliving!”\\n\\n“Perhaps, indeed,” replied the engineer, who remained thoughtful.\\n\\nThis was a hope, to which Ayrton’s companions could still hold. Indeed,\\nthey had before believed that, surprised in the corral, Ayrton had\\nfallen by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the convicts had not\\nkilled him at first, if they had brought him living to another part of\\nthe island, might it not be admitted that he was still their prisoner?\\nPerhaps, even, one of them had found in Ayrton his old Australian\\ncompanion Ben Joyce, the chief of the escaped convicts. And who knows\\nbut that they had conceived the impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton\\nto themselves? He would have been very useful to them, if they had been\\nable to make him turn traitor!\\n\\nThis incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the corral, and\\nit no longer appeared impossible that they should find Ayrton again.\\nOn his side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would no doubt do all\\nhe could to escape from the hands of the villains, and this would be a\\npowerful aid to the settlers!\\n\\n“At any rate,” observed Gideon Spilett, “if happily Ayrton did manage to\\nescape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he could not know\\nof the attempted assassination of which Herbert has been a victim, and\\nconsequently would never think of our being imprisoned in the corral.”\\n\\n“Oh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!” cried Pencroft, “and\\nthat we were there, too! For, although the rascals can do nothing to our\\nhouse, they may plunder the plateau, our plantations, our poultry-yard!”\\n\\nPencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his crops.\\nBut it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any to return\\nto Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of the settlers\\nwas needed there. And it was he who was keeping them at the corral!\\nTherefore, one idea occupied his mind--to leave the corral, and when!\\nHe believed he could bear removal to Granite House. He was sure his\\nstrength would return more quickly in his room, with the air and sight\\nof the sea!\\n\\nSeveral times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with\\ngood reason, that Herbert’s wounds, half healed, might reopen on the\\nway, did not give the order to start.\\n\\nHowever, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and his\\ntwo friends to yield to the lad’s wish, and God alone knew that this\\ndetermination might cause them grief and remorse.\\n\\nIt was the 29th of November, seven o’clock in the evening. The three\\nsettlers were talking in Herbert’s room, when they heard Top utter quick\\nbarks.\\n\\nHarding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the\\nhouse. Top, at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking, but it\\nwas with pleasure, not anger.\\n\\n“Some one is coming.”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“It is not an enemy!”\\n\\n“Neb, perhaps?”\\n\\n“Or Ayrton?”\\n\\nThese words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two\\ncompanions when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on the ground\\ninside the corral.\\n\\nIt was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a most\\ncordial reception.\\n\\n“Jup!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\n\\n“Neb has sent him to us,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Then,” replied the engineer, “he must have some note on him.”\\n\\nPencroft rushed up to the orang. Certainly if Neb had any important\\nmatter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or\\nmore rapid messenger, who could pass where neither the colonists could,\\nnor even Top himself.\\n\\nCyrus Harding was not mistaken. At Jup’s neck hung a small bag, and in\\nthis bag was found a little note traced by Neb’s hand.\\n\\nThe despair of Harding and his companions may be imagined when they read\\nthese words:--\\n\\n\\n“Friday, six o’clock in the morning.\\n\\n“Plateau invaded by convicts.\\n\\n                             “Neb.”\\n\\n\\nThey gazed at each other without uttering a word, then they re-entered\\nthe house. What were they to do? The convicts on Prospect Heights! that\\nwas disaster, devastation, ruin.\\n\\nHerbert, on seeing the engineer, the reporter, and Pencroft re-enter,\\nguessed that their situation was aggravated, and when he saw Jup, he no\\nlonger doubted that some misfortune menaced Granite House.\\n\\n“Captain Harding,” said he, “I must go; I can bear the journey. I must\\ngo.”\\n\\nGideon Spilett approached Herbert; then, having looked at him,--\\n\\n“Let us go, then!” said he.\\n\\nThe question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be carried on a\\nlitter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the corral. The motion\\nof the litter would have been more easy for the wounded lad, but it\\nwould have necessitated two bearers, that is to say, there would have\\nbeen two guns less for defense if an attack was made on the road. Would\\nthey not, on the contrary, by employing the cart leave every arm free?\\nWas it impossible to place the mattress on which Herbert was lying in\\nit, and to advance with so much care that any jolt should be avoided? It\\ncould be done.\\n\\nThe cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus Harding and\\nthe reporter raised Herbert’s mattress and placed it on the bottom of\\nthe cart. The weather was fine. The sun’s bright rays glanced through\\nthe trees.\\n\\n“Are the guns ready?” asked Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nThey were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a double-barreled\\ngun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had nothing to do but start.\\n\\n“Are you comfortable, Herbert?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“Ah, captain,” replied the lad, “don’t be uneasy, I shall not die on the\\nroad!”\\n\\nWhile speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had called up\\nall his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had collected his\\nfailing strength.\\n\\nThe engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated to\\ngive the signal for departure; but that would have driven Herbert to\\ndespair--killed him perhaps.\\n\\n“Forward!” said Harding.\\n\\nThe gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to be\\nsilent, ran in advance. The cart came out, the gate was reclosed, and\\nthe onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow pace.\\n\\nCertainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different road than\\nthat which led straight from the corral to Granite House, but the cart\\nwould have met with great difficulties in moving under the trees. It was\\nnecessary, therefore, to follow this way, although it was well known to\\nthe convicts.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the cart,\\nready to answer to any attack. However, it was not probable that the\\nconvicts would have yet left the plateau of Prospect Heights.\\n\\nNeb’s note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts\\nhad shown themselves there. Now, this note was dated six o’clock in\\nthe morning, and the active orang, accustomed to come frequently to the\\ncorral, had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five\\nmiles which separated it from Granite House. They would, therefore, be\\nsafe at that time, and if there was any occasion for firing, it would\\nprobably not be until they were in the neighborhood of Granite House.\\nHowever, the colonists kept a strict watch. Top and Jup, the latter\\narmed with his club, sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at\\nthe sides of the road, signalized no danger.\\n\\nThe cart advanced slowly under Pencroft’s guidance. It had left the\\ncorral at half-past seven. An hour after, four out of the five miles\\nhad been cleared, without any incident having occurred. The road was\\nas deserted as all that part of the Jacamar Wood which lay between the\\nMercy and the lake. There was no occasion for any warning. The wood\\nappeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on\\nthe island.\\n\\nThey approached the plateau. Another mile and they would see the bridge\\nover Creek Glycerine. Cyrus Harding expected to find it in its place;\\nsupposing that the convicts would have crossed it, and that, after\\nhaving passed one of the streams which enclosed the plateau, they\\nwould have taken the precaution to lower it again, so as to keep open a\\nretreat.\\n\\nAt length an opening in the trees allowed the sea-horizon to be seen.\\nBut the cart continued its progress, for not one of its defenders\\nthought of abandoning it.\\n\\nAt that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse voice,--\\n\\n“Oh! the villains!” he exclaimed.\\n\\nAnd he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds, and the\\nbuildings at the poultry-yard.\\n\\nA man was moving about in the midst of the smoke. It was Neb.\\n\\nHis companions uttered a shout. He heard, and ran to meet them.\\n\\nThe convicts had left the plateau nearly half-an-hour before, having\\ndevastated it!\\n\\n“And Mr. Herbert?” asked Neb.\\n\\nGideon Spilett returned to the cart.\\n\\nHerbert had lost consciousness!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\nOf the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins\\nwith which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer.\\nHerbert’s critical state outweighed all other considerations. Would the\\nremoval prove fatal to him by causing some internal injury? The reporter\\ncould not affirm it, but he and his companions almost despaired of\\nthe result. The cart was brought to the bend of the river. There some\\nbranches, disposed as a liner, received the mattress on which lay the\\nunconscious Herbert. Ten minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and\\nPencroft were at the foot of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart\\non to the plateau of Prospect Heights. The lift was put in motion, and\\nHerbert was soon stretched on his bed in Granite House.\\n\\nWhat cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life! He smiled for\\na moment on finding himself in his room, but could scarcely even murmur\\na few words, so great was his weakness. Gideon Spilett examined his\\nwounds. He feared to find them reopened, having been imperfectly healed.\\nThere was nothing of the sort. From whence, then, came this prostration?\\nwhy was Herbert so much worse? The lad then fell into a kind of feverish\\nsleep, and the reporter and Pencroft remained near the bed. During this\\ntime, Harding told Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb\\nrecounted to his master the events of which the plateau had just been\\nthe theater.\\n\\nIt was only during the preceding night that the convicts had appeared on\\nthe edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek Glycerine. Neb, who\\nwas watching near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of\\nthe pirates, who was about to cross the stream; but in the darkness he\\ncould not tell whether the man had been hit or not. At any rate, it was\\nnot enough to frighten away the band, and Neb had only just time to get\\nup to Granite House, where at least he was in safety.\\n\\nBut what was he to do there? How prevent the devastations with which the\\nconvicts threatened the plateau? Had Neb any means by which to warn\\nhis master? And, besides, in what situation were the inhabitants of the\\ncorral themselves? Cyrus Harding and his companions had left on the 11th\\nof November, and it was now the 29th. It was, therefore, nineteen days\\nsince Neb had had other news than that brought by Top--disastrous news:\\nAyrton disappeared, Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter,\\nand sailor, as it were, imprisoned in the corral!\\n\\nWhat was he to do? asked poor Neb. Personally he had nothing to\\nfear, for the convicts could not reach him in Granite House. But the\\nbuildings, the plantations, all their arrangements at the mercy of the\\npirates! Would it not be best to let Cyrus Harding judge of what he\\nought to do, and to warn him, at least, of the danger which threatened\\nhim?\\n\\nNeb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him. He knew\\nthe orang’s great intelligence, which had been often put to the proof.\\nJup understood the word corral, which had been frequently pronounced\\nbefore him, and it may be remembered, too, that he had often driven\\nthe cart thither in company with Pencroft. Day had not yet dawned. The\\nactive orang would know how to pass unperceived through the woods, of\\nwhich the convicts, besides, would think he was a native.\\n\\nNeb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup’s neck, he\\nbrought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a\\nlong cord to the ground; then, several times he repeated these words,--\\n\\n“Jup Jup! corral, corral!”\\n\\nThe creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down the beach,\\nand disappeared in the darkness without the convicts’ attention having\\nbeen in the least excited.\\n\\n“You did well, Neb,” said Harding, “but perhaps in not warning us you\\nwould have done still better!”\\n\\nAnd, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose recovery\\nthe removal had so seriously checked.\\n\\nNeb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on the\\nbeach. Not knowing the number of the island’s inhabitants, they might\\nsuppose that Granite House was defended by a large party. They must have\\nremembered that during the attack by the brig numerous shot had been\\nfired both from the lower and upper rocks, and no doubt they did not\\nwish to expose themselves. But the plateau of Prospect Heights was\\nopen to them, and not covered by the fire of Granite House. They gave\\nthemselves up, therefore, to their instinct of destruction,--plundering,\\nburning, devastating everything,--and only retiring half an hour before\\nthe arrival of the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the\\ncorral.\\n\\nOn their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the risk\\nof being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire which was\\nconsuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had struggled, though\\nin vain, against it until the cart appeared at the edge of the wood.\\n\\nSuch had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts\\nconstituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln\\nIsland, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater\\nmisfortunes.\\n\\nSpilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft, while\\nCyrus Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for himself of the\\nextent of the disaster.\\n\\nIt was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot of\\nGranite House. The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case not\\nhave escaped destruction. But after all, this evil would have been more\\neasily reparable than the ruins accumulated on the plateau of Prospect\\nHeights. Harding and Neb proceeded towards the Mercy, and ascended its\\nleft bank without meeting with any trace of the convicts; nor on the\\nother side of the river, in the depths of the wood, could they perceive\\nany suspicious indications.\\n\\nBesides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the\\nconvicts knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by having\\nseen them pass on the road from the corral, or, after the devastation of\\nthe plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood, following the course\\nof the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their return.\\n\\nIn the former case, they must have returned towards the corral, now\\nwithout defenders, and which contained valuable stores.\\n\\nIn the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and would wait\\non opportunity to recommence the attack.\\n\\nIt was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise to clear\\nthe island was now rendered difficult by reason of Herbert’s condition.\\nIndeed, their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with\\nthe convicts, and just now no one could leave Granite House.\\n\\nThe engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned\\neverywhere. The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat, which\\nwere nearly full-grown, lay on the ground. The other plantations had not\\nsuffered less.\\n\\nThe kitchen-garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House possessed a\\nstore of seed which would enable them to repair these misfortunes.\\n\\nAs to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable,\\nthe fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures roamed over the\\nplateau. The birds, which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters\\nof the lake, had already returned to their accustomed spot, and were\\ndabbling on the banks. Everything would have to be reconstructed.\\n\\nCyrus Harding’s face, which was paler than usual, expressed an internal\\nanger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not utter a word.\\nOnce more he looked at his devastated fields, and at the smoke which\\nstill rose from the ruins, then he returned to Granite House.\\n\\nThe following days were the saddest of any that the colonists had passed\\non the island! Herbert’s weakness visibly increased. It appeared that\\na more serious malady, the consequence of the profound physiological\\ndisturbance he had gone through, threatened to declare itself, and\\nGideon Spilett feared such an aggravation of his condition that he would\\nbe powerless to fight against it!\\n\\nIn fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of drowsiness,\\nand symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves. Refreshing drinks\\nwere the only remedies at the colonists’ disposal. The fever was not\\nas yet very high, but it soon appeared that it would probably recur at\\nregular intervals. Gideon Spilett first recognized this on the 6th of\\nDecember.\\n\\nThe poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely\\npale, was at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations, and\\ntremblings. His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his thirst\\nintense. To this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became flushed; his\\nskin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse perspiration broke out\\nafter which the fever seemed to diminish. The attack had lasted nearly\\nfive hours.\\n\\nGideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too certain, was\\nnow seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever must be cured at any\\ncost before it should assume a more serious aspect.\\n\\n“And in order to cure it,” said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, “we need a\\nfebrifuge.”\\n\\n“A febrifuge--” answered the engineer. “We have neither Peruvian bark,\\nnor sulphate of quinine.”\\n\\n“No,” said Gideon Spilett, “but there are willows on the border of\\nthe lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be a\\nsubstitute for quinine.”\\n\\n“Let us try it without losing a moment,” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nThe bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a\\nsuccedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the horse-chestnut\\ntree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc. It was evidently\\nnecessary to make trial of this substance, although not so valuable as\\nPeruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural state, since they had no\\nmeans for extracting its essence.\\n\\nCyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black\\nwillow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite House, and\\nreduced them to a powder, which was administered that same evening to\\nHerbert.\\n\\nThe night passed without any important change. Herbert was somewhat\\ndelirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not\\nreturn either during the following day.\\n\\nPencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It might be\\nthat the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it would return\\nnext day. Therefore, he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety.\\n\\nIt might have been remarked besides that during this period Herbert\\nremained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy. Another symptom\\nalarmed the reporter to the highest degree. Herbert’s liver became\\ncongested, and soon a more intense delirium showed that his brain was\\nalso affected.\\n\\nGideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took the\\nengineer aside.\\n\\n“It is a malignant fever,” said he.\\n\\n“A malignant fever!” cried Harding. “You are mistaken, Spilett. A\\nmalignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ must\\npreviously have existed.”\\n\\n“I am not mistaken,” replied the reporter. “Herbert no doubt contracted\\nthe germ of this fever in the marshes of the island. He has already had\\none attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent\\na third, he is lost.”\\n\\n“But the willow bark?”\\n\\n“That is insufficient,” answered the reporter, “and the third attack of\\na malignant fever, which is not arrested by means of quinine, is always\\nfatal.”\\n\\nFortunately, Pencroft heard nothing of this conversation or he would\\nhave gone mad.\\n\\nIt may be imagined what anxiety the engineer and the reporter suffered\\nduring the day of the 7th of December and the following night.\\n\\nTowards the middle of the day the second attack came on. The crisis was\\nterrible. Herbert felt himself sinking. He stretched his arms towards\\nCyrus Harding, towards Spilett, towards Pencroft. He was so young to\\ndie! The scene was heart-rending. They were obliged to send Pencroft\\naway.\\n\\nThe fit lasted five hours. It was evident that Herbert could not survive\\na third.\\n\\nThe night was frightful. In his delirium Herbert uttered words which\\nwent to the hearts of his companions. He struggled with the convicts,\\nhe called to Ayrton, he poured forth entreaties to that mysterious\\nbeing,--that powerful unknown protector,--whose image was stamped upon\\nhis mind; then he again fell into a deep exhaustion which completely\\nprostrated him. Several times Gideon Spilett thought that the poor boy\\nwas dead.\\n\\nThe next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting\\nfits. Herbert’s thin hands clutched the sheets. They had administered\\nfurther doses of pounded bark, but the reporter expected no result from\\nit.\\n\\n“If before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic\\nfebrifuge,” said the reporter, “Herbert will be dead.”\\n\\nNight arrived--the last night, it was too much to be feared, of the\\ngood, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years, and who\\nwas loved by all as their own child. The only remedy which existed\\nagainst this terrible malignant fever, the only specific which could\\novercome it, was not to be found in Lincoln Island.\\n\\nDuring the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a more\\nviolent delirium. His liver was fearfully congested, his brain affected,\\nand already it was impossible for him to recognize any one.\\n\\nWould he live until the next day, until that third attack which\\nmust infallibly carry him off? It was not probable. His strength was\\nexhausted, and in the intervals of fever he lay as one dead.\\n\\nTowards three o’clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing cry.\\nHe seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion. Neb, who was near him,\\nterrified, ran into the next room where his companions were watching.\\n\\nTop, at that moment, barked in a strange manner.\\n\\nAll rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy, who was\\nendeavoring to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett, taking his\\narm, felt his pulse gradually quicken.\\n\\nIt was five in the morning. The rays of the rising sun began to shine in\\nat the windows of Granite House. It promised to be a fine day, and this\\nday was to be poor Herbert’s last!\\n\\nA ray glanced on the table placed near the bed.\\n\\nSuddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table.\\n\\nOn it lay a little oblong box, of which the cover bore these\\nwords:--“SULPHATE OF QUININE.”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\nGideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly two\\nhundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he carried to\\nhis lips. The extreme bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt;\\nit was certainly the precious extract of quinine, that pre-eminent\\nantifebrile.\\n\\nThis powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How it came\\nthere might be discussed later.\\n\\n“Some coffee!” said Spilett.\\n\\nIn a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon Spilett\\nthrew into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in\\nmaking Herbert drink the mixture.\\n\\nThere was still time, for the third attack of the malignant fever had\\nnot yet shown itself. How they longed to be able to add that it would\\nnot return!\\n\\nBesides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived. The\\nmysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical moment,\\nwhen they had despaired of it.\\n\\nIn a few hours Herbert was much calmer. The colonists could now discuss\\nthis incident. The intervention of the stranger was more evident than\\never. But how had he been able to penetrate during the night into\\nGranite House? It was inexplicable, and, in truth, the proceedings of\\nthe genius of the island were not less mysterious than was that genius\\nhimself. During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to\\nHerbert every three hours.\\n\\nThe next day some improvement in Herbert’s condition was apparent.\\nCertainly, he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers being subject\\nto frequent and dangerous relapses, but the most assiduous care was\\nbestowed on him. And besides, the specific was at hand; nor, doubtless,\\nwas he who had brought it far distant! And the hearts of all were\\nanimated by returning hope.\\n\\nThis hope was not disappointed. Ten days after, on the 20th of December,\\nHerbert’s convalescence commenced.\\n\\nHe was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him, but no\\naccess of fever supervened. And then, the poor boy submitted with such\\ndocility to all the prescriptions ordered him! He longed so to get well!\\n\\nPencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of an abyss.\\nFits of joy approaching delirium seized him. When the time for the third\\nattack had passed by, he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace.\\nSince then, he always called him Dr. Spilett.\\n\\nThe real doctor, however, remained undiscovered.\\n\\n“We will find him!” repeated the sailor.\\n\\nCertainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too\\nenergetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft!\\n\\nThe month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during which\\nthe colonists of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely tried.\\nThey commenced the year 1868 with magnificent weather, great heat, and\\na tropical temperature, delightfully cooled by the sea-breeze. Herbert’s\\nrecovery progressed, and from his bed, placed near one of the windows of\\nGranite House, he could inhale the fresh air, charged with ozone, which\\ncould not fail to restore his health. His appetite returned, and what\\nnumberless delicate, savory little dishes Neb prepared for him!\\n\\n“It is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!” said Pencroft.\\n\\nDuring all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity\\nof Granite House. There was no news of Ayrton, and though the engineer\\nand Herbert still had some hopes of finding him again, their companions\\ndid not doubt but that the unfortunate man had perished. However, this\\nuncertainty could not last, and when once the lad should have recovered,\\nthe expedition, the result of which must be so important, would be\\nundertaken. But they would have to wait a month, perhaps, for all\\nthe strength of the colony must be put into requisition to obtain\\nsatisfaction from the convicts.\\n\\nHowever, Herbert’s convalescence progressed rapidly. The congestion of\\nthe liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be considered completely\\nhealed.\\n\\nDuring the month of January, important work was done on the plateau\\nof Prospect Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as much as was\\npossible from the devastated crops, either of corn or vegetables. The\\ngrain and the plants were gathered, so as to provide a new harvest for\\nthe approaching half-season. With regard to rebuilding the poultry-yard,\\nwall, or stables, Cyrus Harding preferred to wait. While he and his\\ncompanions were in pursuit of the convicts, the latter might very\\nprobably pay another visit to the plateau, and it would be useless to\\ngive them an opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction. When\\nthe island should be cleared of these miscreants, they would set about\\nrebuilding. The young convalescent began to get up in the second week of\\nJanuary, at first for one hour a day, then two, then three. His strength\\nvisibly returned, so vigorous was his constitution. He was now eighteen\\nyears of age. He was tall, and promised to become a man of noble and\\ncommanding presence. From this time his recovery, while still requiring\\ncare,--and Dr. Spilett was very strict,--made rapid progress. Towards\\nthe end of the month, Herbert was already walking about on Prospect\\nHeights, and the beach.\\n\\nHe derived, from several sea-baths, which he took in company with\\nPencroft and Neb, the greatest possible benefit. Cyrus Harding thought\\nhe might now settle the day for their departure, for which the 15th of\\nFebruary was fixed. The nights, very clear at this time of year, would\\nbe favorable to the researches they intended to make all over the\\nisland.\\n\\nThe necessary preparations for this exploration were now commenced, and\\nwere important, for the colonists had sworn not to return to Granite\\nHouse until their twofold object had been achieved; on the one hand, to\\nexterminate the convicts, and rescue Ayrton, if he was still living; on\\nthe other, to discover who it was that presided so effectually over the\\nfortunes of the colony.\\n\\nOf Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern coast\\nfrom Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn Marsh, the\\nneighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the road to the corral\\nand the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and lastly, the\\nspurs of Mount Franklin, among which the corral had been established.\\n\\nThey had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore\\nof Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy\\nborder of the west coast, and the interminable downs, ending at the open\\nmouth of Shark Gulf. But they had in no way surveyed the woods which\\ncovered the Serpentine Peninsula, all to the right of the Mercy, the\\nleft bank of Falls River, and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which\\nsupported three quarters of the base of Mount Franklin, to the east, the\\nnorth, and the west, and where doubtless many secret retreats existed.\\nConsequently, many millions of acres of the island had still escaped\\ntheir investigations.\\n\\nIt was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried through\\nthe Far West, so as to include all that region situated on the right of\\nthe Mercy.\\n\\nIt might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the corral,\\nwhere it might be supposed that the convicts had again taken refuge,\\neither to pillage or to establish themselves there. But either the\\ndevastation of the corral would have been an accomplished fact by\\nthis time, and it would be too late to prevent it, or it had been the\\nconvicts’ interest to entrench themselves there, and there would be\\nstill time to go and turn them out on their return.\\n\\nTherefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to, and the\\nsettlers resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile End. They would\\nmake their way with their hatchets, and thus lay the first draft of a\\nroad which would place Granite House in communication with the end of\\nthe peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles.\\n\\nThe cart was in good condition. The onagers, well rested, could go a\\nlong journey. Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various\\nutensils were packed in the cart, as also weapons and ammunition,\\ncarefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of Granite House. But it\\nwas necessary to remember that the convicts were, perhaps, roaming about\\nthe woods, and that in the midst of these thick forests a shot might\\nquickly be fired and received. It was therefore resolved that the little\\nband of settlers should remain together and not separate under any\\npretext whatever.\\n\\nIt was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House. Top\\nand Jup themselves were to accompany the expedition; the inaccessible\\ndwelling needed no guard. The 14th of February, eve of the departure,\\nwas consecrated entirely to repose, and--thanksgiving addressed by the\\ncolonists to the Creator. A place in the cart was reserved for Herbert,\\nwho, though thoroughly convalescent, was still a little weak. The next\\nmorning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to\\nprotect Granite House from any invasion. The ladders, which were\\nformerly used for the ascent, were brought to the Chimneys and buried\\ndeep in the sand, so that they might be available on the return of the\\ncolonists, for the machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces, and\\nnothing of the apparatus remained. Pencroft stayed the last in Granite\\nHouse in order to finish this work, and he then lowered himself down\\nby means of a double rope held below, and which, when once hauled down,\\nleft no communication between the upper landing and the beach.\\n\\nThe weather was magnificent.\\n\\n“We shall have a warm day of it,” said the reporter, laughing.\\n\\n“Pooh! Dr. Spilett,” answered Pencroft, “we shall walk under the shade\\nof the trees and shan’t even see the sun!”\\n\\n“Forward!” said the engineer.\\n\\nThe cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys. The reporter\\nmade Herbert take his place in it during the first hours at least of the\\njourney, and the lad was obliged to submit to his doctor’s orders.\\n\\nNeb placed himself at the onagers’ heads. Cyrus Harding, the reporter,\\nand the sailor, walked in front. Top bounded joyfully along. Herbert\\noffered a seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted it without ceremony.\\nThe moment for departure had arrived, and the little band set out.\\n\\nThe cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then, having\\nascended the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at the other side\\nof which commenced the road to Port Balloon, and there the explorers,\\nleaving this road on their left, entered the cover of the immense woods\\nwhich formed the region of the Far West.\\n\\nFor the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the cart to\\npass with ease; from time to time it became necessary to cut away a few\\ncreepers and bushes, but no serious obstacle impeded the progress of the\\ncolonists.\\n\\nThe thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the ground.\\nDeodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum-trees, dragon-trees,\\nand other well-known species, succeeded each other far as the eye could\\nreach. The feathered tribes of the island were all represented--grouse,\\njacamars, pheasants, lories, as well as the chattering cockatoos,\\nparrots, and paroquets. Agouties, kangaroos, and capybaras fled swiftly\\nat their approach; and all this reminded the settlers of the first\\nexcursions they had made on their arrival at the island.\\n\\n“Nevertheless,” observed Cyrus Harding, “I notice that these creatures,\\nboth birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly. These woods\\nhave, therefore, been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall\\ncertainly find some traces of them.”\\n\\nAnd, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces, more or\\nless recent, of the passage of a band of men--here branches broken off\\nthe trees, perhaps to mark out the way; there the ashes of a fire, and\\nfootprints in clayey spots; but nothing which appeared to belong to a\\nsettled encampment.\\n\\nThe engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from hunting. The\\nreports of the firearms might give the alarm to the convicts, who\\nwere, perhaps, roaming through the forest. Moreover, the hunters would\\nnecessarily ramble some distance from the cart, which it was dangerous\\nto leave unguarded.\\n\\nIn the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite House,\\ntheir progress became much more difficult. In order to make their way\\nthrough some thickets, they were obliged to cut down trees. Before\\nentering such places Harding was careful to send in Top and Jup, who\\nfaithfully accomplished their commission, and when the dog and orang\\nreturned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to\\nfear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal\\nkingdom, whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level. On the\\nevening of the first day the colonists encamped about nine miles from\\nGranite House, on the border of a little stream falling into the Mercy,\\nand of the existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it\\nevidently, however, belonged to the hydiographical system to which the\\nsoil owed its astonishing fertility. The settlers made a hearty meal,\\nfor their appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken that\\nthe night might be passed in safety. If the engineer had had only to\\ndeal with wild beasts, jaguars or others, he would have simply lighted\\nfires all around his camp, which would have sufficed for its defense;\\nbut the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames,\\nand it was, therefore, better to be surrounded by the profound darkness\\nof night.\\n\\nThe watch was, however, carefully organized. Two of the settlers were\\nto watch together, and every two hours it was agreed that they should\\nbe relieved by their comrades. And so, notwithstanding his wish to the\\ncontrary, Herbert was exempted from guard. Pencroft and Gideon Spilett\\nin one party, the engineer and Neb in another, mounted guard in turns\\nover the camp.\\n\\nThe night, however, was but of few hours. The darkness was due rather to\\nthe thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun.\\nThe silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the\\nchattering of the monkeys, the latter appearing to particularly irritate\\nMaster Jup. The night passed without incident, and on the next day, the\\n15th of February, the journey through the forest, tedious rather than\\ndifficult, was continued. This day they could not accomplish more than\\nsix miles, for every moment they were obliged to cut a road with their\\nhatchets.\\n\\nLike true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful\\ntrees, which would besides have cost immense labor to fell, and the\\nsmall ones only were sacrificed, but the result was that the road took a\\nvery winding direction, and lengthened itself by numerous detours.\\n\\nDuring the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not before met\\nwith in the island, such as the tree-fern, with its leaves spread out\\nlike the waters of a fountain, locust-trees, on the long pods of\\nwhich the onagers browsed greedily, and which supplied a sweet pulp\\nof excellent flavor. There, too, the colonists again found groups of\\nmagnificent kauries, their cylindrical trunks, crowded with a cone\\nof verdure, rising to a height of two hundred feet. These were the\\ntree-kings of New Zealand, as celebrated as the cedars of Lebanon.\\n\\nAs to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already known to\\nthe hunters. Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get near them, a\\ncouple of those large birds peculiar to Australia, a sort of cassowary,\\ncalled emu, five feet in height, and with brown plumage, which belong\\nto the tribe of waders. Top darted after them as fast as his four legs\\ncould carry him, but the emus distanced him with ease, so prodigious was\\ntheir speed.\\n\\nAs to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were discovered. Some\\nfootprints found near an apparently recently extinguished fire were\\nattentively examined by the settlers. By measuring them one after the\\nother, according to their length and breadth, the marks of five men’s\\nfeet were easily distinguished. The five convicts had evidently\\ncamped on this spot; but,--and this was the object of so minute an\\nexamination,--a sixth footprint could not be discovered, which in that\\ncase would have been that of Ayrton.\\n\\n“Ayrton was not with them!” said Herbert.\\n\\n“No,” answered Pencroft, “and if he was not with them, it was because\\nthe wretches had already murdered him! but then these rascals have not a\\nden to which they may be tracked like tigers!”\\n\\n“No,” replied the reporter, “it is more probable that they wander at\\nrandom, and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they\\nwill be masters of the island!”\\n\\n“The masters of the island!” exclaimed the sailor; “the masters of the\\nisland!...” he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his throat was\\nseized in an iron grasp. Then in a calmer tone, “Do you know, Captain\\nHarding,” said he, “what the ball is which I have rammed into my gun?”\\n\\n“No, Pencroft!”\\n\\n“It is the ball that went through Herbert’s chest, and I promise you it\\nwon’t miss its mark!”\\n\\nBut this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life, and from\\nthe examination of the footprints left in the ground, they must, alas!\\nconclude that all hopes of ever seeing him again must be abandoned.\\n\\nThat evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House, and Cyrus\\nHarding calculated that they could not be more than five miles from\\nReptile Point.\\n\\nAnd indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached, and\\nthe whole length of the forest had been traversed; but there was nothing\\nto indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge, nor\\nthat, no less secret, which sheltered the mysterious unknown.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\nThe next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the exploration\\nof all that wooded region forming the shore from Reptile End to Falls\\nRiver. The colonists were able to search this forest thoroughly, for, as\\nit was comprised between the two shores of the Serpentine Peninsula, it\\nwas only from three to four miles in breadth. The trees, both by their\\nheight and their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of\\nthe soil, more astonishing here than in any other part of the island.\\nOne might have said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or\\nAfrica had been transported into this temperate zone. This led them to\\nconclude that the superb vegetation found a heat in this soil, damp in\\nits upper layer, but warmed in the interior by volcanic fires, which\\ncould not belong to a temperate climate. The most frequently occurring\\ntrees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic dimensions.\\n\\nBut the colonists’ object was not simply to admire the magnificent\\nvegetation. They knew already that in this respect Lincoln Island would\\nhave been worthy to take the first rank in the Canary group, to which\\nthe first name given was that of the Happy Isles. Now, alas! their\\nisland no longer belonged to them entirely; others had taken possession\\nof it, miscreants polluted its shores, and they must be destroyed to the\\nlast man.\\n\\nNo traces were found on the western coast, although they were carefully\\nsought for. No more footprints, no more broken branches, no more\\ndeserted camps.\\n\\n“This does not surprise me,” said Cyrus Harding to his companions.\\n“The convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of Flotsam\\nPoint, and they immediately plunged into the Far West forests, after\\ncrossing Tadorn Marsh. They then followed almost the same route that we\\ntook on leaving Granite House. This explains the traces we found in the\\nwood. But, arriving on the shore, the convicts saw at once that they\\nwould discover no suitable retreat there, and it was then that, going\\nnorthwards again, they came upon the corral.”\\n\\n“Where they have perhaps returned,” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“I do not think so,” answered the engineer, “for they would naturally\\nsuppose that our researches would be in that direction. The corral is\\nonly a storehouse to them, and not a definitive encampment.”\\n\\n“I am of Cyrus’ opinion,” said the reporter, “and I think that it is\\namong the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made their\\nlair.”\\n\\n“Then, captain, straight to the corral!” cried Pencroft. “We must finish\\nthem off, and till now we have only lost time!”\\n\\n“No, my friend,” replied the engineer; “you forget that we have a reason\\nfor wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not contain some\\nhabitation. Our exploration has a double object, Pencroft. If, on the\\none hand, we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of\\ngratitude to perform.”\\n\\n“That was well said, captain,” replied the sailor, “but, all the same,\\nit is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until he pleases.”\\n\\nAnd truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was probable\\nthat the stranger’s retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself.\\n\\nThat evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The camp was\\norganized as usual, and the customary precautions were taken for the\\nnight. Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before\\nhis illness, derived great benefit from this life in the open air,\\nbetween the sea breezes and the vivifying air from the forests. His\\nplace was no longer in the cart, but at the head of the troop.\\n\\nThe next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the shore,\\nwhere, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so picturesquely\\npiled up, ascended the river by its left bank. The road had been already\\npartly cleared in their former excursions made from the corral to the\\nwest coast. The settlers were now about six miles from Mount Franklin.\\n\\nThe engineer’s plan was this:--To minutely survey the valley forming\\nthe bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the neighborhood of the\\ncorral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it by force; if it was not,\\nto entrench themselves there and make it the center of the operations\\nwhich had for their object the exploration of Mount Franklin.\\n\\nThis plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they were\\nimpatient to regain entire possession of their island.\\n\\nThey made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the\\nlargest spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the river’s bank,\\nbecame rare on the upper slopes of the mountain. The ground was hilly\\nand rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over which they did not\\nventure without extreme precaution. Top and Jup skirmished on the\\nflanks, springing right and left through the thick brushwood, and\\nemulating each other in intelligence and activity. But nothing showed\\nthat the banks of the stream had been recently frequented--nothing\\nannounced either the presence or the proximity of the convicts. Towards\\nfive in the evening the cart stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade.\\nA semicircular screen of trees still hid it.\\n\\nIt was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to ascertain if it\\nwas occupied. To go there openly, in broad daylight, when the convicts\\nwere probably in ambush, would be to expose themselves, as poor Herbert\\nhad done, to the firearms of the ruffians. It was better, then, to wait\\nuntil night came on.\\n\\nHowever, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the\\napproaches to the corral, and Pencroft, who was quite out of patience,\\nvolunteered to accompany him.\\n\\n“No, my friends,” said the engineer, “wait till night. I will not allow\\none of you to expose himself in open day.”\\n\\n“But, captain--” answered the sailor, little disposed to obey.\\n\\n“I beg of you, Pencroft,” said the engineer.\\n\\n“Very well!” replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another way, by\\nbestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime vocabulary.\\n\\nThe colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully watched\\nthe neighboring parts of the forest.\\n\\nThree hours passed thus. The wind had fallen, and absolute silence\\nreigned under the great trees. The snapping of the smallest twig, a\\nfootstep on the dry leaves, the gliding of a body among the grass, would\\nhave been heard without difficulty. All was quiet. Besides, Top, lying\\non the grass, his head stretched out on his paws, gave no sign of\\nuneasiness. At eight o’clock the day appeared far enough advanced for\\nthe reconnaissance to be made under favorable conditions. Gideon Spilett\\ndeclared himself ready to set out accompanied by Pencroft. Cyrus Harding\\nconsented. Top and Jup were to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and\\nNeb, for a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm.\\n\\n“Do not be imprudent,” said Harding to the reporter and Pencroft, “you\\nhave not to gain possession of the corral, but only to find out whether\\nit is occupied or not.”\\n\\n“All right,” answered Pencroft.\\n\\nAnd the two departed.\\n\\nUnder the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the obscurity\\nrendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty\\nfeet. The reporter and Pencroft, halting at any suspicious sound,\\nadvanced with great caution.\\n\\nThey walked a little distance apart from each other so as to offer a\\nless mark for a shot. And, to tell the truth, they expected every moment\\nto hear a report. Five minutes after leaving the cart, Gideon Spilett\\nand Pencroft arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond\\nwhich rose the palisade.\\n\\nThey stopped. A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of\\ntrees. Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral, which appeared\\nto be closed. This thirty feet, which it was necessary to cross from\\nthe wood to the palisade, constituted the dangerous zone, to borrow\\na ballistic term: in fact, one or more bullets fired from behind the\\npalisade might knock over any one who ventured on to this zone. Gideon\\nSpilett and the sailor were not men to draw back, but they knew that\\nany imprudence on their part, of which they would be the first victims,\\nwould fall afterwards on their companions. If they themselves were\\nkilled, what would become of Harding, Neb, and Herbert?\\n\\nBut Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral where he\\nsupposed the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press forward, when\\nthe reporter held him back with a grasp of iron.\\n\\n“In a few minutes it will be quite dark,” whispered Spilett in the\\nsailor’s ear, “then will be the time to act.”\\n\\nPencroft, convulsively clasping the butt-end of his gun, restrained his\\nenergies, and waited, swearing to himself.\\n\\nSoon the last of the twilight faded away. Darkness, which seemed as if\\nit issued from the dense forest, covered the clearing. Mount Franklin\\nrose like an enormous screen before the western horizon, and night\\nspread rapidly over all, as it does in regions of low latitudes. Now was\\nthe time.\\n\\nThe reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge of the\\nwood, had not once lost sight of the palisade. The corral appeared to\\nbe absolutely deserted. The top of the palisade formed a line, a\\nlittle darker than the surrounding shadow, and nothing disturbed its\\ndistinctness. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have\\nposted one of their number to guard against any surprise.\\n\\nSpilett grasped his companion’s hand, and both crept towards the corral,\\ntheir guns ready to fire.\\n\\nThey reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by a single\\nray of light.\\n\\nPencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and he had\\nsupposed, was closed. However, the sailor was able to ascertain that the\\nouter bars had not been put up. It might, then, be concluded that the\\nconvicts were there in the corral, and that very probably they had\\nfastened the gate in such a way that it could not be forced open.\\n\\nGideon Spilett and Pencroft listened.\\n\\nNot a sound could be heard inside the palisade. The musmons and the\\ngoats, sleeping no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the calm of\\nnight.\\n\\nThe reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves whether\\nthey had not better scale the palisades and penetrate into the corral.\\nThis would have been contrary to Cyrus Harding’s instructions.\\n\\nIt is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also fail.\\nNow, if the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew nothing of\\nthe expedition against them, if, lastly, there now existed a chance\\nof surprising them, ought this chance to be lost by inconsiderately\\nattempting to cross the palisades?\\n\\nThis was not the reporter’s opinion. He thought it better to wait until\\nall the settlers were collected together before attempting to penetrate\\ninto the corral. One thing was certain, that it was possible to reach\\nthe palisade without being seen, and also that it did not appear to be\\nguarded. This point settled, there was nothing to be done but to return\\nto the cart, where they would consult.\\n\\nPencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the\\nreporter without making any objection when the latter turned back to the\\nwood.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of\\naffairs.\\n\\n“Well,” said he, after a little thought, “I now have reason to believe\\nthat the convicts are not in the corral.”\\n\\n“We shall soon know,” said Pencroft, “when we have scaled the palisade.”\\n\\n“To the corral, my friends!” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Shall we leave the cart in the wood?” asked Neb.\\n\\n“No,” replied the engineer, “it is our wagon of ammunition and\\nprovisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an entrenchment.”\\n\\n“Forward, then!” said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\nThe cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly towards the\\npalisade. The darkness was now profound, the silence as complete as\\nwhen Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground. The thick grass\\ncompletely muffled their footsteps. The colonists held themselves ready\\nto fire. Jup, at Pencroft’s orders, kept behind. Neb led Top in a leash,\\nto prevent him from bounding forward.\\n\\nThe clearing soon came in sight. It was deserted. Without hesitating,\\nthe little band moved towards the palisade. In a short space of time the\\ndangerous zone was passed. Neb remained at the onagers’ heads to hold\\nthem. The engineer, the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to\\nthe door, in order to ascertain if it was barricaded inside. It was\\nopen!\\n\\n“What do you say now?” asked the engineer, turning to the sailor and\\nSpilett.\\n\\nBoth were stupefied.\\n\\n“I can swear,” said Pencroft, “that this gate was shut just now!”\\n\\nThe colonists now hesitated. Were the convicts in the corral when\\nPencroft and the reporter made their reconnaissance? It could not be\\ndoubted, as the gate then closed could only have been opened by them.\\nWere they still there, or had one of their number just gone out?\\n\\nAll these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of\\nthe colonists, but how could they be answered?\\n\\nAt that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the\\nenclosure, drew back hurriedly, and seized Harding’s hand.\\n\\n“What’s the matter?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“A light!”\\n\\n“In the house?”\\n\\n“Yes!”\\n\\nAll five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them, they saw\\nglimmering a feeble light. Cyrus Harding made up his mind rapidly. “It\\nis our only chance,” said he to his companions, “of finding the convicts\\ncollected in this house, suspecting nothing! They are in our power!\\nForward!” The colonists crossed through the enclosure, holding their\\nguns ready in their hands. The cart had been left outside under the\\ncharge of Jup and Top, who had been prudently tied to it.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert and Neb\\non the other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the absolutely dark\\nand deserted corral.\\n\\nIn a few moments they were near the closed door of the house.\\n\\nHarding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the window,\\nthen feebly lighted by the inner light.\\n\\nHe gazed into the apartment.\\n\\nOn the table burned a lantern. Near the table was the bed formerly used\\nby Ayrton.\\n\\nOn the bed lay the body of a man.\\n\\nSuddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,--“Ayrton!” he\\nexclaimed.\\n\\nImmediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists\\nrushed into the room.\\n\\nAyrton appeared to be asleep. His countenance showed that he had long\\nand cruelly suffered. On his wrists and ankles could be seen great\\nbruises.\\n\\nHarding bent over him.\\n\\n“Ayrton!” cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he had\\njust found again under such unexpected circumstances.\\n\\nAt this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at Harding, then\\nat the others,--\\n\\n“You!” he cried, “you?”\\n\\n“Ayrton! Ayrton!” repeated Harding.\\n\\n“Where am I?”\\n\\n“In the house in the corral!”\\n\\n“Alone?”\\n\\n“Yes!”\\n\\n“But they will come back!” cried Ayrton. “Defend yourselves! defend\\nyourselves!”\\n\\nAnd he fell back exhausted.\\n\\n“Spilett,” exclaimed the engineer, “we may be attacked at any moment.\\nBring the cart into the corral. Then, barricade the door, and all come\\nback here.”\\n\\nPencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the engineer’s\\norders. There was not a moment to be lost. Perhaps even now the cart was\\nin the hands of the convicts!\\n\\nIn a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral\\nand reached the gate of the palisade behind which Top was heard growling\\nsullenly.\\n\\nThe engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to fire.\\nHerbert was at his side. Both surveyed the crest of the spur overlooking\\nthe corral. If the convicts were lying in ambush there, they might knock\\nthe settlers over one after the other.\\n\\nAt that moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of\\nthe forest, and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the\\nenclosure. The corral, with its clumps of trees, the little stream which\\nwatered it, its wide carpet of grass, was suddenly illuminated. From\\nthe side of the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade stood\\nout white in the moonlight. On the opposite side towards the door, the\\nenclosure remained dark. A black mass soon appeared. This was the cart\\nentering the circle of light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise\\nmade by the door, as his companions shut it and fastened the interior\\nbars.\\n\\nBut, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark furiously and\\nrush to the back of the corral, to the right of the house.\\n\\n“Be ready to fire, my friends!” cried Harding.\\n\\nThe colonists raised their pieces and waited the moment to fire.\\n\\nTop still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered shrill\\ncries.\\n\\nThe colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the little\\nstream, shaded by large trees. And there, in the bright moonlight, what\\ndid they see? Five corpses, stretched on the bank!\\n\\nThey were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had landed\\non Lincoln Island!\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\nHow had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton? No, for\\na moment before he was dreading their return.\\n\\nBut Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer\\npossible to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had again\\nbecome unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the bed.\\n\\nThe colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the\\ninfluence of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving\\nAyrton’s house, or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the\\nconvicts. It was very probable that Ayrton would not be able to throw\\nany light on the circumstances under which the bodies had been found,\\nsince he himself was not aware that he was in the corral. But at any\\nrate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken\\nplace before this terrible execution. The next day Ayrton awoke from his\\ntorpor, and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt,\\non seeing him again, almost safe and sound, after a hundred and four\\ndays separation.\\n\\nAyrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at least, as\\nmuch as he knew.\\n\\nThe day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last November,\\nat nightfall, he was surprised by the convicts, who had scaled the\\npalisade. They bound and gagged him; then he was led to a dark cavern,\\nat the foot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had taken refuge.\\n\\nHis death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts were\\nabout to kill him, when one of them recognized him and called him by\\nthe name which he bore in Australia. The wretches had no scruples as to\\nmurdering Ayrton! They spared Ben Joyce!\\n\\nBut from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of his\\nformer accomplices. They wished him to join them again, and relied upon\\nhis aid to enable them to gain possession of Granite House, to penetrate\\ninto that hitherto inaccessible dwelling, and to become masters of the\\nisland, after murdering the colonists!\\n\\nAyrton remained firm. The once convict, now repentant and pardoned,\\nwould rather die than betray his companions. Ayrton--bound, gagged, and\\nclosely watched--lived in this cave for four months.\\n\\nNevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after\\ntheir arrival in the island, and since then they had subsisted on\\nAyrton’s stores, but did not live at the corral.\\n\\nOn the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the\\ncolonists’ arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned, boasting\\nof having killed one of the inhabitants of the island; but he returned\\nalone. His companion, as is known, fell by Cyrus Harding’s dagger.\\n\\nAyrton’s anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the news of\\nHerbert’s death. The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed,\\nat the mercy of the convicts. After this event, and during all the\\ntime that the colonists, detained by Herbert’s illness, remained in the\\ncorral, the pirates did not leave their cavern, and even after they had\\npillaged the plateau of Prospect Heights, they did not think it prudent\\nto abandon it.\\n\\nThe ill-treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled. His hands and\\nfeet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound him day and\\nnight. Every moment he expected to be put to death, nor did it appear\\npossible that he could escape.\\n\\nMatters remained thus until the third week of February. The convicts,\\nstill watching for a favorable opportunity, rarely quitted their\\nretreat, and only made a few hunting excursions, either to the interior\\nof the island, or the south coast.\\n\\nAyrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all hope\\nof ever seeing them again. At last, the unfortunate man, weakened\\nby ill-treatment, fell into a prostration so profound that sight and\\nhearing failed him. From that moment, that is to say, since the last two\\ndays, he could give no information whatever of what had occurred.\\n\\n“But, Captain Harding,” he added, “since I was imprisoned in that\\ncavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?”\\n\\n“How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the\\nenclosure?” answered the engineer.\\n\\n“Dead!” cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding his\\nweakness.\\n\\nHis companions supported him. He wished to get up, and with their\\nassistance he did so. They then proceeded together towards the little\\nstream.\\n\\nIt was now broad daylight.\\n\\nThere, on the bank, in the position in which they had been stricken\\nby death in its most instantaneous form, lay the corpses of the five\\nconvicts!\\n\\nAyrton was astounded. Harding and his companions looked at him without\\nuttering a word. On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroft examined\\nthe bodies, already stiffened by the cold.\\n\\nThey bore no apparent trace of any wound.\\n\\nOnly, after carefully examining them, Pencroft found on the forehead of\\none, on the chest of another, on the back of this one, on the shoulder\\nof that, a little red spot, a sort of scarcely visible bruise, the cause\\nof which it was impossible to conjecture.\\n\\n“It is there that they have been struck!” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“But with what weapon?” cried the reporter.\\n\\n“A weapon, lightning-like in its effects, and of which we have not the\\nsecret!”\\n\\n“And who has struck the blow?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“The avenging power of the island,” replied Harding, “he who brought you\\nhere, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested itself, who does\\nfor us all that which we cannot do for ourselves, and who, his will\\naccomplished, conceals himself from us.”\\n\\n“Let us make search for him, then!” exclaimed Pencroft.\\n\\n“Yes, we will search for him,” answered Harding, “but we shall not\\ndiscover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until he pleases\\nto call us to him!”\\n\\nThis invisible protection, which rendered their own action unavailing,\\nboth irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative inferiority which\\nit proved was of a nature to wound a haughty spirit. A generosity\\nevinced in such a manner as to elude all tokens of gratitude, implied a\\nsort of disdain for those on whom the obligation was conferred, which in\\nCyrus Harding’s eyes marred, in some degree, the worth of the benefit.\\n\\n“Let us search,” he resumed, “and God grant that we may some day be\\npermitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to deal\\nwith ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay him, by\\nrendering him in our turn, although at the price of our lives, some\\nsignal service!”\\n\\nFrom this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island were\\nsolely occupied with the intended search. Everything incited them to\\ndiscover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would only be the\\nname of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in some degree\\nsuperhuman power.\\n\\nIn a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their\\ninfluence soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy. Neb\\nand Pencroft carried the corpses of the convicts into the forest, some\\ndistance from the corral, and buried them deep in the ground.\\n\\nAyrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during\\nhis seclusion. He learned Herbert’s adventures, and through what various\\ntrials the colonists had passed. As to the settlers, they had despaired\\nof ever seeing Ayrton again, and had been convinced that the convicts\\nhad ruthlessly murdered him.\\n\\n“And now,” said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, “a duty remains\\nfor us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but although the\\nconvicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing to ourselves that\\nwe are once more masters of the island.”\\n\\n“Well!” answered Gideon Spilett, “let us search all this labyrinth of\\nthe spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a hollow, not a hole\\nunexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a\\nmystery, it is I who now speak to you, my friends!”\\n\\n“And we will not return to Granite House until we have found our\\nbenefactor,” said Herbert.\\n\\n“Yes,” said the engineer, “we will do all that it is humanly possible to\\ndo, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself permits us.”\\n\\n“Shall we stay at the corral?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“We shall stay here,” answered Harding. “Provisions are abundant, and we\\nare here in the very center of the circle we have to explore. Besides,\\nif necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House.”\\n\\n“Good!” answered the sailor. “Only I have a remark to make.”\\n\\n“What is it?”\\n\\n“Here is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that we have\\na voyage to make.”\\n\\n“A voyage?” said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Yes, to Tabor Island,” answered Pencroft. “It is necessary to carry a\\nnotice there to point out the position of our island and say that Ayrton\\nis here in case the Scotch yacht should come to take him off. Who knows\\nif it is not already too late?”\\n\\n“But, Pencroft,” asked Ayrton, “how do you intend to make this voyage?”\\n\\n“In the ‘Bonadventure.’”\\n\\n“The ‘Bonadventure!’” exclaimed Ayrton. “She no longer exists.”\\n\\n“My ‘Bonadventure’ exists no longer!” shouted Pencroft, bounding from\\nhis seat.\\n\\n“No,” answered Ayrton. “The convicts discovered her in her little harbor\\nonly eight days ago, they put to sea in her--”\\n\\n“And?” said Pencroft, his heart beating.\\n\\n“And not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks, and the\\nvessel went to pieces.”\\n\\n“Oh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!” exclaimed\\nPencroft.\\n\\n“Pencroft,” said Herbert, taking the sailor’s hand, “we will build\\nanother ‘Bonadventure’--a larger one. We have all the ironwork--all the\\nrigging of the brig at our disposal.”\\n\\n“But do you know,” returned Pencroft, “that it will take at least five\\nor six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty tons?”\\n\\n“We can take our time,” said the reporter, “and we must give up the\\nvoyage to Tabor Island for this year.”\\n\\n“Oh, my ‘Bonadventure!’ my poor ‘Bonadventure!’” cried Pencroft, almost\\nbroken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so\\nproud.\\n\\nThe loss of the “Bonadventure” was certainly a thing to be lamented by\\nthe colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should be repaired\\nas soon as possible. This settled, they now occupied themselves with\\nbringing their researches to bear on the most secret parts of the\\nisland.\\n\\nThe exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of February, and\\nlasted an entire week. The base of the mountain, with its spurs and\\ntheir numberless ramifications, formed a labyrinth of valleys and\\nelevations. It was evident that there, in the depths of these narrow\\ngorges, perhaps even in the interior of Mount Franklin itself, was the\\nproper place to pursue their researches. No part of the island could\\nhave been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to\\nremain unknown. But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that\\nCyrus Harding was obliged to conduct the exploration in a strictly\\nmethodical manner.\\n\\nThe colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the\\nvolcano, and which first received the waters of Falls River. There\\nAyrton showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken refuge, and\\nin which he had been imprisoned until his removal to the corral. This\\ncavern was just as Ayrton had left it. They found there a considerable\\nquantity of ammunition and provisions, conveyed thither by the convicts\\nin order to form a reserve.\\n\\nThe whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and\\nother trees, was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of the\\nsouthwestern spur, the colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the\\npicturesque columns of basalt on the coast. Here the trees were fewer.\\nStones took the place of grass. Goats and musmons gambolled among the\\nrocks. Here began the barren part of the island. It could already be\\nseen that, of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of Mount\\nFranklin, three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the\\ncorral, which bordered on the west on the Falls River valley, and on the\\neast on the Red Creek valley. These two streams, which lower down became\\nrivers by the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the\\nsprings of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern\\npart. As to the Mercy, it was more directly fed from ample springs\\nconcealed under the cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by springs of\\nthis nature, spreading in a thousand streamlets, that the soil of the\\nSerpentine Peninsula was watered.\\n\\nNow, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have served as a\\nretreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary\\nfor life. But the settlers had already explored them, and in no part had\\nthey discovered the presence of man.\\n\\nWas it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst of the\\npiles of rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the streams of\\nlava, that this dwelling and its occupant would be found?\\n\\nThe northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed solely of\\ntwo valleys, wide, not very deep, without any appearance of vegetation,\\nstrewn with masses of rock, paved with lava, and varied with great\\nblocks of mineral. This region required a long and careful exploration.\\nIt contained a thousand cavities, comfortless no doubt, but perfectly\\nconcealed and difficult of access.\\n\\nThe colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the volcanic\\nperiod, still black from the passage of the fire, and penetrated into\\nthe depths of the mountain. They traversed these somber galleries,\\nwaving lighted torches; they examined the smallest excavations; they\\nsounded the shallowest depths, but all was dark and silent. It did\\nnot appear that the foot of man had ever before trodden these ancient\\npassages, or that his arm had ever displaced one of these blocks, which\\nremained as the volcano had cast them up above the waters, at the time\\nof the submersion of the island.\\n\\nHowever, although these passages appeared to be absolutely deserted, and\\nthe obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged to confess that\\nabsolute silence did not reign there.\\n\\nOn arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending several\\nhundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear\\na deep rumbling noise, increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the\\nrocks.\\n\\nGideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant\\nmutterings, which indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires.\\nSeveral times both listened, and they agreed that some chemical process\\nwas taking place in the bowels of the earth.\\n\\n“Then the volcano is not totally extinct?” said the reporter.\\n\\n“It is possible that since our exploration of the crater,” replied Cyrus\\nHarding, “some change has occurred. Any volcano, although considered\\nextinct, may evidently again burst forth.”\\n\\n“But if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred,” asked Spilett, “would\\nthere not be some danger to Lincoln Island?”\\n\\n“I do not think so,” answered the reporter. “The crater, that is to\\nsay, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and lava, would\\nescape, as it did formerly, by this customary outlet.”\\n\\n“Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts\\nof the island!”\\n\\n“And why, my dear Spilett,” answered Cyrus Harding, “should it not\\nfollow the road naturally traced out for it?”\\n\\n“Well, volcanoes are capricious,” returned the reporter.\\n\\n“Notice,” answered the engineer, “that the inclination of Mount Franklin\\nfavors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are exploring just\\nnow. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be necessary to change\\nthe mountain’s center of gravity.”\\n\\n“But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,” observed\\nGideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Always,” replied the engineer, “especially when the subterranean forces\\nbegin to awake, as they risk meeting with some obstruction, after a long\\nrest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing\\nfor us, and it would be better that the volcano should not have the\\nslightest desire to wake up. But we could not prevent it, could we? At\\nany rate, even if it should occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would\\nbe seriously threatened. Between them and the mountain, the ground\\nis considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course\\ntowards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring\\nparts of Shark Gulf.”\\n\\n“We have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to indicate\\nan approaching eruption,” said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“No,” answered Harding, “not a vapor escapes from the crater, for it\\nwas only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit. But it\\nis probable that at the lower part of the chimney, time may have\\naccumulated rocks, cinders, hardened lava, and that this valve of which\\nI spoke, may at any time become overcharged. But at the first serious\\neffort, every obstacle will disappear, and you may be certain, my dear\\nSpilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler, nor the\\nvolcano, which is the chimney, will burst under the pressure of gas.\\nNevertheless, I repeat, it would be better that there should not be an\\neruption.”\\n\\n“And yet we are not mistaken,” remarked the reporter. “Mutterings can be\\ndistinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano!”\\n\\n“You are right,” said the engineer, again listening attentively. “There\\ncan be no doubt of it. A commotion is going on there, of which we can\\nneither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result.”\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their companions, to\\nwhom they made known the state of affairs.\\n\\n“Very well!” cried Pencroft, “The volcano wants to play his pranks! Let\\nhim try, if he likes! He will find his master!”\\n\\n“Who?” asked Neb.\\n\\n“Our good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth for him,\\nif he so much as pretends to open it!”\\n\\nAs may be seen, the sailor’s confidence in the tutelary deity of his\\nisland was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power, manifested until\\nnow in so many inexplicable ways, appeared to be unlimited; but also it\\nknew how to escape the colonists’ most minute researches, for, in\\nspite of all their efforts, in spite of the more than zeal,--the\\nobstinacy,--with which they carried on their exploration, the retreat of\\nthe mysterious being could not be discovered.\\n\\nFrom the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was\\nextended to all the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most secret\\nnooks were explored. The colonists even went the length of tapping every\\nrock. The search was extended to the extreme verge of the mountain. It\\nwas explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating\\nthe first row of rocks, then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat, at\\nthe bottom of which opened the crater.\\n\\nThey did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose depths\\nthe rumbling could be distinctly heard. However, no sign of smoke or\\nvapor, no heating of the rock, indicated an approaching eruption.\\nBut neither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the\\ncolonists find any traces of him of whom they were in search.\\n\\nTheir investigations were then directed to the downs. They carefully\\nexamined the high lava-cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base to the crest,\\nalthough it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf.\\nNo one!--nothing!\\n\\nIndeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue uselessly\\nexpended, so much energy producing no results, that somewhat of anger\\nmingled with the discomfiture of Cyrus Harding and his companions.\\n\\nIt was now time to think of returning, for these researches could not be\\nprolonged indefinitely. The colonists were certainly right in believing\\nthat the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island,\\nand the wildest fancies haunted their excited imaginations. Pencroft\\nand Neb, particularly, were not contented with the mystery, but allowed\\ntheir imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural.\\n\\nOn the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House, and by\\nmeans of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the threshold of the\\ndoor, they re-established communication between their habitation and the\\nground.\\n\\nA month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third\\nanniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\nThree years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners from\\nRichmond, and how often during those three years had they spoken of\\ntheir country, always present in their thoughts!\\n\\nThey had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them it\\nappeared impossible that the just cause of the North had not triumphed.\\nBut what had been the incidents of this terrible war? How much blood had\\nit not cost? How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?\\nThey often spoke of these things, without as yet being able to foresee\\nthe day when they would be permitted once more to see their country.\\nTo return thither, were it but for a few days, to renew the social link\\nwith the inhabited world, to establish a communication between their\\nnative land and their island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the\\nbest, portion of their existence in this colony, founded by them,\\nand which would then be dependent on their country, was this a dream\\nimpossible to realize?\\n\\nThere were only two ways of accomplishing it--either a ship must appear\\noff Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a vessel\\nstrong enough to sail to the nearest land.\\n\\n“Unless,” said Pencroft, “our good genius, himself provides us with the\\nmeans of returning to our country.”\\n\\nAnd, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of 300 tons\\nwas waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon, they would not\\neven have made a gesture of surprise. In their state of mind nothing\\nappeared improbable.\\n\\nBut Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine themselves to\\nfact, and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel--a\\nreally urgent work, since it was for the purpose of depositing, as\\nsoon as possible, at Tabor Island a document indicating Ayrton’s new\\nresidence.\\n\\nAs the “Bonadventure” no longer existed, six months at least would\\nbe required for the construction of a new vessel. Now winter was\\napproaching, and the voyage would not be made before the following\\nspring.\\n\\n“We have time to get everything ready for the fine season,” remarked\\nthe engineer, who was consulting with Pencroft about these matters. “I\\nthink, therefore, my friend, that since we have to rebuild our vessel\\nit will be best to give her larger dimensions. The arrival of the Scotch\\nyacht at Tabor Island is very uncertain. It may even be that, having\\narrived several months ago, she has again sailed after having vainly\\nsearched for some trace of Ayrton. Will it not then be best to build\\na ship which, if necessary, could take us either to the Polynesian\\nArchipelago or to New Zealand? What do you think?”\\n\\n“I think, captain,” answered the sailor; “I think that you are as\\ncapable of building a large vessel as a small one. Neither the wood nor\\nthe tools are wanting. It is only a question of time.”\\n\\n“And how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to\\n300 tons?” asked Harding.\\n\\n“Seven or eight months at least,” replied Pencroft. “But it must not be\\nforgotten that winter is drawing near, and that in severe frost wood is\\ndifficult to work. We must calculate on several weeks delay, and if our\\nvessel is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky.”\\n\\n“Well,” replied Cyrus Harding, “that will be exactly the most favorable\\ntime for undertaking a voyage of any importance, either to Tabor Island\\nor to a more distant land.”\\n\\n“So it will, captain,” answered the sailor. “Make out your plans then;\\nthe workmen are ready, and I imagine that Ayrton can lend us a good\\nhelping hand.”\\n\\nThe colonists, having been consulted, approved the engineer’s plan,\\nand it was, indeed, the best thing to be done. It is true that the\\nconstruction of a ship of from two to three hundred tons would be great\\nlabor, but the colonists had confidence in themselves, justified by\\ntheir previous success.\\n\\nCyrus Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and\\nmaking the model. During this time his companions employed themselves in\\nfelling and carting trees to furnish the ribs, timbers, and planks.\\nThe forest of the Far West supplied the best oaks and elms. They took\\nadvantage of the opening already made on their last excursion to form a\\npracticable road, which they named the Far West Road, and the trees were\\ncarried to the Chimneys, where the dockyard was established. As to\\nthe road in question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction\\nsomewhat capricious, but at the same time it facilitated the access to a\\nlarge part of the Serpentine Peninsula.\\n\\nIt was important that the trees should be quickly felled and cut up, for\\nthey could not be used while yet green, and some time was necessary to\\nallow them to get seasoned. The carpenters, therefore, worked vigorously\\nduring the month of April, which was troubled only by a few equinoctial\\ngales of some violence. Master Jup aided them dexterously, either by\\nclimbing to the top of a tree to fasten the ropes or by lending his\\nstout shoulders to carry the lopped trunks.\\n\\nAll this timber was piled up under a large shed, built near the\\nChimneys, and there awaited the time for use.\\n\\nThe month of April was tolerably fine, as October often is in the\\nnorthern zone. At the same time other work was actively continued, and\\nsoon all trace of devastation disappeared from the plateau of\\nProspect Heights. The mill was rebuilt, and new buildings rose in the\\npoultry-yard. It had appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions,\\nfor the feathered population had increased considerably. The stable\\nnow contained five onagers, four of which were well broken, and allowed\\nthemselves to be either driven or ridden, and a little colt. The colony\\nnow possessed a plow, to which the onagers were yoked like regular\\nYorkshire or Kentucky oxen. The colonists divided their work, and their\\narms never tired. Then who could have enjoyed better health than these\\nworkers, and what good humor enlivened the evenings in Granite House as\\nthey formed a thousand plans for the future!\\n\\nAs a matter of course Ayrton shared the common lot in every respect,\\nand there was no longer any talk of his going to live at the corral.\\nNevertheless he was still sad and reserved, and joined more in the work\\nthan in the pleasures of his companions. But he was a valuable workman\\nat need--strong, skilful, ingenious, intelligent. He was esteemed and\\nloved by all, and he could not be ignorant of it.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned. Every other day one of\\nthe settlers, driving the cart or mounted on an onager, went to look\\nafter the flock of musmons and goats and bring back the supply of\\nmilk required by Neb. These excursions at the same time afforded\\nopportunities for hunting. Therefore Herbert and Gideon Spilett, with\\nTop in front, traversed more often than their companions the road to\\nthe corral, and with the capital guns which they carried, capybaras,\\nagouties, kangaroos, and wild pigs for large game, ducks, grouse,\\njacamars, and snipe for small game, were never wanting in the house.\\nThe produce of the warren, of the oyster-bed, several turtles which were\\ntaken, excellent salmon which came up the Mercy, vegetables from the\\nplateau, wild fruit from the forest, were riches upon riches, and Neb,\\nthe head cook, could scarcely by himself store them away.\\n\\nThe telegraphic wire between the corral and Granite House had of course\\nbeen repaired, and it was worked whenever one or other of the settlers\\nwas at the corral and found it necessary to spend the night there.\\nBesides, the island was safe now and no attacks were to be feared, at\\nany rate from men.\\n\\nHowever, that which had happened might happen again. A descent of\\npirates, or even of escaped convicts, was always to be feared. It was\\npossible that companions or accomplices of Bob Harvey had been in the\\nsecret of his plans, and might be tempted to imitate him. The colonists,\\ntherefore, were careful to observe the sea around the island, and every\\nday their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by Union and Washington\\nBays. When they went to the corral they examined the sea to the west\\nwith no less attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended\\nover a large section of the western horizon.\\n\\nNothing suspicious was discerned, but still it was necessary for them to\\nbe on their guard.\\n\\nThe engineer one evening imparted to his friends a plan which he had\\nconceived for fortifying the corral. It appeared prudent to him to\\nheighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse, which,\\nif necessary, the settlers could hold against the enemy. Granite House\\nmight, by its very position, be considered impregnable; therefore the\\ncorral with its buildings, its stores, and the animals it contained,\\nwould always be the object of pirates, whoever they were, who might land\\non the island, and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves\\nup there they ought also to be able to defend themselves without any\\ndisadvantage. This was a project which might be left for consideration,\\nand they were, besides, obliged to put off its execution until the next\\nspring.\\n\\nAbout the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel lay along the dockyard,\\nand soon the stem and stern-post, mortised at each of its extremities,\\nrose almost perpendicularly. The keel, of good oak, measured 110 feet\\nin length, this allowing a width of five-and-twenty feet to the midship\\nbeam. But this was all the carpenters could do before the arrival of the\\nfrosts and bad weather. During the following week they fixed the first\\nof the stern timbers, but were then obliged to suspend work.\\n\\nDuring the last days of the month the weather was extremely bad. The\\nwind blew from the east, sometimes with the violence of a tempest. The\\nengineer was somewhat uneasy on account of the dockyard shed--which\\nbesides, he could not have established in any other place near to\\nGranite House--for the islet only imperfectly sheltered the shore from\\nthe fury of the open sea, and in great storms the waves beat against the\\nvery foot of the granite cliff.\\n\\nBut, very fortunately, these fears were not realized. The wind shifted\\nto the southeast, and there the beach of Granite House was completely\\ncovered by Flotsam Point.\\n\\nPencroft and Ayrton, the most zealous workmen at the new vessel, pursued\\ntheir labor as long as they could. They were not men to mind the wind\\ntearing at their hair, nor the rain wetting them to the skin, and a blow\\nfrom a hammer is worth just as much in bad as in fine weather. But when\\na severe frost succeeded this wet period, the wood, its fibers acquiring\\nthe hardness of iron, became extremely difficult to work, and about the\\n10th of June shipbuilding was obliged to be entirely discontinued.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe\\nwas the temperature during the winters of Lincoln Island. The cold was\\ncomparable to that experienced in the States of New England, situated at\\nalmost the same distance from the equator. In the northern hemisphere,\\nor at any rate in the part occupied by British America and the north of\\nthe United States, this phenomenon is explained by the flat conformation\\nof the territories bordering on the pole, and on which there is no\\nintumescence of the soil to oppose any obstacle to the north winds;\\nhere, in Lincoln Island, this explanation would not suffice.\\n\\n“It has even been observed,” remarked Harding one day to his companions,\\n“that in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions are less tried by\\nthe cold than inland countries. I have often heard it asserted that the\\nwinters of Lombardy, for example, are not less rigorous than those of\\nScotland, which results from the sea restoring during the winter the\\nheat which it received during the summer. Islands are, therefore, in a\\nbetter situation for benefiting by this restitution.”\\n\\n“But then, Captain Harding,” asked Herbert, “why does Lincoln Island\\nappear to escape the common law?”\\n\\n“That is difficult to explain,” answered the engineer. “However, I\\nshould be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results from the\\nsituation of the island in the Southern Hemisphere, which, as you know,\\nmy boy, is colder than the Northern Hemisphere.”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Herbert, “and icebergs are met with in lower latitudes in\\nthe south than in the north of the Pacific.”\\n\\n“That is true,” remarked Pencroft, “and when I have been serving on\\nboard whalers I have seen icebergs off Cape Horn.”\\n\\n“The severe cold experienced in Lincoln Island,” said Gideon Spilett,\\n“may then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs\\ncomparatively near to Lincoln Island.”\\n\\n“Your opinion is very admissible indeed, my dear Spilett,” answered\\nCyrus Harding, “and it is evidently to the proximity of icebergs that\\nwe owe our rigorous winters. I would draw your attention also to an\\nentirely physical cause, which renders the Southern colder than the\\nNorthern Hemisphere. In fact, since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere\\nduring the summer, it is necessarily more distant during the winter.\\nThis explains then the excess of temperature in the two seasons, for, if\\nwe find the winters very cold in Lincoln Island, we must not forget that\\nthe summers here, on the contrary, are very hot.”\\n\\n“But why, if you please, captain,” asked Pencroft, knitting his brows,\\n“why should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided? It isn’t\\njust, that!”\\n\\n“Friend Pencroft,” answered the engineer, laughing, “whether just\\nor not, we must submit to it, and here lies the reason for this\\npeculiarity. The earth does not describe a circle around the sun, but\\nan ellipse, as it must by the laws of rational mechanics. Now, the earth\\noccupies one of the foci of the ellipse, and so at one point in its\\ncourse is at its apogee, that is, at its farthest from the sun, and\\nat another point it is at its perigee, or nearest to the sun. Now it\\nhappens that it is during the winter of the southern countries that\\nit is at its most distant point from the sun, and consequently, in a\\nsituation for those regions to feel the greatest cold. Nothing can be\\ndone to prevent that, and men, Pencroft, however learned they may be,\\ncan never change anything of the cosmographical order established by God\\nHimself.”\\n\\n“And yet,” added Pencroft, “the world is very learned. What a big book,\\ncaptain, might be made with all that is known!”\\n\\n“And what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!” answered\\nHarding.\\n\\nAt last, for one reason or another, the month of June brought the cold\\nwith its accustomed intensity, and the settlers were often confined to\\nGranite House. Ah! how wearisome this imprisonment was to them, and more\\nparticularly to Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Look here,” said he to Neb one day, “I would give you by notarial\\ndeed all the estates which will come to me some day, if you were a good\\nenough fellow to go, no matter where, and subscribe to some newspaper\\nfor me! Decidedly the thing that is most essential to my happiness is\\nthe knowing every morning what has happened the day before in other\\nplaces than this!”\\n\\nNeb began to laugh.\\n\\n“‘Pon my word,” he replied, “the only thing I think about is my daily\\nwork!”\\n\\nThe truth was that indoors as well as out there was no want of work.\\n\\nThe colony of Lincoln Island was now at its highest point of prosperity,\\nachieved by three years of continued hard work. The destruction of the\\nbrig had been a new source of riches. Without speaking of the complete\\nrig which would serve for the vessel now on the stocks, utensils and\\ntools of all sorts, weapons and ammunition, clothes and instruments,\\nwere now piled in the storerooms of Granite House. It had not even\\nbeen necessary to resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt\\nmaterials. Though the colonists had suffered from cold during their\\nfirst winter, the bad season might now come without their having any\\nreason to dread its severity. Linen was plentiful also, and besides,\\nthey kept it with extreme care. From chloride of sodium, which is\\nnothing else than sea salt, Cyrus Harding easily extracted the soda and\\nchlorine. The soda, which it was easy to change into carbonate of soda,\\nand the chlorine, of which he made chloride of lime, were employed for\\nvarious domestic purposes, and especially in bleaching linen. Besides,\\nthey did not wash more than four times a year, as was done by families\\nin the olden times, and it may be added, that Pencroft and Gideon\\nSpilett, while waiting for the postman to bring him his newspaper,\\ndistinguished themselves as washermen.\\n\\nSo passed the winter months, June, July, and August. They were severe,\\nand the average observations of the thermometer did not give more than\\neight degrees of Fahrenheit. It was therefore lower in temperature than\\nthe preceding winter. But then, what splendid fires blazed continually\\non the hearths of Granite House, the smoke marking the granite wall with\\nlong, zebra-like streaks! Fuel was not spared, as it grew naturally a\\nfew steps from them. Besides, the chips of the wood destined for the\\nconstruction of the ship enabled them to economize the coal, which\\nrequired more trouble to transport.\\n\\nMen and animals were all well. Master Jup was a little chilly, it must\\nbe confessed. This was perhaps his only weakness, and it was necessary\\nto make him a well-padded dressing-gown. But what a servant he was,\\nclever, zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet, not talkative, and\\nhe might have been with reason proposed as a model for all his biped\\nbrothers in the Old and New Worlds!\\n\\n“As for that,” said Pencroft, “when one has four hands at one’s service,\\nof course one’s work ought to be done so much the better!”\\n\\nAnd indeed the intelligent creature did it well.\\n\\nDuring the seven months which had passed since the last researches made\\nround the mountain, and during the month of September, which brought\\nback fine weather, nothing was heard of the genius of the island. His\\npower was not manifested in any way. It is true that it would have\\nbeen superfluous, for no incident occurred to put the colonists to any\\npainful trial.\\n\\nCyrus Harding even observed that if by chance the communication between\\nthe unknown and the tenants of Granite House had ever been established\\nthrough the granite, and if Top’s instinct had as it were felt it, there\\nwas no further sign of it during this period. The dog’s growling\\nhad entirely ceased, as well as the uneasiness of the orang. The two\\nfriends--for they were such--no longer prowled round the opening of the\\ninner well, nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from\\nthe first the engineer had noticed. But could he be sure that this was\\nall that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never\\narrive at a solution? Could he be certain that some conjuncture would\\nnot occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene? who\\ncould tell what the future might have in reserve?\\n\\nAt last the winter was ended, but an event, the consequences of which\\nmight be serious occurred in the first days of the returning spring.\\n\\nOn the 7th of September, Cyrus Harding, having observed the crater, saw\\nsmoke curling round the summit of the mountain, its first vapors rising\\nin the air.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\nThe colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed in\\nsilence at the summit of Mount Franklin.\\n\\nThe volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral layer\\nheaped at the bottom of the crater. But would the subterranean fires\\nprovoke any violent eruption? This was an event which could not be\\nforeseen. However, even while admitting the possibility of an eruption,\\nit was not probable that the whole of Lincoln Island would suffer from\\nit. The flow of volcanic matter is not always disastrous, and the island\\nhad already undergone this trial, as was shown by the streams of lava\\nhardened on the northern slopes of the mountain. Besides, from the shape\\nof the crater--the opening broken in the upper edge--the matter would be\\nthrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island.\\n\\nHowever, the past did not necessarily answer for the future. Often, at\\nthe summit of volcanoes, the old craters close and new ones open.\\nThis had occurred in the two hemispheres--at Etna, Popocatepetl, at\\nOrizabaand on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared.\\nIn fact, an earthquake--a phenomenon which often accompanies volcanic\\neruption--is enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain,\\nand to open new outlets for the burning lava.\\n\\nCyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and, without\\nexaggerating the state of things, he told them all the pros and cons.\\nAfter all, they could not prevent it. It did not appear likely that\\nGranite House would be threatened unless the ground was shaken by an\\nearthquake. But the corral would be in great danger should a new crater\\nopen in the southern side of Mount Franklin.\\n\\nFrom that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain,\\nand it could even be perceived that it increased in height and\\nthickness, without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes. The\\nphenomenon was still concentrated in the lower part of the central\\ncrater.\\n\\nHowever, with the fine days work had been continued. The building of the\\nvessel was hastened as much as possible, and, by means of the waterfall\\non the shore, Cyrus Harding managed to establish an hydraulic sawmill,\\nwhich rapidly cut up the trunks of trees into planks and joists. The\\nmechanism of this apparatus was as simple as those used in the rustic\\nsawmills of Norway. A first horizontal movement to move the piece of\\nwood, a second vertical movement to move the saw--this was all that was\\nwanted; and the engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders,\\nand pulleys properly arranged. Towards the end of the month of September\\nthe skeleton of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay\\nin the dockyard. The ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all the\\ntimbers having been sustained by a provisional band, the shape of the\\nvessel could already be seen. The schooner, sharp in the bows, very\\nslender in the after-part, would evidently be suitable for a long\\nvoyage, if wanted; but laying the planking would still take a\\nconsiderable time. Very fortunately, the iron work of the pirate brig\\nhad been saved after the explosion. From the planks and injured ribs\\nPencroft and Ayrton had extracted the bolts and a large quantity\\nof copper nails. It was so much work saved for the smiths, but the\\ncarpenters had much to do.\\n\\nShipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the haymaking,\\nand the gathering in of the different crops on the plateau. This work\\nfinished, every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner. When night\\ncame the workmen were really quite exhausted. So as not to lose any\\ntime they had changed the hours for their meals; they dined at twelve\\no’clock, and only had their supper when daylight failed them. They then\\nascended to Granite House, when they were always ready to go to bed.\\n\\nSometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some interesting\\nsubject the hour for sleep was delayed for a time. The colonists then\\nspoke of the future, and talked willingly of the changes which a voyage\\nin the schooner to inhabited lands would make in their situation.\\nBut always, in the midst of these plans, prevailed the thought of a\\nsubsequent return to Lincoln Island. Never would they abandon this\\ncolony, founded with so much labor and with such success, and to which\\na communication with America would afford a fresh impetus. Pencroft and\\nNeb especially hoped to end their days there.\\n\\n“Herbert,” said the sailor, “you will never abandon Lincoln Island?”\\n\\n“Never, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to stay\\nthere.”\\n\\n“That was made up long ago, my boy,” answered Pencroft. “I shall expect\\nyou. You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall make jolly\\nchaps of your youngsters!”\\n\\n“That’s agreed,” replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same\\ntime.\\n\\n“And you, Captain Harding,” resumed Pencroft enthusiastically, “you will\\nbe still the governor of the island! Ah, how many inhabitants could it\\nsupport? Ten thousand at least!”\\n\\nThey talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at last the\\nreporter actually started a newspaper--the New Lincoln Herald!\\n\\nSo is man’s heart. The desire to perform a work which will endure, which\\nwill survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living\\ncreatures here below. It is this which has established his dominion, and\\nthis it is which justifies it, over all the world.\\n\\nAfter that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their little\\ndream of the future.\\n\\nAyrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord Glenarvan\\nagain and show himself to all restored.\\n\\nOne evening, on the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged\\nlater than usual. It was nine o’clock. Already, long badly concealed\\nyawns gave warning of the hour of rest, and Pencroft was proceeding\\ntowards his bed, when the electric bell, placed in the dining-room,\\nsuddenly rang.\\n\\nAll were there, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Ayrton,\\nPencroft, Neb. Therefore none of the colonists were at the corral.\\n\\nCyrus Harding rose. His companions stared at each other, scarcely\\nbelieving their ears.\\n\\n“What does that mean?” cried Neb. “Was it the devil who rang it?”\\n\\nNo one answered.\\n\\n“The weather is stormy,” observed Herbert. “Might not its influence of\\nelectricity--”\\n\\nHerbert did not finish his phrase. The engineer, towards whom all eyes\\nwere turned, shook his head negatively.\\n\\n“We must wait,” said Gideon Spilett. “If it is a signal, whoever it may\\nbe who has made it, he will renew it.”\\n\\n“But who do you think it is?” cried Neb.\\n\\n“Who?” answered Pencroft, “but he--”\\n\\nThe sailor’s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell.\\n\\nHarding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the corral:--\\n\\n“What do you want?”\\n\\nA few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial, gave this\\nreply to the tenants of Granite House:--\\n\\n“Come to the corral immediately.”\\n\\n“At last!” exclaimed Harding.\\n\\nYes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The colonists’\\nfatigue had disappeared before the tremendous interest which was about\\nto urge them to the corral, and all wish for rest had ceased. Without\\nhaving uttered a word, in a few moments they had left Granite House,\\nand were standing on the beach. Jup and Top alone were left behind. They\\ncould do without them.\\n\\nThe night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same time as\\nthe sun. As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds formed a lowering\\nand heavy vault, preventing any star rays. A few lightning flashes,\\nreflections from a distant storm, illuminated the horizon.\\n\\nIt was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the\\nisland itself. The night was very threatening.\\n\\nBut however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them from\\nfinding the familiar road to the corral.\\n\\nThey ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau, passed\\nthe bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the forest.\\n\\nThey walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions. There was\\nno doubt but that they were now going to learn the long-searched-for\\nanswer to the enigma, the name of that mysterious being, so deeply\\nconcerned in their life, so generous in his influence, so powerful\\nin his action! Must not this stranger have indeed mingled with their\\nexistence, have known the smallest details, have heard all that was said\\nin Granite House, to have been able always to act in the very nick of\\ntime?\\n\\nEvery one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward. Under the\\narch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road\\ncould not be seen. Not a sound in the forest. Both animals and birds,\\ninfluenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained motionless\\nand silent. Not a breath disturbed the leaves. The footsteps of the\\ncolonists alone resounded on the hardened ground.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of an hour the silence was only interrupted by\\nthis remark from Pencroft:--\\n\\n“We ought to have brought a torch.”\\n\\nAnd by this reply from the engineer:--\\n\\n“We shall find one at the corral.”\\n\\nHarding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past\\nnine. At forty-seven minutes past nine they had traversed three out of\\nthe five miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral.\\n\\nAt that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined\\nthe dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them. Evidently\\nthe storm would not be long in bursting forth.\\n\\nThe flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant thunder\\ngrowled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.\\n\\nThe colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some\\nirresistible force.\\n\\nAt ten o’clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they\\nreached the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury.\\n\\nIn a minute the corral was crossed, and Harding stood before the hut.\\n\\nProbably the house was occupied by the stranger, since it was from\\nthence that the telegram had been sent. However, no light shone through\\nthe window.\\n\\nThe engineer knocked at the door.\\n\\nNo answer.\\n\\nCyrus Harding opened the door, and the settlers entered the room, which\\nwas perfectly dark. A light was struck by Neb, and in a few moments the\\nlantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room.\\n\\nThere was no one there. Everything was in the state in which it had been\\nleft.\\n\\n“Have we been deceived by an illusion?” murmured Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nNo! that was not possible! The telegram had clearly said,--\\n\\n“Come to the corral immediately.”\\n\\nThey approached the table specially devoted to the use of the wire.\\nEverything was in order--the pile on the box containing it, as well as\\nall the apparatus.\\n\\n“Who came here the last time?” asked the engineer.\\n\\n“I did, captain,” answered Ayrton.\\n\\n“And that was--”\\n\\n“Four days ago.”\\n\\n“Ah! a note!” cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table.\\n\\nOn this paper were written these words in English:--\\n\\n“Follow the new wire.”\\n\\n“Forward!” cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had not been\\nsent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat, communicating\\ndirectly with Granite House by means of a supplementary wire joined to\\nthe old one.\\n\\nNeb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral. The storm\\nthen burst forth with tremendous violence. The interval between each\\nlightning-flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly. The summit\\nof the volcano, with its plume of vapor, could be seen by occasional\\nflashes.\\n\\nThere was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral between\\nthe house and the palisade; but the engineer, running straight to the\\nfirst post, saw by the light of a flash a new wire hanging from the\\nisolator to the ground.\\n\\n“There it is!” said he.\\n\\nThis wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an isolating\\nsubstance like a submarine cable, so as to assure the free transmission\\nof the current. It appeared to pass through the wood and the southern\\nspurs of the mountain, and consequently it ran towards the west.\\n\\n“Follow it!” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nAnd the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the wire.\\n\\nThe thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could\\nbe heard. However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to get\\nforward as fast as possible.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between\\nthe corral valley and that of Falls River, which they crossed at its\\nnarrowest part. The wire, sometimes stretched over the lower branches\\nof the trees, sometimes lying on the ground, guided them surely. The\\nengineer had supposed that the wire would perhaps stop at the bottom of\\nthe valley, and that the stranger’s retreat would be there.\\n\\nNothing of the sort. They were obliged to ascend the south-western spur,\\nand re-descend on that arid plateau terminated by the strangely-wild\\nbasalt cliff. From time to time one of the colonists stooped down and\\nfelt for the wire with his hands; but there was now no doubt that the\\nwire was running directly towards the sea. There, to a certainty, in the\\ndepths of those rocks, was the dwelling so long sought for in vain.\\n\\nThe sky was literally on fire. Flash succeeded flash. Several struck the\\nsummit of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke. It appeared there\\nas if the mountain was vomiting flame. At a few minutes to eleven the\\ncolonists arrived on the high cliff overlooking the ocean to the west.\\nThe wind had risen. The surf roared 500 feet below.\\n\\nHarding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the corral.\\n\\nAt this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the steep side\\nof a narrow ravine. The settlers followed it at the risk of occasioning\\na fall of the slightly-balanced rocks, and being dashed into the sea.\\nThe descent was extremely perilous, but they did not think of the\\ndanger; they were no longer masters of themselves, and an irresistible\\nattraction drew them towards this mysterious place as the magnet draws\\niron.\\n\\nThus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even in\\nbroad daylight would have been considered impracticable.\\n\\nThe stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed\\nthrough the gleams of light. Harding was first--Ayrton last. On they\\nwent, step by step. Now they slid over the slippery rock; then they\\nstruggled to their feet and scrambled on.\\n\\nAt last the wire touched the rocks on the beach. The colonists had\\nreached the bottom of the basalt cliff.\\n\\nThere appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with\\nthe sea. The settlers followed the wire along it. They had not gone a\\nhundred paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the\\nlevel of the sea.\\n\\nThe engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the\\nwaves.\\n\\nHis companions were stupefied.\\n\\nA cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them! Must\\nthey then plunge beneath the water and seek there for some submarine\\ncavern? In their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it.\\n\\nThe engineer stopped them.\\n\\nHe led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there--\\n\\n“We must wait,” said he. “The tide is high. At low water the way will be\\nopen.”\\n\\n“But what can make you think-” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“He would not have called us if the means had been wanting to enable us\\nto reach him!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that no\\nobjection was raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was quite\\npossible that an opening, practicable at low water, though hidden now by\\nthe high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.\\n\\nThere was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently crouching\\nin a deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The thunder was\\nre-echoed among the rocks with a grand sonorousness.\\n\\nThe colonists’ emotion was great. A thousand strange and extraordinary\\nideas crossed their brains, and they expected some grand and superhuman\\napparition, which alone could come up to the notion they had formed of\\nthe mysterious genius of the island.\\n\\nAt midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the beach to\\nreconnoiter.\\n\\nThe engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense excavation\\ncould be seen under the water. There the wire, bending at a right angle,\\nentered the yawning gulf.\\n\\nCyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,--\\n\\n“In an hour the opening will be practicable.”\\n\\n“It is there, then?” said Pencroft.\\n\\n“Did you doubt it?” returned Harding.\\n\\n“But this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,”\\n observed Herbert.\\n\\n“Either the cavern will be completely dry,” replied Harding, “and in\\nthat case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be dry, and some\\nmeans of transport will be put at our disposal.”\\n\\nAn hour passed. All climbed down through the rain to the level of the\\nsea. There was now eight feet of the opening above the water. It was\\nlike the arch of a bridge, under which rushed the foaming water.\\n\\nLeaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the\\nwater. He drew it towards him. It was a boat, moored to some interior\\nprojection of the cave. This boat was iron-plated. Two oars lay at the\\nbottom.\\n\\n“Jump in!” said Harding.\\n\\nIn a moment the settlers were in the boat. Neb and Ayrton took the\\noars, Pencroft the rudder. Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the lantern,\\nlighted the way.\\n\\nThe elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed, suddenly\\nrose; but the darkness was too deep, and the light of the lantern too\\nslight, for either the extent, length, height, or depth of the cave to\\nbe ascertained. Solemn silence reigned in this basaltic cavern. Not a\\nsound could penetrate into it, even the thunder peals could not pierce\\nits thick sides.\\n\\nSuch immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural crypts\\ndating from the geological epoch of the globe. Some are filled by the\\nsea; others contain entire lakes in their sides. Such is Fingal’s Cave,\\nin the island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides; such are the caves of\\nMorgat, in the bay of Douarnenez, in Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio,\\nin Corsica, those of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such are the immense Mammoth\\ncaverns in Kentucky, 500 feet in height, and more than twenty miles in\\nlength! In many parts of the globe, nature has excavated these caverns,\\nand preserved them for the admiration of man.\\n\\nDid the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the\\ncenter of the island? For a quarter of an hour the boat had been\\nadvancing, making detours, indicated to Pencroft by the engineer in\\nshort sentences, when all at once,--\\n\\n“More to the right!” he commanded.\\n\\nThe boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall. The\\nengineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side.\\n\\nThe wire was there fastened to the rock.\\n\\n“Forward!” said Harding.\\n\\nAnd the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards.\\n\\nOn they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of\\nhalf-a-mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when\\nHarding’s voice was again heard.\\n\\n“Stop!” said he.\\n\\nThe boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light\\nilluminating the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of the\\nisland, of which nothing had ever led them to suspect the existence.\\n\\nAt a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported on basalt\\nshafts. Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on the columns\\nerected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of the formation of\\nthe globe. The basalt pillars, fitted one into the other, measured\\nfrom forty to fifty feet in height, and the water, calm in spite of the\\ntumult outside, washed their base. The brilliant focus of light, pointed\\nout by the engineer, touched every point of rocks, and flooded the walls\\nwith light.\\n\\nBy reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so that the\\nboat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones. They could\\nnot be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing\\nnucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles, all the\\nprojections of the cavern. This light proceeded from an electric source,\\nand its white color betrayed its origin. It was the sun of this cave,\\nand it filled it entirely.\\n\\nAt a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the water,\\ncausing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged forward towards\\nthe light, which was now not more than half a cable’s length distant.\\n\\nAt this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly 350\\nfeet, and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous basaltic\\nwall, blocking up any issue on that side. The cavern widened here\\nconsiderably, the sea forming a little lake. But the roof, the side\\nwalls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks, were flooded with\\nthe electric fluid, so that the brilliancy belonged to them, and as if\\nthe light issued from them.\\n\\nIn the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on the\\nsurface of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which issued\\nfrom it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a white heat.\\nThis apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale, was about 250\\nfeet long, and rose about ten or twelve above the water.\\n\\nThe boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the bows. He\\ngazed, a prey to violent excitement. Then, all at once, seizing the\\nreporter’s arm,--\\n\\n“It is he! It can only be he!” he cried, “he!--”\\n\\nThen, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon Spilett\\nalone could hear.\\n\\nThe reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful effect\\nupon him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,--\\n\\n“He! an outlawed man!”\\n\\n“He!” said Harding.\\n\\nAt the engineer’s command the boat approached this singular floating\\napparatus. The boat touched the left side, from which escaped a ray of\\nlight through a thick glass.\\n\\nHarding and his companions mounted on the platform. An open hatchway was\\nthere. All darted down the opening.\\n\\nAt the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity. At the\\nend of this deck was a door, which Harding opened.\\n\\nA richly-ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists, was joined\\nto a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light.\\n\\nAt the end of the library a large door, also shut, was opened by the\\nengineer.\\n\\nAn immense saloon--a sort of museum, in which were heaped up, with\\nall the treasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of\\nindustry--appeared before the eyes of the colonists, who almost thought\\nthemselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment.\\n\\nStretched on a rich sofa they saw a man, who did not appear to notice\\ntheir presence.\\n\\nThen Harding raised his voice, and to the extreme surprise of his\\ncompanions, he uttered these words,--\\n\\n“Captain Nemo, you asked for us! We are here.--”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\nAt these words the reclining figure rose, and the electric light fell\\nupon his countenance; a magnificent head, the forehead high, the glance\\ncommanding, beard white, hair abundant and falling over the shoulders.\\n\\nHis hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just\\nrisen. He appeared perfectly calm. It was evident that his strength had\\nbeen gradually undermined by illness, but his voice seemed yet powerful,\\nas he said in English, and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise,--\\n\\n“Sir, I have no name.”\\n\\n“Nevertheless, I know you!” replied Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer, as though he\\nwere about to annihilate him.\\n\\nThen, falling back amid the pillows of the divan,--\\n\\n“After all, what matters now?” he murmured; “I am dying!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his\\nhand--it was of a feverish heat. Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb\\nstood respectfully apart in an angle of the magnificent saloon, whose\\natmosphere was saturated with the electric fluid.\\n\\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the engineer and\\nthe reporter to be seated.\\n\\nAll regarded him with profound emotion. Before them they beheld that\\nbeing whom they had styled the “genius of the island,” the powerful\\nprotector whose intervention, in so many circumstances, had been so\\nefficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed such a debt of gratitude!\\nTheir eyes beheld a man only, and a man at the point of death, where\\nPencroft and Neb had expected to find an almost supernatural being!\\n\\nBut how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain Nemo? why\\nhad the latter so suddenly risen on hearing this name uttered, a name\\nwhich he had believed known to none?--\\n\\nThe captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning on his\\narm, he regarded the engineer, seated near him.\\n\\n“You know the name I formerly bore, sir?” he asked.\\n\\n“I do,” answered Cyrus Harding, “and also that of this wonderful\\nsubmarine vessel--”\\n\\n“The ‘Nautilus’?” said the captain, with a faint smile.\\n\\n“The ‘Nautilus.’”\\n\\n“But do you--do you know who I am?”\\n\\n“I do.”\\n\\n“It is nevertheless many years since I have held any communication with\\nthe inhabited world; three long years have I passed in the depth of\\nthe sea, the only place where I have found liberty! Who then can have\\nbetrayed my secret?”\\n\\n“A man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who,\\nconsequently, cannot be accused of treachery.”\\n\\n“The Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen years\\nsince?”\\n\\n“The same.”\\n\\n“He and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the\\nmidst of which the ‘Nautilus’ was struggling?”\\n\\n“They escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of ‘Twenty\\nThousand Leagues Under the Sea,’ which contains your history.”\\n\\n“The history of a few months only of my life!” interrupted the captain\\nimpetuously.\\n\\n“It is true,” answered Cyrus Harding, “but a few months of that strange\\nlife have sufficed to make you known.”\\n\\n“As a great criminal, doubtless!” said Captain Nemo, a haughty smile\\ncurling his lips. “Yes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against humanity!”\\n\\nThe engineer was silent.\\n\\n“Well, sir?”\\n\\n“It is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo,” answered Cyrus Harding,\\n“at any rate as regards your past life. I am, with the rest of the\\nworld, ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange\\nmode of existence, and I cannot judge of effects without knowing their\\ncauses; but what I do know is, that a beneficent hand has constantly\\nprotected us since our arrival on Lincoln Island, that we all owe our\\nlives to a good, generous, and powerful being, and that this being so\\npowerful, good and generous, Captain Nemo, is yourself!”\\n\\n“It is I,” answered the captain simply.\\n\\nThe engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn near, and\\nthe gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express\\nitself in their gestures and words.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which betrayed more\\nemotion than he doubtless intended to show.\\n\\n“Wait till you have heard all,” he said.\\n\\nAnd the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events of his\\nlife.\\n\\nHis narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his whole\\nremaining energy to arrive at the end. He was evidently contending\\nagainst extreme weakness. Several times Cyrus Harding entreated him to\\nrepose for a while, but he shook his head as a man to whom the morrow\\nmay never come, and when the reporter offered his assistance,--\\n\\n“It is useless,” he said; “my hours are numbered.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of the\\nthen independent territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him, when ten\\nyears of age, to Europe, in order that he might receive an education\\nin all respects complete, and in the hopes that by his talents and\\nknowledge he might one day take a leading part in raising his long\\ndegraded and heathen country to a level with the nations of Europe.\\n\\nFrom the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar, endowed by\\nNature with her richest gifts of intellect, accumulated knowledge of\\nevery kind, and in science, literature, and art his researches were\\nextensive and profound.\\n\\nHe traveled over the whole of Europe. His rank and fortune caused him to\\nbe everywhere sought after; but the pleasures of the world had for him\\nno attractions. Though young and possessed of every personal advantage,\\nhe was ever grave--somber even--devoured by an unquenchable thirst for\\nknowledge, and cherishing in the recesses of his heart the hope that\\nhe might become a great and powerful ruler of a free and enlightened\\npeople.\\n\\nStill, for long the love of science triumphed over all other feelings.\\nHe became an artist deeply impressed by the marvels of art, a\\nphilosopher to whom no one of the higher sciences was unknown, a\\nstatesman versed in the policy of European courts. To the eyes of those\\nwho observed him superficially he might have passed for one of those\\ncosmopolitans, curious of knowledge, but disdaining action; one of those\\nopulent travelers, haughty and cynical, who move incessantly from place\\nto place, and are of no country.\\n\\nThe history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under the title\\nof “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.” Here, therefore, will apply\\nthe observation already made as to the adventures of Ayrton with regard\\nto the discrepancy of dates. Readers should therefore refer to the note\\nalready published on this point.\\n\\nThis artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still cherishing\\nthe hope instilled into him from his earliest days.\\n\\nPrince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a\\nnoble Indian lady, who was imbued with an ambition not less ardent than\\nthat by which he was inspired. Two children were born to them, whom they\\ntenderly loved. But domestic happiness did not prevent him from seeking\\nto carry out the object at which he aimed. He waited an opportunity. At\\nlength, as he vainly fancied, it presented itself.\\n\\nInstigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and more\\nunscrupulous than he was, the people of India were persuaded that they\\nmight successfully rise against their English rulers, who had brought\\nthem out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and misery, and had\\nestablished peace and prosperity in their country. Their ignorance and\\ngross superstition made them the facile tools of their designing chiefs.\\n\\nIn 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out. Prince Dakkar, under the\\nbelief that he should thereby have the opportunity of attaining the\\nobject of his long-cherished ambition, was easily drawn into it. He\\nforthwith devoted his talents and wealth to the service of this cause.\\nHe aided it in person; he fought in the front ranks; he risked his life\\nequally with the humblest of the wretched and misguided fanatics; he was\\nten times wounded in twenty engagements, seeking death but finding it\\nnot, but at length the sanguinary rebels were utterly defeated, and the\\natrocious mutiny was brought to an end.\\n\\nNever before had the British power in India been exposed to such danger,\\nand if, as they had hoped, the sepoys had received assistance from\\nwithout, the influence and supremacy in Asia of the United Kingdom would\\nhave been a thing of the past.\\n\\nThe name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known. He had fought\\nopenly and without concealment. A price was set upon his head, but he\\nmanaged to escape from his pursuers.\\n\\nCivilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards.\\nThe sepoys were vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of old fell again\\nunder the rule of England.\\n\\nPrince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to the\\nmountain fastnesses of Bundelkund. There, alone in the world, overcome\\nby disappointment at the destruction of all his vain hopes, a prey\\nto profound disgust for all human beings, filled with hatred of the\\ncivilized world, he realized the wreck of his fortune, assembled some\\nscore of his most faithful companions, and one day disappeared, leaving\\nno trace behind.\\n\\nWhere, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited\\nearth? Under the waves, in the depths of the ocean, where none could\\nfollow.\\n\\nThe warrior became the man of science. Upon a deserted island of the\\nPacific he established his dockyard, and there a submarine vessel was\\nconstructed from his designs. By methods which will at some future\\nday be revealed he had rendered subservient the illimitable forces of\\nelectricity, which, extracted from inexhaustible sources, was employed\\nfor all the requirements of his floating equipage, as a moving,\\nlighting, and heating agent. The sea, with its countless treasures, its\\nmyriads of fish, its numberless wrecks, its enormous mammalia, and not\\nonly all that nature supplied, but also all that man had lost in its\\ndepths, sufficed for every want of the prince and his crew--and thus was\\nhis most ardent desire accomplished, never again to hold communication\\nwith the earth. He named his submarine vessel the “Nautilus,” called\\nhimself simply Captain Nemo, and disappeared beneath the seas.\\n\\nDuring many years this strange being visited every ocean, from pole to\\npole. Outcast of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered\\nincalculable treasures. The millions lost in the Bay of Vigo, in 1702,\\nby the galleons of Spain, furnished him with a mine of inexhaustible\\nriches which he devoted always, anonymously, in favor of those nations\\nwho fought for the independence of their country.\\n\\n  (This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were, in\\n   fact, largely assisted by Captain Nemo.)\\n\\nFor long, however, he had held no communication with his\\nfellow-creatures, when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866,\\nthree men were cast on board his vessel. They were a French professor,\\nhis servant, and a Canadian fisherman. These three men had been hurled\\noverboard by a collision which had taken place between the “Nautilus”\\n and the United States frigate “Abraham Lincoln,” which had chased her.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo learned from this professor that the “Nautilus,” taken now\\nfor a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel\\ncarrying a crew of pirates, was sought for in every sea.\\n\\nHe might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance\\nhad brought them in contact with his mysterious existence. Instead of\\ndoing this he kept them prisoners, and during seven months they were\\nenabled to behold all the wonders of a voyage of twenty thousand leagues\\nunder the sea.\\n\\nOne day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of\\nthe past history of Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping in one of the\\n“Nautilus’s” boats. But as at this time the “Nautilus” was drawn into\\nthe vortex of the maelstrom, off the coast of Norway, the captain\\nnaturally believed that the fugitives, engulfed in that frightful\\nwhirlpool, found their death at the bottom of the abyss. He was unaware\\nthat the Frenchman and his two companions had been miraculously cast\\non shore, that the fishermen of the Lofoten Islands had rendered\\nthem assistance, and that the professor, on his return to France, had\\npublished that work in which seven months of the strange and eventful\\nnavigation of the “Nautilus” were narrated and exposed to the curiosity\\nof the public.\\n\\nFor a long time after this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus,\\ntraversing every sea. But one by one his companions died, and found\\ntheir last resting-place in their cemetery of coral, in the bed of the\\nPacific. At last Captain Nemo remained the solitary survivor of all\\nthose who had taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean.\\n\\nHe was now sixty years of age. Although alone, he succeeded in\\nnavigating the “Nautilus” towards one of those submarine caverns which\\nhad sometimes served him as a harbor.\\n\\nOne of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at this\\nmoment furnished an asylum to the “Nautilus.”\\n\\nThe captain had now remained there six years, navigating the ocean no\\nlonger, but awaiting death, and that moment when he should rejoin his\\nformer companions, when by chance he observed the descent of the balloon\\nwhich carried the prisoners of the Confederates. Clad in his diving\\ndress he was walking beneath the water at a few cables’ length from the\\nshore of the island, when the engineer had been thrown into the sea.\\nMoved by a feeling of compassion the captain saved Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nHis first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five castaways;\\nbut his harbor refuge was closed, for in consequence of an elevation of\\nthe basalt, produced by the influence of volcanic action, he could\\nno longer pass through the entrance of the vault. Though there was\\nsufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar,\\nthere was not enough for the “Nautilus,” whose draught of water was\\nconsiderable.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain. He observed these men\\nthrown without resources upon a desert island, but had no wish to be\\nhimself discovered by them. By degrees he became interested in their\\nefforts when he saw them honest, energetic, and bound to each other by\\nthe ties of friendship. As if despite his wishes, he penetrated all the\\nsecrets of their existence. By means of the diving dress he could easily\\nreach the well in the interior of Granite House, and climbing by the\\nprojections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they\\nrecounted the past, and studied the present and future. He learned from\\nthem the tremendous conflict of America with America itself, for the\\nabolition of slavery. Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile Captain\\nNemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding. It was he also who had brought\\nback the dog to the Chimneys, who rescued Top from the waters of the\\nlake, who caused to fall at Flotsam Point the case containing so many\\nthings useful to the colonists, who conveyed the canoe back into the\\nstream of the Mercy, who cast the cord from the top of Granite House at\\nthe time of the attack by the baboons, who made known the presence\\nof Ayrton upon Tabor Island, by means of the document enclosed in the\\nbottle, who caused the explosion of the brig by the shock of a torpedo\\nplaced at the bottom of the canal, who saved Herbert from certain death\\nby bringing the sulphate of quinine; and finally, it was he who had\\nkilled the convicts with the electric balls, of which he possessed the\\nsecret, and which he employed in the chase of submarine creatures. Thus\\nwere explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences, and which\\nall proved the generosity and power of the captain.\\n\\nNevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his proteges\\nstill further. There yet remained much useful advice to give them, and,\\nhis heart being softened by the approach of death, he invited, as we are\\naware, the colonists of Granite House to visit the “Nautilus,” by means\\nof a wire which connected it with the corral. Possibly he would not\\nhave done this had he been aware that Cyrus Harding was sufficiently\\nacquainted with his history to address him by the name of Nemo.\\n\\nThe captain concluded the narrative of his life. Cyrus Harding then\\nspoke; he recalled all the incidents which had exercised so beneficent\\nan influence upon the colony, and in the names of his companions and\\nhimself thanked the generous being to whom they owed so much.\\n\\nBut Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be absorbed\\nby one idea, and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,--\\n\\n“Now, sir,” said he, “now that you know my history, your judgment!”\\n\\nIn saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important incident\\nwitnessed by the three strangers thrown on board his vessel, and which\\nthe French professor had related in his work, causing a profound and\\nterrible sensation. Some days previous to the flight of the professor\\nand his two companions, the “Nautilus,” being chased by a frigate in the\\nnorth of the Atlantic had hurled herself as a ram upon this frigate, and\\nsunk her without mercy.\\n\\nCyrus Harding understood the captain’s allusion, and was silent.\\n\\n“It was an enemy’s frigate,” exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed for\\nan instant into the Prince Dakkar, “an enemy’s frigate! It was she who\\nattacked me--I was in a narrow and shallow bay--the frigate barred my\\nway--and I sank her!”\\n\\nA few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,--\\n\\n“What think you of my life, gentlemen?”\\n\\nCyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and replied\\ngravely, “Sir, your error was in supposing that the past can be\\nresuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress. It is one\\nof those errors which some admire, others blame; which God alone can\\njudge. He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be\\nright may be an enemy, but retains our esteem. Your error is one that\\nwe may admire, and your name has nothing to fear from the judgment of\\nhistory, which does not condemn heroic folly, but its results.”\\n\\nThe old man’s breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to\\nheaven,--\\n\\n“Was I wrong, or in the right?” he murmured.\\n\\nCyrus Harding replied, “All great actions return to God, from whom they\\nare derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn\\nyour loss.”\\n\\nHerbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and kissed\\nhis hand.\\n\\nA tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man. “My child,” he said, “may\\nGod bless you!”\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\nDay had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the\\ncavern. It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the sea. But the\\nartificial light, which escaped in long streams from the skylights of\\nthe “Nautilus” was as vivid as before, and the sheet of water shone\\naround the floating vessel.\\n\\nAn extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen back\\nupon the divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to Granite\\nHouse, for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those\\nmarvels of the “Nautilus” which millions could not have purchased, and\\nto wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching.\\n\\nDuring a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost\\nunconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed\\nthe condition of the dying man. It was apparent that his strength was\\ngradually diminishing. That frame, once so robust, was now but the\\nfragile tenement of a departing soul. All of life was concentrated in\\nthe heart and head.\\n\\nThe engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible to\\nrender any aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved, be\\nprolonged for some days? He himself had said that no remedy could\\navail, and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had for him no\\nterrors.\\n\\n“We can do nothing,” said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“But of what is he dying?” asked Pencroft.\\n\\n“Life is simply fading out,” replied the reporter.\\n\\n“Nevertheless,” said the sailor, “if we move him into the open air, and\\nthe light of the sun, he might perhaps recover.”\\n\\n“No, Pencroft,” answered the engineer, “it is useless to attempt it.\\nBesides, Captain Nemo would never consent to leave his vessel. He\\nhas lived for a dozen years on board the ‘Nautilus,’ and on board the\\n‘Nautilus’ he desires to die.”\\n\\nWithout doubt Captain Nemo heard Cyrus Harding’s reply, for he raised\\nhimself slightly, and in a voice more feeble, but always intelligible,--\\n\\n“You are right, sir,” he said. “I shall die here--it is my wish; and\\ntherefore I have a request to make of you.”\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions had drawn near the divan, and now\\narranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying\\nman.\\n\\nThey saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon, lighted\\nby the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous\\nceiling. He surveyed, one after the other, the pictures hanging from\\nthe splendid tapestries of the partitions, the chef-d’oeuvres of the\\nItalian, Flemish, French, and Spanish masters; the statues of marble and\\nbronze on their pedestals; the magnificent organ, leaning against the\\nafter-partition; the aquarium, in which bloomed the most wonderful\\nproductions of the sea--marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls\\nof inestimable value; and, finally, his eyes rested on this device,\\ninscribed over the pediment of the museum--the motto of the “Nautilus”--\\n\\n\\n“Mobilis in mobile.”\\n\\n\\nHis glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces\\nof art and of nature, to which he had limited his horizon during a\\nsojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas.\\n\\nCyrus Harding respected the captain’s silence, and waited till he should\\nspeak.\\n\\nAfter some minutes, during which, doubtless, he passed in review his\\nwhole life, Captain Nemo turned to the colonists and said,\\n\\n“You consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to me?”\\n\\n“Captain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong yours.”\\n\\n“Promise, then,” continued Captain Nemo, “to carry out my last wishes,\\nand I shall be repaid for all I have done for you.”\\n\\n“We promise,” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nAnd by this promise he bound both himself and his companions.\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” resumed the captain, “to-morrow I shall be dead.”\\n\\nHerbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the captain\\narrested him.\\n\\n“To-morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the ‘Nautilus.’\\nIt is my grave! All my friends repose in the depths of the ocean; their\\nresting-place shall be mine.”\\n\\nThese words were received with profound silence.\\n\\n“Pay attention to my wishes,” he continued. “The ‘Nautilus’ is\\nimprisoned in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up; but,\\nalthough egress is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in the\\nabyss, and there bury my remains.”\\n\\nThe colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man.\\n\\n“To-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding,” continued the captain,\\n“yourself and companions will leave the ‘Nautilus,’ for all the\\ntreasures it contains must perish with me. One token alone will remain\\nwith you of Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now acquainted.\\nThat coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions,\\nmost of them mementoes of the time when, husband and father, I thought\\nhappiness possible for me, and a collection of pearls gathered by my\\nfriends and myself in the depths of the ocean. Of this treasure at a\\nfuture day, you may make good use. In the hands of such men as yourself\\nand your comrades, Captain Harding, money will never be a source of\\ndanger. From on high I shall still participate in your enterprises, and\\nI fear not but that they will prosper.”\\n\\nAfter a few moments’ repose, necessitated by his extreme weakness,\\nCaptain Nemo continued,--\\n\\n“To-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon, of which\\nyou will close the door; then you will ascend on to the deck of the\\n‘Nautilus,’ and you will lower the mainhatch so as entirely to close the\\nvessel.”\\n\\n“It shall be done, captain,” answered Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Good. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you hither; but,\\nbefore leaving the ‘Nautilus,’ go to the stern and there open two large\\nstop-cocks which you will find upon the water-line. The water will\\npenetrate into the reservoirs, and the ‘Nautilus’ will gradually sink\\nbeneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss.”\\n\\nAnd comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain added,--\\n\\n“Fear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!”\\n\\nNeither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any\\nobservation to Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and they\\nhad nothing to do but to conform to them.\\n\\n“I have your promise, gentlemen?” added Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“You have, captain,” replied the engineer.\\n\\nThe captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them to leave\\nhim for some hours. Gideon Spilett wished to remain near him, in the\\nevent of a crisis coming on, but the dying man refused, saying, “I shall\\nlive until to-morrow, sir.”\\n\\nAll left the saloon, passed through the library and the dining-room, and\\narrived forward, in the machine-room where the electrical apparatus was\\nestablished, which supplied not only heat and light, but the mechanical\\npower of the “Nautilus.”\\n\\nThe “Nautilus” was a masterpiece containing masterpieces within itself,\\nand the engineer was struck with astonishment.\\n\\nThe colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above\\nthe water. There they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering, which\\nprotected a kind of large eye, from which flashed forth light. Behind\\nthis eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder, and\\nin which was stationed the helmsman, when he navigated the “Nautilus”\\n over the bed of the ocean, which the electric rays would evidently light\\nup to a considerable distance.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for they\\nwere vividly impressed by what they had just seen and heard, and their\\nhearts were deeply touched by the thought that he whose arm had so often\\naided them, the protector whom they had known but a few hours, was at\\nthe point of death.\\n\\nWhatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events\\nof this, so to speak, extra-human existence, the character of Prince\\nDakkar would ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never\\nefface.\\n\\n“What a man!” said Pencroft. “Is it possible that he can have lived at\\nthe bottom of the sea? And it seems to me that perhaps he has not found\\npeace there any more than elsewhere!”\\n\\n“The ‘Nautilus,’” observed Ayrton, “might have enabled us to leave\\nLincoln Island and reach some inhabited country.”\\n\\n“Good Heavens!” exclaimed Pencroft, “I for one would never risk myself\\nin such a craft. To sail on the seas, good, but under the seas, never!”\\n\\n“I believe, Pencroft,” answered the reporter, “that the navigation of a\\nsubmarine vessel such as the ‘Nautilus’ ought to be very easy, and that\\nwe should soon become accustomed to it. There would be no storms, no\\nlee-shore to fear. At some feet beneath the surface the waters of the\\nocean are as calm as those of a lake.”\\n\\n“That may be,” replied the sailor, “but I prefer a gale of wind on\\nboard a well-found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea, and not\\nbeneath it.”\\n\\n“My friends,” said the engineer, “it is useless, at any rate as regards\\nthe ‘Nautilus,’ to discuss the question of submarine vessels. The\\n‘Nautilus’ is not ours, and we have not the right to dispose of it.\\nMoreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it. Independently of\\nthe fact that it would be impossible to get it out of this cavern, whose\\nentrance is now closed by the uprising of the basaltic rocks, Captain\\nNemo’s wish is that it shall be buried with him. His wish is our law,\\nand we will fulfil it.”\\n\\nAfter a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his\\ncompanions again descended to the interior of the “Nautilus.” There they\\ntook some refreshment and returned to the saloon.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had\\novercome him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint smile\\neven curled his lips.\\n\\nThe colonists drew around him.\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” said the captain, “you are brave and honest men. You\\nhave devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I observed\\nyour conduct. I have esteemed you--I esteem you still! Your hand, Mr.\\nHarding.”\\n\\nCyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it\\naffectionately.\\n\\n“It is well!” he murmured.\\n\\nHe resumed,--\\n\\n“But enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves, and this\\nLincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now desire to\\nleave it?”\\n\\n“To return, captain!” answered Pencroft quickly.\\n\\n“To return, Pencroft?” said the captain, with a smile. “I know, it is\\ntrue, your love for this island. You have helped to make it what it now\\nis, and it seems to you a paradise!”\\n\\n“Our project, captain,” interposed Cyrus Harding, “is to annex it to the\\nUnited States, and to establish for our shipping a port so fortunately\\nsituated in this part of the Pacific.”\\n\\n“Your thoughts are with your country, gentlemen,” continued the captain;\\n“your toils are for her prosperity and glory. You are right. One’s\\nnative land!--there should one live! there die! And I die far from all I\\nloved!”\\n\\n“You have some last wish to transmit,” said the engineer with emotion,\\n“some souvenir to send to those friends you have left in the mountains\\nof India?”\\n\\n“No, Captain Harding; no friends remain to me! I am the last of my race,\\nand to all whom I have known I have long been as are the dead.--But\\nto return to yourselves. Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and\\nbeyond human endurance. I die of having thought it possible to live\\nalone! You should, therefore, dare all in the attempt to leave Lincoln\\nIsland, and see once more the land of your birth. I am aware that those\\nwretches have destroyed the vessel you have built.”\\n\\n“We propose to construct a vessel,” said Gideon Spilett, “sufficiently\\nlarge to convey us to the nearest land; but if we should succeed, sooner\\nor later we shall return to Lincoln Island. We are attached to it by too\\nmany recollections ever to forget it.”\\n\\n“It is here that we have known Captain Nemo,” said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“It is here only that we can make our home!” added Herbert.\\n\\n“And here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity, if--” replied the\\ncaptain.\\n\\nHe paused for a moment, and, instead of completing the sentence, said\\nsimply,--\\n\\n“Mr. Harding, I wish to speak with you--alone!”\\n\\nThe engineer’s companions, respecting the wish, retired.\\n\\nCyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain Nemo, and\\nsoon recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them of the private\\nmatters which the dying man had confided to him.\\n\\nGideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was evident\\nthat he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which had lost the\\npower of reaction against his physical weakness.\\n\\nThe day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the “Nautilus”\\n for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible to distinguish\\nit from day in the cavern.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His noble\\nfeatures, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly calm. Inaudible\\nwords escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing upon various incidents\\nof his checkered career. Life was evidently ebbing slowly and his\\nextremities were already cold.\\n\\nOnce or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him, and\\nsmiled on them with that last smile which continues after death.\\n\\nAt length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme effort\\nsucceeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if wishing in that\\nattitude to compose himself for death.\\n\\nBy one o’clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying light\\ngleamed in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the words, “God\\nand my country!” he quietly expired.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the\\nPrince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo.\\n\\nHerbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton’s eyes. Neb\\nwas on his knees by the reporter’s side, motionless as a statue.\\n\\nThen Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the dead,\\nsaid solemnly, “May his soul be with God!” Turning to his friends, he\\nadded, “Let us pray for him whom we have lost!”\\n\\n\\nSome hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain\\nby carrying out his dying wishes.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions quitted the “Nautilus,” taking with\\nthem the only memento left them by their benefactor, the coffer which\\ncontained wealth amounting to millions.\\n\\nThe marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully\\nclosed. The iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in\\nsuch a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from penetrating to the\\ninterior of the “Nautilus.”\\n\\nThe colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to the\\nside of the submarine vessel.\\n\\nThe canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the water-line,\\nwere two large stop-cocks communicating with the reservoirs employed in\\nthe submersion of the vessel.\\n\\nThe stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the “Nautilus,”\\n slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the lake.\\n\\nBut the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves.\\nThe powerful light it gave forth lighted up the translucent water, while\\nthe cavern became gradually obscure. At length this vast effusion of\\nelectric light faded away, and soon after the “Nautilus,” now the tomb\\nof Captain Nemo, reposed in its ocean bed.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\n\\nAt break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the\\ncavern, to which they gave the name of “Dakkar Grotto,” in memory of\\nCaptain Nemo. It was now low-water, and they passed without difficulty\\nunder the arcade, washed on the right by the sea.\\n\\nThe canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As\\nadditional precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a little\\nbeach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a spot where it\\ncould run no risk of harm.\\n\\nThe storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings of the\\nthunder died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the sky was yet\\nobscured by clouds. On the whole, this month of October, the first of\\nthe southern spring, was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens, and the\\nwind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another,\\nwhich rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had taken\\nthe road to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were careful to\\npreserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the\\ncorral and the grotto, and which might at a future time be of service.\\n\\nThe colonists spoke but little on the road. The various incidents of the\\nnight of October 15th had left a profound impression on their minds. The\\nunknown being whose influence had so effectually protected them, the\\nman whom their imagination had endowed with supernatural powers, Captain\\nNemo, was no more. His “Nautilus” and he were buried in the depths of\\nthe abyss. To each one of them their existence seemed even more isolated\\nthan before. They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of\\nthat power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus\\nHarding, could not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a\\nprofound silence during their journey to the corral.\\n\\nTowards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite House.\\n\\nIt had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be\\nactively pushed forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted his\\ntime and labor to this object. It was impossible to divine what future\\nlay before them. Evidently the advantage to the colonists would be great\\nof having at their disposal a substantial vessel, capable of keeping the\\nsea even in heavy weather, and large enough to attempt, in case of\\nneed, a voyage of some duration. Even if, when their vessel should be\\ncompleted, the colonists should not resolve to leave Lincoln Island as\\nyet, in order to gain either one of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the\\nPacific or the shores of New Zealand, they might at least, sooner or\\nlater, proceed to Tabor Island, to leave there the notice relating to\\nAyrton. This was a precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility\\nof the Scotch yacht reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest\\nimportance that nothing should be neglected on this point.\\n\\nThe works were then resumed. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Ayrton,\\nassisted by Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when unavoidably\\ncalled off by other necessary occupations, worked without cessation. It\\nwas important that the new vessel should be ready in five months--that\\nis to say, by the beginning of March--if they wished to visit Tabor\\nIsland before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage impracticable.\\nTherefore the carpenters lost not a moment. Moreover, it was unnecessary\\nto manufacture rigging, that of the “Speedy” having been saved entire,\\nso that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed.\\n\\nThe end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important labors,\\nto the exclusion of almost all others. At the expiration of two months\\nand a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted. It\\nwas already evident that the plans made by Cyrus Harding were admirable,\\nand that the vessel would behave well at sea.\\n\\nPencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even grumble\\nwhen one or the other abandoned the carpenter’s axe for the gun of the\\nhunter. It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite\\nHouse, in view of the approaching winter. But this did not satisfy\\nPencroft. The brave, honest sailor was not content when the workmen were\\nnot at the dockyard. When this happened he grumbled vigorously, and, by\\nway of venting his feelings, did the work of six men.\\n\\nThe weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season.\\nFor some days the heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, saturated\\nwith electricity, was only cleared by violent storms. It was rarely that\\nthe distant growling of the thunder could not be heard, like a low but\\nincessant murmur, such as is produced in the equatorial regions of the\\nglobe.\\n\\nThe 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme violence,\\nand the thunder burst several times over the island. Large trees were\\nstruck by the electric fluid and shattered, and among others one of\\nthose gigantic nettle-trees which had shaded the poultry-yard at the\\nsouthern extremity of the lake. Had this meteor any relation to the\\nphenomena going on in the bowels of the earth? Was there any connection\\nbetween the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the\\nearth? Cyrus Harding was inclined to think that such was the case, for\\nthe development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic\\nsymptoms.\\n\\nIt was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at daybreak\\nto the plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the onagers,\\nperceived an enormous hat-shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the\\nvolcano.\\n\\nHerbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined him in\\nwatching the summit of Mount Franklin.\\n\\n“Ah!” exclaimed Pencroft, “those are not vapors this time! It seems to\\nme that the giant is not content with breathing; he must smoke!”\\n\\nThis figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed the\\nchanges going on at the mouth of the volcano. Already for three months\\nhad the crater emitted vapors more or less dense, but which were as yet\\nproduced only by an internal ebullition of mineral substances. But\\nnow the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke, rising in the form of a\\ngrayish column, more than three hundred feet in width at its base, and\\nwhich spread like an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight\\nhundred feet above the summit of the mountain.\\n\\n“The fire is in the chimney,” observed Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“And we can’t put it out!” replied Herbert.\\n\\n“The volcano ought to be swept,” observed Neb, who spoke as if perfectly\\nserious.\\n\\n“Well said, Neb!” cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; “and you’ll\\nundertake the job, no doubt?”\\n\\nCyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount\\nFranklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant\\nmuttering. Then, turning towards his companions, from whom he had gone\\nsomewhat apart, he said,--\\n\\n“The truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves that an\\nimportant change is going forward. The volcanic substances are no longer\\nin a state of ebullition, they have caught fire, and we are undoubtedly\\nmenaced by an approaching eruption.”\\n\\n“Well, captain,” said Pencroft, “we shall witness the eruption; and if\\nit is a good one, we’ll applaud it. I don’t see that we need concern\\nourselves further about the matter.”\\n\\n“It may be so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “for the ancient track of\\nthe lava is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto\\noverflowed towards the north. And yet--”\\n\\n“And yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it might be\\nbetter it should not take place,” said the reporter.\\n\\n“Who knows?” answered the sailor. “Perhaps there may be some valuable\\nsubstance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and which we may\\nturn to good account!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good\\nfrom the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden. He did not\\nregard so lightly as Pencroft the results of an eruption. If the lava,\\nin consequence of the position of the crater, did not directly menace\\nthe wooded and cultivated parts of the island, other complications might\\npresent themselves. In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied\\nby earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed of\\nsubstances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on\\nthe north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could\\nnot be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk\\nof disintegration. Although, therefore, the spreading of the volcanic\\nmatter might not constitute a serious danger, any movement of the\\nterrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail the\\ngravest consequences.\\n\\n“It seems to me,” said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place his ear\\nto the ground, “it seems to me that I can hear a dull, rumbling sound,\\nlike that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron.”\\n\\nThe colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were convinced\\nthat Ayrton was not mistaken. The rumbling was mingled with a\\nsubterranean roar, which formed a sort of rinforzando, and died slowly\\naway, as if some violent storm had passed through the profundities of\\nthe globe. But no explosion properly so termed, could be heard. It might\\ntherefore be concluded that the vapors and smoke found a free passage\\nthrough the central shaft; and that the safety-valve being sufficiently\\nlarge, no convulsion would be produced, no explosion was to be\\napprehended.\\n\\n“Well, then!” said Pencroft, “are we not going back to work? Let Mount\\nFranklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame as much as\\nit pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle! Come, Ayrton, Neb,\\nHerbert, Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one of us must turn to at\\nour work to-day! We are going to place the keelson, and a dozen pair\\nof hands would not be too many. Before two months I want our new\\n‘Bonadventure’--for we shall keep the old name, shall we not?--to float\\non the waters of Port Balloon! Therefore there is not an hour to lose!”\\n\\nAll the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by Pencroft,\\ndescended to the dockyard, and proceeded to place the keelson, a thick\\nmass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly\\nthe timbers of the hull. It was an arduous undertaking, in which all\\ntook part.\\n\\nThey continued their labors during the whole of this day, the 3rd of\\nJanuary, without thinking further of the volcano, which could not,\\nbesides, be seen from the shore of Granite House. But once or twice,\\nlarge shadows, veiling the sun, which described its diurnal arc through\\nan extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick cloud of smoke passed\\nbetween its disc and the island. The wind, blowing on the shore, carried\\nall these vapors to the westward. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett\\nremarked these somber appearances, and from time to time discussed\\nthe evident progress of the volcanic phenomena, but their work went\\non without interruption. It was, besides, of the first importance from\\nevery point of view, that the vessel should be finished with the least\\npossible delay. In presence of the eventualities which might arise,\\nthe safety of the colonists would be to a great extent secured by their\\nship. Who could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge?\\n\\nIn the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert\\nagain ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. It was already dark, and\\nthe obscurity would permit them to ascertain if flames or incandescent\\nmatter thrown up by the volcano were mingled with the vapor and smoke\\naccumulated at the mouth of the crater.\\n\\n“The crater is on fire!” said Herbert, who, more active than his\\ncompanion, first reached the plateau.\\n\\nMount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a gigantic\\ntorch, around the summit of which turned fuliginous flames. So much\\nsmoke, and possibly scoriae and cinders were mingled with them, that\\ntheir light gleamed but faintly amid the gloom of the night. But a kind\\nof lurid brilliancy spread over the island, against which stood out\\nconfusedly the wooded masses of the heights. Immense whirlwinds of vapor\\nobscured the sky, through which glimmered a few stars.\\n\\n“The change is rapid!” said the engineer.\\n\\n“That is not surprising,” answered the reporter. “The reawakening of the\\nvolcano already dates back some time. You may remember, Cyrus, that\\nthe first vapors appeared about the time we searched the sides of the\\nmountain to discover Captain Nemo’s retreat. It was, if I mistake not,\\nabout the 15th of October.”\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Herbert, “two months and a half ago!”\\n\\n“The subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten weeks,”\\n resumed Gideon Spilett, “and it is not to be wondered at that they now\\nbreak out with such violence!”\\n\\n“Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?” asked Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Yes,” replied Gideon Spilett, “but there is a great difference between\\nthat and an earthquake.”\\n\\n“I do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,” answered Cyrus\\nHarding, “may God preserve us from that! No; these vibrations are due to\\nthe effervescence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is\\nsimply the shell of a boiler, and you know that such a shell, under the\\npressure of steam, vibrates like a sonorous plate. It is this effect\\nwhich is being produced at this moment.”\\n\\n“What magnificent flames!” exclaimed Herbert.\\n\\nAt this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater,\\nthe brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors. Thousands\\nof luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various\\ndirections. Some, extending beyond the dome of smoke, dissipated\\nit, leaving behind an incandescent powder. This was accompanied\\nby successive explosions, resembling the discharge of a battery of\\nmachine-guns.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour on the\\nplateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach, and returned\\nto Granite House. The engineer was thoughtful and preoccupied, so much\\nso, indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he apprehended any immediate\\ndanger, of which the eruption might directly or indirectly be the cause.\\n\\n“Yes, and no,” answered Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“Nevertheless,” continued the reporter, “would not the greatest\\nmisfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would\\noverturn the island? Now, I do not suppose that this is to be feared,\\nsince the vapors and lava have found a free outlet.”\\n\\n“True,” replied Cyrus Harding, “and I do not fear an earthquake in the\\nsense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil\\nprovoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But other causes may\\nproduce great disasters.”\\n\\n“How so, my dear Cyrus?’\\n\\n“I am not certain. I must consider. I must visit the mountain. In a few\\ndays I shall learn more on this point.”\\n\\nGideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the explosions of\\nthe volcano, whose intensity increased, and which were repeated by the\\nechoes of the island, the inhabitants of Granite House were sleeping\\nsoundly.\\n\\nThree days passed by--the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January. The construction\\nof the vessel was diligently continued, and without offering further\\nexplanations the engineer pushed forward the work with all his energy.\\nMount Franklin was now hooded by a somber cloud of sinister aspect, and,\\namid the flames, vomiting forth incandescent rocks, some of which fell\\nback into the crater itself. This caused Pencroft, who would only look\\nat the matter in the light of a joke, to exclaim,--\\n\\n“Ah! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a conjurer.”\\n\\nIn fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss, and\\nit did not seem that the lava, though swollen by the internal pressure,\\nhad yet risen to the orifice of the crater. At any rate, the opening on\\nthe northeast, which was partly visible, poured out no torrent upon the\\nnorthern slope of the mountain.\\n\\nNevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the vessel, other\\nduties demanded the presence of the colonists on various portions of the\\nisland. Before everything it was necessary to go to the corral, where\\nthe flocks of musmons and goats were enclosed, and replenish the\\nprovision of forage for those animals. It was accordingly arranged that\\nAyrton should proceed thither the next day, the 7th of January; and as\\nhe was sufficient for the task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft and\\nthe rest were somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton--\\n\\n“As you are going to-morrow to the corral I will accompany you.”\\n\\n“But, Captain Harding,” exclaimed the sailor, “our working days will not\\nbe many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands short!”\\n\\n“We shall return to-morrow,” replied Cyrus Harding, “but it is necessary\\nthat I should go to the corral. I must learn how the eruption is\\nprogressing.”\\n\\n“The eruption! always the eruption!” answered Pencroft, with an air of\\ndiscontent. “An important thing, truly, this eruption! I trouble myself\\nvery little about it.”\\n\\nWhatever might be the sailor’s opinion, the expedition projected by the\\nengineer was settled for the next day. Herbert wished to accompany Cyrus\\nHarding, but he would not vex Pencroft by his absence.\\n\\nThe next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the cart drawn\\nby two onagers, took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot.\\n\\nAbove the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater of Mount\\nFranklin incessantly added fuliginous matter. These clouds, which rolled\\nheavily in the air, were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances.\\nIt was not alone from the volcano that they derived their strange\\nopacity and weight. Scoriae, in a state of dust, like powdered\\npumice-stone, and grayish ashes as small as the finest feculae, were\\nheld in suspension in the midst of their thick folds. These ashes are so\\nfine that they have been observed in the air for whole months. After\\nthe eruption of 1783 in Iceland for upwards of a year the atmosphere was\\nthus charged with volcanic dust through which the rays of the sun were\\nonly with difficulty discernible.\\n\\nBut more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened on the\\npresent occasion. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely reached the\\ncorral when a sort of black snow like fine gunpowder fell, and instantly\\nchanged the appearance of the soil. Trees, meadows, all disappeared\\nbeneath a covering several inches in depth. But, very fortunately,\\nthe wind blew from the northeast, and the greater part of the cloud\\ndissolved itself over the sea.\\n\\n“This is very singular, Captain Harding,” said Ayrton.\\n\\n“It is very serious,” replied the engineer. “This powdered pumice-stone,\\nall this mineral dust, proves how grave is the convulsion going forward\\nin the lower depths of the volcano.”\\n\\n“But can nothing be done?”\\n\\n“Nothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon. Do you,\\ntherefore, Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the\\ncorral. In the meantime I will ascend just beyond the source of Red\\nCreek and examine the condition of the mountain upon its northern\\naspect. Then--”\\n\\n“Well, Captain Harding?”\\n\\n“Then we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto. I wish to inspect it. At any\\nrate I will come back for you in two hours.”\\n\\nAyrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting the\\nengineer’s return, busied himself with the musmons and goats which\\nseemed to feel a certain uneasiness in presence of these first signs of\\nan eruption.\\n\\nMeanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur, passed\\nRed Creek, and arrived at the spot where he and his companions had\\ndiscovered a sulphurous spring at the time of their first exploration.\\n\\nHow changed was everything! Instead of a single column of smoke he\\ncounted thirteen, forced through the soil as if violently propelled by\\nsome piston. It was evident that the crust of the earth was subjected\\nin this part of the globe to a frightful pressure. The atmosphere was\\nsaturated with gases and carbonic acid, mingled with aqueous vapors.\\nCyrus Harding felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn,\\nand which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time,\\ntremble beneath him, but he could discover no traces of fresh lava.\\n\\nThe engineer became more assured of this when he observed all the\\nnorthern part of Mount Franklin. Pillars of smoke and flame escaped from\\nthe crater; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground; but no current of\\nlava burst from the mouth of the volcano, which proved that the volcanic\\nmatter had not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the\\ncentral shaft.\\n\\n“But I would prefer that it were so,” said Cyrus Harding to himself. “At\\nany rate, I should then know that the lava had followed its accustomed\\ntrack. Who can say that it may not take a new course? But the danger\\ndoes not consist in that! Captain Nemo foresaw it clearly! No, the\\ndanger does not lie there!”\\n\\nCyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose prolongation\\nenclosed the narrow Shark Gulf. He could now sufficiently examine on\\nthis side the ancient channels of the lava. There was no doubt in his\\nmind that the most recent eruption had occurred at a far-distant epoch.\\n\\nHe then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the\\nsubterranean mutterings which rolled like long-continued thunder,\\ninterrupted by deafening explosions. At nine in the morning he reached\\nthe corral.\\n\\nAyrton awaited him.\\n\\n“The animals are cared for, Captain Harding,” said Ayrton.\\n\\n“Good, Ayrton.”\\n\\n“They seem uneasy, Captain Harding.”\\n\\n“Yes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never deceived.”\\n\\n“Are you ready?”\\n\\n“Take a lamp, Ayrton,” answered the engineer; “we will start at once.”\\n\\nAyrton did as desired. The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the corral.\\nThe gate was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding, preceding\\nAyrton, took the narrow path which led westward to the shore.\\n\\nThe soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter fallen\\nfrom the cloud. No quadruped appeared in the woods. Even the birds had\\nfled. Sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of ashes, and the\\ntwo colonists, enveloped in a whirlwind of dust, lost sight of each\\nother. They were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with\\nhandkerchiefs, for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated.\\n\\nIt was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these impediments,\\nto make rapid progress. Moreover, the atmosphere was close, as if the\\noxygen had been partly burned up, and had become unfit for respiration.\\nAt every hundred paces they were obliged to stop to take breath. It was\\ntherefore past ten o’clock when the engineer and his companion reached\\nthe crest of the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which\\ncomposed the northwest coast of the island.\\n\\nAyrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity,\\nfollowing almost step for step the difficult path which, during that\\nstormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto. In open day the descent was\\nless perilous, and, besides, the bed of ashes which covered the polished\\nsurface of the rock enabled them to make their footing more secure.\\n\\nThe ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height, was soon\\nreached. Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation gradually sloped\\ntowards the level of the sea. Although the tide was at present low, no\\nbeach could be seen, and the waves, thickened by the volcanic dust, beat\\nupon the basaltic rocks.\\n\\nCyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance to Dakkar\\nGrotto, and paused for a moment at the last rock before it.\\n\\n“The iron boat should be there,” said the engineer.\\n\\n“It is here, Captain Harding,” replied Ayrton, drawing towards him the\\nfragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the vault.\\n\\n“On board, Ayrton!”\\n\\nThe two colonists stepped into the boat. A slight undulation of the\\nwaves carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and there\\nAyrton, with the aid of flint and steel, lighted the lamp. He then took\\nthe oars, and the lamp having been placed in the bow of the boat, so\\nthat its rays fell before them, Cyrus Harding took the helm and steered\\nthrough the shades of the grotto.\\n\\nThe “Nautilus” was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its\\nelectric light. Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but no ray\\nescaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was\\nmortal of Captain Nemo.\\n\\nThe light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless enabled\\nthe engineer to advance slowly, following the wall of the cavern. A\\ndeathlike silence reigned under the vaulted roof, or at least in the\\nanterior portion, for soon Cyrus Harding distinctly heard the rumbling\\nwhich proceeded from the bowels of the mountain.\\n\\n“That comes from the volcano,” he said.\\n\\nBesides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon\\nbetrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were\\nalmost suffocated by sulphurous vapors.\\n\\n“This is what Captain Nemo feared,” murmured Cyrus Harding, changing\\ncountenance. “We must go to the end, notwithstanding.”\\n\\n“Forward!” replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the boat\\ntowards the head of the cavern.\\n\\nTwenty-five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the boat\\nreached the extreme end.\\n\\nCyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon the\\nwalls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the\\nvolcano. What was the thickness of this wall? It might be ten feet or a\\nhundred feet--it was impossible to say. But the subterranean sounds were\\ntoo perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great\\nthickness.\\n\\nThe engineer, after having explored the wall at a certain height\\nhorizontally, fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again surveyed\\nthe basaltic wall at a greater elevation.\\n\\nThere, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a pungent\\nvapor, which infected the atmosphere of the cavern. The wall was broken\\nby large cracks, some of which extended to within two or three feet of\\nthe water’s edge.\\n\\nCyrus Harding thought for a brief space. Then he said in a low voice,--\\n\\n“Yes! the captain was right! The danger lies there, and a terrible\\ndanger!”\\n\\nAyrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding, resumed the\\noars, and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of\\nDakkar Grotto.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\nThe next day, the 8th day of January, after a day and night passed\\nat the corral, where they left all in order, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton\\narrived at Granite House.\\n\\nThe engineer immediately called his companions together, and informed\\nthem of the imminent danger which threatened Lincoln Island, and from\\nwhich no human power could deliver them.\\n\\n“My friends,” he said, and his voice betrayed the depth of his emotion,\\n“our island is not among those which will endure while this earth\\nendures. It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction, the cause of\\nwhich it bears within itself, and from which nothing can save it.”\\n\\nThe colonists looked at each other, then at the engineer. They did not\\nclearly comprehend him.\\n\\n“Explain yourself, Cyrus!” said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“I will do so,” replied Cyrus Harding, “or rather I will simply\\nafford you the explanation which, during our few minutes of private\\nconversation, was given me by Captain Nemo.”\\n\\n“Captain Nemo!” exclaimed the colonists.\\n\\n“Yes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before his\\ndeath!”\\n\\n“The last service!” exclaimed Pencroft, “the last service! You will see\\nthat though he is dead he will render us others yet!”\\n\\n“But what did the captain say?” inquired the reporter.\\n\\n“I will tell you, my friends,” said the engineer. “Lincoln Island does\\nnot resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a fact of which\\nCaptain Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or later bring about the\\nsubversion of its foundation.”\\n\\n“Nonsense! Lincoln Island, it can’t be!” cried Pencroft, who, in spite\\nof the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a gesture of\\nincredulity.\\n\\n“Listen, Pencroft,” resumed the engineer, “I will tell you what Captain\\nNemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed yesterday, during\\nthe exploration of Dakkar Grotto.\\n\\n“This cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano, and is\\nonly separated from its central shaft by the wall which terminates it.\\nNow, this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow\\nthe sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to\\nescape.”\\n\\n“Well?” said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting.\\n\\n“Well, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal pressure\\nfrom within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving way and that\\nafter a longer or shorter period it will afford a passage to the waters\\nof the lake which fill the cavern.”\\n\\n“Good!” replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. “The sea will\\nextinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the matter!”\\n\\n“Not so!” said Cyrus Harding, “should a day arrive when the sea, rushing\\nthrough the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central shaft into the\\ninterior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln Island will that day\\nbe blown into the air--just as would happen to the island of Sicily were\\nthe Mediterranean to precipitate itself into Mount Etna.”\\n\\nThe colonists made no answer to these significant words of the engineer.\\nThey now understood the danger by which they were menaced.\\n\\nIt may be added that Cyrus Harding had in no way exaggerated the danger\\nto be apprehended. Many persons have formed an idea that it would be\\npossible to extinguish volcanoes, which are almost always situated on\\nthe shores of a sea or lake, by opening a passage for the admission of\\nthe water. But they are not aware that this would be to incur the risk\\nof blowing up a portion of the globe, like a boiler whose steam is\\nsuddenly expanded by intense heat. The water, rushing into a cavity\\nwhose temperature might be estimated at thousands of degrees, would\\nbe converted into steam with a sudden energy which no enclosure could\\nresist.\\n\\nIt was not therefore doubtful that the island, menaced by a frightful\\nand approaching convulsion, would endure only so long as the wall\\nof Dakkar Grotto itself should endure. It was not even a question of\\nmonths, nor of weeks, but of days; it might be of hours.\\n\\nThe first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound\\nsorrow. They thought not so much of the peril which menaced themselves\\npersonally, but of the destruction of the island which had sheltered\\nthem, which they had cultivated, which they loved so well, and had hoped\\nto render so flourishing. So much effort ineffectually expended, so much\\nlabor lost.\\n\\nPencroft could not prevent a large tear from rolling down his cheek, nor\\ndid he attempt to conceal it.\\n\\nSome further conversation now took place. The chances yet in favor of\\nthe colonists were discussed; but finally it was agreed that there was\\nnot an hour to be lost, that the building and fitting of the vessel\\nshould be pushed forward with their utmost energy, and that this was the\\nsole chance of safety for the inhabitants of Lincoln Island.\\n\\nAll hands, therefore, set to work on the vessel. What could it avail\\nto sow, to reap, to hunt, to increase the stores of Granite House?\\nThe contents of the storehouse and outbuildings contained more than\\nsufficient to provide the ship for a voyage, however long might be its\\nduration. But it was imperative that the ship should be ready to receive\\nthem before the inevitable catastrophe should arrive.\\n\\nTheir labors were now carried on with feverish ardor. By the 23rd of\\nJanuary the vessel was half-decked over. Up to this time no change had\\ntaken place on the summit of the volcano. Vapor and smoke mingled with\\nflames and incandescent stones were thrown up from the crater. But\\nduring the night of the 23rd, in consequence of the lava attaining the\\nlevel of the first stratum of the volcano, the hat-shaped cone which\\nformed over the latter disappeared. A frightful sound was heard. The\\ncolonists at first thought the island was rent asunder, and rushed out\\nof Granite House.\\n\\nThis occurred about two o’clock in the morning.\\n\\nThe sky appeared on fire. The superior cone, a mass of rock a thousand\\nfeet in height, and weighing thousands of millions of pounds, had\\nbeen thrown down upon the island, making it tremble to its foundation.\\nFortunately, this cone inclined to the north, and had fallen upon the\\nplain of sand and tufa stretching between the volcano and the sea. The\\naperture of the crater being thus enlarged projected towards the sky a\\nglare so intense that by the simple effect of reflection the atmosphere\\nappeared red-hot. At the same time a torrent of lava, bursting from the\\nnew summit, poured out in long cascades, like water escaping from a vase\\ntoo full, and a thousand tongues of fire crept over the sides of the\\nvolcano.\\n\\n“The corral! the corral!” exclaimed Ayrton.\\n\\nIt was, in fact, towards the corral that the lava was rushing as the\\nnew crater faced the east, and consequently the fertile portions of the\\nisland, the springs of Red Creek and Jacamar Wood, were menaced with\\ninstant destruction.\\n\\nAt Ayrton’s cry the colonists rushed to the onagers’ stables. The cart\\nwas at once harnessed. All were possessed by the same thought--to hasten\\nto the corral and set at liberty the animals it enclosed.\\n\\nBefore three in the morning they arrived at the corral. The cries of the\\nterrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them.\\nAlready a torrent of burning matter and liquefied minerals fell from\\nthe side of the mountain upon the meadows as far as the side of the\\npalisade. The gate was burst open by Ayrton, and the animals, bewildered\\nwith terror, fled in all directions.\\n\\nAn hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral, converting into\\nvapor the water of the little rivulet which ran through it, burning up\\nthe house like dry grass, and leaving not even a post of the palisade to\\nmark the spot where the corral once stood.\\n\\nTo contend against this disaster would have been folly--nay, madness. In\\npresence of Nature’s grand convulsions man is powerless.\\n\\nIt was now daylight--the 24th of January. Cyrus Harding and his\\ncompanions, before returning to Granite House, desired to ascertain the\\nprobable direction this inundation of lava was about to take. The soil\\nsloped gradually from Mount Franklin to the east coast, and it was to be\\nfeared that, in spite of the thick Jacamar Wood, the torrent would reach\\nthe plateau of Prospect Heights.\\n\\n“The lake will cover us,” said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“I hope so!” was Cyrus Harding’s only reply.\\n\\nThe colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the\\nsuperior cone of Mount Franklin had fallen, but the lava arrested their\\nprogress. It had followed, on one side, the valley of Red Creek, and\\non the other that of Falls River, evaporating those watercourses in its\\npassage. There was no possibility of crossing the torrent of lava;\\non the contrary, the colonists were obliged to retreat before it. The\\nvolcano, without its crown, was no longer recognizable, terminated as it\\nwas by a sort of flat table which replaced the ancient crater. From two\\nopenings in its southern and eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava\\npoured forth, thus forming two distinct streams. Above the new crater a\\ncloud of smoke and ashes, mingled with those of the atmosphere, massed\\nover the island. Loud peals of thunder broke, and could scarcely be\\ndistinguished from the rumblings of the mountain, whose mouth vomited\\nforth ignited rocks, which, hurled to more than a thousand feet, burst\\nin the air like shells. Flashes of lightning rivaled in intensity the\\nvolcano’s eruption.\\n\\nTowards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable by the\\ncolonists, who accordingly took shelter in the borders of Jacamar Wood.\\nNot only did the projectiles begin to rain around them, but the lava,\\noverflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to cut off the road to the\\ncorral. The nearest rows of trees caught fire, and their sap, suddenly\\ntransformed into vapor, caused them to explode with loud reports, while\\nothers, less moist, remained unhurt in the midst of the inundation.\\n\\nThe colonists had again taken the road to the corral. They proceeded but\\nslowly, frequently looking back; but, in consequence of the inclination\\nof the soil, the lava gained rapidly in the east, and as its lower waves\\nbecame solidified others, at boiling heat, covered them immediately.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more and\\nmore menacing. All this portion of the forest was on fire, and enormous\\nwreaths of smoke rolled over the trees, whose trunks were already\\nconsumed by the lava.\\n\\nThe colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the mouth of\\nRed Creek. A question of life or death was now to be decided.\\n\\nCyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important crises, and\\naware that he was addressing men capable of hearing the truth, whatever\\nit might be, then said,--\\n\\n“Either the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a part of\\nthe island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the stream will\\noverrun the forests of the Far West, and not a tree or plant will\\nremain on the surface of the soil. We shall have no prospect but that\\nof starvation upon these barren rocks--a death which will probably be\\nanticipated by the explosion of the island.”\\n\\n“In that case,” replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping his\\nfoot, “what’s the use of working any longer on the vessel?”\\n\\n“Pencroft,” answered Cyrus Harding, “we must do our duty to the last!”\\n\\nAt this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage through\\nthe noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the borders of the\\nlake. At this point there was an elevation of the soil which, had it\\nbeen greater, might have sufficed to arrest the torrent.\\n\\n“To work!” cried Cyrus Harding.\\n\\nThe engineer’s thought was at once understood. It might be possible to\\ndam, as it were, the torrent, and thus compel it to pour itself into the\\nlake.\\n\\nThe colonists hastened to the dockyard. They returned with shovels,\\npicks, axes, and by means of banking the earth with the aid of fallen\\ntrees they succeeded in a few hours in raising an embankment three feet\\nhigh and some hundreds of paces in length. It seemed to them, when\\nthey had finished, as if they had scarcely been working more than a few\\nminutes.\\n\\nIt was not a moment too soon. The liquefied substances soon after\\nreached the bottom of the barrier. The stream of lava swelled like a\\nriver about to overflow its banks, and threatened to demolish the sole\\nobstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole Far West. But\\nthe dam held firm, and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent\\nprecipitated itself into Grant Lake from a height of twenty feet.\\n\\nThe colonists, without moving or uttering a word, breathlessly regarded\\nthis strife of the two elements.\\n\\nWhat a spectacle was this conflict between water and fire! What pen\\ncould describe the marvelous horror of this scene--what pencil could\\ndepict it? The water hissed as it evaporated by contact with the boiling\\nlava. The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable height, as if\\nthe valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened. But, however\\nconsiderable might be the volume of water contained in the lake, it must\\neventually be absorbed, because it was not replenished, while the stream\\nof lava, fed from an inexhaustible source, rolled on without ceasing new\\nwaves of incandescent matter.\\n\\nThe first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately solidified\\nand accumulated so as speedily to emerge from it. Upon their surface\\nfell other waves, which in their turn became stone, but a step\\nnearer the center of the lake. In this manner was formed a pier which\\nthreatened to gradually fill up the lake, which could not overflow, the\\nwater displaced by the lava being evaporated. The hissing of the water\\nrent the air with a deafening sound, and the vapor, blown by the wind,\\nfell in rain upon the sea. The pier became longer and longer, and the\\nblocks of lava piled themselves one on another. Where formerly stretched\\nthe calm waters of the lake now appeared an enormous mass of smoking\\nrocks, as if an upheaving of the soil had formed immense shoals. Imagine\\nthe waters of the lake aroused by a hurricane, then suddenly solidified\\nby an intense frost, and some conception may be formed of the aspect of\\nthe lake three hours after the eruption of this irresistible torrent of\\nlava.\\n\\nThis time water would be vanquished by fire.\\n\\nNevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the\\neffusion of lava should have been in the direction of Lake Grant. They\\nhad before them some days’ respite. The plateau of Prospect Heights,\\nGranite House, and the dockyard were for the moment preserved. And these\\nfew days it was necessary to employ in planking and carefully calking\\nthe vessel, and launching her. The colonists would then take refuge on\\nboard the vessel, content to rig her after she should be afloat on the\\nwaters. With the danger of an explosion which threatened to destroy the\\nisland there could be no security on shore. The walls of Granite House,\\nonce so sure a retreat, might at any moment fall in upon them.\\n\\nDuring the six following days, from the 25th to the 30th of January, the\\ncolonists accomplished as much of the construction of their vessel as\\ntwenty men could have done. They hardly allowed themselves a moment’s\\nrepose, and the glare of the flames which shot from the crater enabled\\nthem to work night and day. The flow of lava continued, but perhaps\\nless abundantly. This was fortunate, for Lake Grant was almost entirely\\nchoked up, and if more lava should accumulate it would inevitably spread\\nover the plateau of Prospect Heights, and thence upon the beach.\\n\\nBut if the island was thus partially protected on this side, it was not\\nso with the western part.\\n\\nIn fact, the second stream of lava, which had followed the valley of\\nFalls River, a valley of great extent, the land on both sides of the\\ncreek being flat, met with no obstacle. The burning liquid had then\\nspread through the forest of the Far West. At this period of the year,\\nwhen the trees were dried up by a tropical heat, the forest caught fire\\ninstantaneously, in such a manner that the conflagration extended itself\\nboth by the trunks of the trees and by their higher branches, whose\\ninterlacement favored its progress. It even appeared that the current\\nof flame spread more rapidly among the summits of the trees than the\\ncurrent of lava at their bases.\\n\\nThus it happened that the wild animals, jaguars, wild boars, capybaras,\\nkoalas, and game of every kind, mad with terror, had fled to the banks\\nof the Mercy and to the Tadorn Marsh, beyond the road to Port Balloon.\\nBut the colonists were too much occupied with their task to pay any\\nattention to even the most formidable of these animals. They had\\nabandoned Granite House, and would not even take shelter at the\\nChimneys, but encamped under a tent, near the mouth of the Mercy.\\n\\nEach day Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ascended the plateau of\\nProspect Heights. Sometimes Herbert accompanied them, but never\\nPencroft, who could not bear to look upon the prospect of the island now\\nso utterly devastated.\\n\\nIt was, in truth, a heart-rending spectacle. All the wooded part of the\\nisland was now completely bare. One single clump of green trees raised\\ntheir heads at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula. Here and there\\nwere a few grotesque blackened and branchless stumps. The side of the\\ndevastated forest was even more barren than Tadorn Marsh. The eruption\\nof lava had been complete. Where formerly sprang up that charming\\nverdure, the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of volcanic tufa.\\nIn the valleys of the Falls and Mercy rivers no drop of water now\\nflowed towards the sea, and should Lake Grant be entirely dried up,\\nthe colonists would have no means of quenching their thirst. But,\\nfortunately the lava had spared the southern corner of the lake,\\ncontaining all that remained of the drinking water of the island.\\nTowards the northwest stood out the rugged and well-defined outlines of\\nthe sides of the volcano, like a gigantic claw hovering over the island.\\nWhat a sad and fearful sight, and how painful to the colonists, who,\\nfrom a fertile domain covered with forests, irrigated by watercourses,\\nand enriched by the produce of their toils, found themselves, as it\\nwere, transported to a desolate rock, upon which, but for their reserves\\nof provisions, they could not even gather the means of subsistence!\\n\\n“It is enough to break one’s heart!” said Gideon Spilett, one day.\\n\\n“Yes, Spilett,” answered the engineer. “May God grant us the time to\\ncomplete this vessel, now our sole refuge!”\\n\\n“Do not you think, Cyrus, that the violence of the eruption has somewhat\\nlessened? The volcano still vomits forth lava, but somewhat less\\nabundantly, if I mistake not.”\\n\\n“It matters little,” answered Cyrus Harding. “The fire is still burning\\nin the interior of the mountain, and the sea may break in at any moment.\\nWe are in the condition of passengers whose ship is devoured by a\\nconflagration which they cannot extinguish, and who know that sooner or\\nlater the flames must reach the powder-magazine. To work, Spilett, to\\nwork, and let us not lose an hour!”\\n\\nDuring eight days more, that is to say until the 7th of February,\\nthe lava continued to flow, but the eruption was confined within the\\nprevious limits. Cyrus Harding feared above all lest the liquefied\\nmatter should overflow the shore, for in that event the dockyard could\\nnot escape. Moreover, about this time the colonists felt in the frame of\\nthe island vibrations which alarmed them to the highest degree.\\n\\nIt was the 20th of February. Yet another month must elapse before the\\nvessel would be ready for sea. Would the island hold together till then?\\nThe intention of Pencroft and Cyrus Harding was to launch the vessel\\nas soon as the hull should be complete. The deck, the upperworks, the\\ninterior woodwork and the rigging might be finished afterwards, but the\\nessential point was that the colonists should have an assured refuge\\naway from the island. Perhaps it might be even better to conduct the\\nvessel to Port Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the\\ncenter of eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and\\nthe wall of granite, it would run the risk of being crushed in the event\\nof any convulsion. All the exertions of the voyagers were therefore\\nconcentrated upon the completion of the hull.\\n\\nThus the 3rd of March arrived, and they might calculate upon launching\\nthe vessel in ten days.\\n\\nHope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this fourth\\nyear of their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many trials. Even\\nPencroft lost in some measure the somber taciturnity occasioned by\\nthe devastation and ruin of his domain. His hopes, it is true, were\\nconcentrated upon his vessel.\\n\\n“We shall finish it,” he said to the engineer, “we shall finish it,\\ncaptain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the equinox\\nwill soon be here. Well, if necessary, we must put in to Tabor island\\nto spend the winter. But think of Tabor island after Lincoln Island. Ah,\\nhow unfortunate! Who could have believed it possible?”\\n\\n“Let us get on,” was the engineer’s invariable reply.\\n\\nAnd they worked away without losing a moment.\\n\\n“Master,” asked Neb, a few days later, “do you think all this could have\\nhappened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?”\\n\\n“Certainly, Neb,” answered Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n“I, for one, don’t believe it!” whispered Pencroft to Neb.\\n\\n“Nor I!” answered Neb seriously.\\n\\nDuring the first week of March appearances again became menacing.\\nThousands of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava, fell like rain\\nupon the island. The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed\\nthe back of the volcano. The torrent flowed along the surface of the\\nhardened tufa, and destroyed the few meager skeletons of trees which had\\nwithstood the first eruption. The stream, flowing this time towards the\\nsouthwest shore of Lake Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine, and\\ninvaded the plateau of Prospect Heights. This last blow to the work of\\nthe colonists was terrible. The mill, the buildings of the inner court,\\nthe stables, were all destroyed. The affrighted poultry fled in all\\ndirections. Top and Jup showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their\\ninstinct warned them of an impending catastrophe. A large number of the\\nanimals of the island had perished in the first eruption. Those which\\nsurvived found no refuge but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to which the\\nplateau of Prospect Heights afforded asylum. But even this last retreat\\nwas now closed to them, and the lava-torrent, flowing over the edge of\\nthe granite wall, began to pour down upon the beach its cataracts of\\nfire. The sublime horror of this spectacle passed all description.\\nDuring the night it could only be compared to a Niagara of molten fluid,\\nwith its incandescent vapors above and its boiling masses below.\\n\\nThe colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and although the\\nupper seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they decided to launch\\nher at once.\\n\\nPencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary preparations for\\nthe launching, which was to take place the morning of the next day, the\\n9th of March.\\n\\nBut during the night of the 8th an enormous column of vapor escaping\\nfrom the crater rose with frightful explosions to a height of more than\\nthree thousand feet. The wall of Dakkar Grotto had evidently given way\\nunder the pressure of gases, and the sea, rushing through the central\\nshaft into the igneous gulf, was at once converted into vapor. But\\nthe crater could not afford a sufficient outlet for this vapor. An\\nexplosion, which might have been heard at a distance of a hundred miles,\\nshook the air. Fragments of mountains fell into the Pacific, and, in a\\nfew minutes, the ocean rolled over the spot where Lincoln island once\\nstood.\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\nAn isolated rock, thirty feet in length, twenty in breadth, scarcely ten\\nfrom the water’s edge, such was the only solid point which the waves of\\nthe Pacific had not engulfed.\\n\\nIt was all that remained of the structure of Granite House! The wall had\\nfallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments, and a few of the\\nrocks of the large room were piled one above another to form this point.\\nAll around had disappeared in the abyss; the inferior cone of Mount\\nFranklin, rent asunder by the explosion; the lava jaws of Shark Gulf,\\nthe plateau of Prospect Heights, Safety Islet, the granite rocks of Port\\nBalloon, the basalts of Dakkar Grotto, the long Serpentine Peninsula, so\\ndistant nevertheless from the center of the eruption. All that could\\nnow be seen of Lincoln Island was the narrow rock which now served as a\\nrefuge to the six colonists and their dog Top.\\n\\nThe animals had also perished in the catastrophe; the birds, as well\\nas those representing the fauna of the island--all either crushed or\\ndrowned, and the unfortunate Jup himself had, alas! found his death in\\nsome crevice of the soil.\\n\\nIf Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton\\nhad survived, it was because, assembled under their tent, they had been\\nhurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island\\nrained down on every side.\\n\\nWhen they reached the surface they could only perceive, at half a\\ncable’s length, this mass of rocks, towards which they swam and on which\\nthey found footing.\\n\\nOn this barren rock they had now existed for nine days. A few provisions\\ntaken from the magazine of Granite House before the catastrophe, a\\nlittle fresh water from the rain which had fallen in a hollow of the\\nrock, was all that the unfortunate colonists possessed. Their last hope,\\nthe vessel, had been shattered to pieces. They had no means of quitting\\nthe reef; no fire, nor any means of obtaining it. It seemed that they\\nmust inevitably perish.\\n\\nThis day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for two\\ndays, although they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries\\nof life. All their science and intelligence could avail them nothing in\\ntheir present position. They were in the hand of God.\\n\\nCyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and Pencroft, a\\nprey to sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock. Herbert did not\\nfor a moment quit the engineer’s side, as if demanding from him that\\nassistance he had no power to give. Neb and Ayrton were resigned to\\ntheir fate.\\n\\n“Ah, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!” often repeated Pencroft.\\n“If we had but a walnut-shell to take us to Tabor Island! But we have\\nnothing, nothing!”\\n\\n“Captain Nemo did right to die,” said Neb.\\n\\nDuring the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate\\ncompanions husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care, eating\\nonly what would prevent them from dying of starvation. Their weakness\\nwas extreme. Herbert and Neb began to show symptoms of delirium.\\n\\nUnder these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the\\nshadow of a hope? No! What was their sole remaining chance? That a\\nvessel should appear in sight of the rock? But they knew only too well\\nfrom experience that no ships ever visited this part of the Pacific.\\nCould they calculate that, by a truly providential coincidence, the\\nScotch yacht would arrive precisely at this time in search of Ayrton\\nat Tabor Island? It was scarcely probable; and, besides, supposing\\nshe should come there, as the colonists had not been able to deposit\\na notice pointing out Ayrton’s change of abode, the commander of the\\nyacht, after having explored Tabor Island without results, would again\\nset sail and return to lower latitudes.\\n\\nNo! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible death,\\ndeath from hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this rock.\\n\\nAlready they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no longer\\nconscious of what passed around them. Ayrton alone, by a supreme effort,\\nfrom time to time raised his head, and cast a despairing glance over the\\ndesert ocean.\\n\\nBut on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton’s arms were extended\\ntoward a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first on his knees,\\nthen upright, and his hand seemed to make a signal.\\n\\nA sail was in sight off the rock. She was evidently not without an\\nobject. The reef was the mark for which she was making in a direct line,\\nunder all steam, and the unfortunate colonists might have made her out\\nsome hours before if they had had the strength to watch the horizon.\\n\\n“The ‘Duncan’!” murmured Ayrton--and fell back without sign of life.\\n\\nWhen Cyrus Harding and his companions recovered consciousness, thanks to\\nthe attention lavished upon them, they found themselves in the cabin of\\na steamer, without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death.\\n\\nA word from Ayrton explained everything.\\n\\n“The ‘Duncan’!” he murmured.\\n\\n“The ‘Duncan’!” exclaimed Cyrus Harding. And raising his hand to Heaven,\\nhe said, “Oh! Almighty God! mercifully hast Thou preserved us!”\\n\\nIt was, in fact, the “Duncan,” Lord Glenarvan’s yacht, now commanded by\\nRobert, son of Captain Grant, who had been despatched to Tabor Island to\\nfind Ayrton, and bring him back to his native land after twelve years of\\nexpiation.\\n\\nThe colonists were not only saved, but already on the way to their\\nnative country.\\n\\n“Captain Grant,” asked Cyrus Harding, “who can have suggested to you the\\nidea, after having left Tabor Island, where you did not find Ayrton, of\\ncoming a hundred miles farther northeast?”\\n\\n“Captain Harding,” replied Robert Grant, “it was in order to find, not\\nonly Ayrton, but yourself and your companions.”\\n\\n“My companions and myself?”\\n\\n“Doubtless, at Lincoln Island.”\\n\\n“At Lincoln Island!” exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb,\\nand Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished.\\n\\n“How could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?” inquired\\nCyrus Harding, “it is not even named in the charts.”\\n\\n“I knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island,” answered\\nRobert Grant.\\n\\n“A document!” cried Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n“Without doubt, and here it is,” answered Robert Grant, producing a\\npaper which indicated the longitude and latitude of Lincoln Island, “the\\npresent residence of Ayrton and five American colonists.”\\n\\n“It is Captain Nemo!” cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the notice,\\nand recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of the paper\\nfound at the corral.\\n\\n“Ah!” said Pencroft, “it was then he who took our ‘Bonadventure’ and\\nhazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!”\\n\\n“In order to leave this notice,” added Herbert.\\n\\n“I was then right in saying,” exclaimed the sailor, “that even after his\\ndeath the captain would render us a last service.”\\n\\n“My friends,” said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest emotion,\\n“may the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain Nemo, our\\nbenefactor.”\\n\\nThe colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus Harding,\\nand murmured the name of Captain Nemo.\\n\\nThen Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, “Where should this\\ncoffer be deposited?”\\n\\nIt was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his life, at\\nthe very instant that the island had been engulfed, and which he now\\nfaithfully handed to the engineer.\\n\\n“Ayrton! Ayrton!” said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched. Then, addressing\\nRobert Grant, “Sir,” he added, “you left behind you a criminal; you find\\nin his place a man who has become honest by penitence, and whose hand I\\nam proud to clasp in mine.”\\n\\nRobert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of Captain\\nNemo and the colonists of Lincoln Island. Then, observation being taken\\nof what remained of this shoal, which must henceforward figure on the\\ncharts of the Pacific, the order was given to make all sail.\\n\\nA few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and found their\\ncountry once more at peace after the terrible conflict in which right\\nand justice had triumphed.\\n\\nOf the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to the\\ncolonists of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in the\\npurchase of a vast territory in the State of Iowa. One pearl alone, the\\nfinest, was reserved from the treasure and sent to Lady Glenarvan in the\\nname of the castaways restored to their country by the “Duncan.”\\n\\nThere, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is to say,\\nto wealth and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped to offer the\\nhospitality of Lincoln Island. There was founded a vast colony to\\nwhich they gave the name of that island sunk beneath the waters of the\\nPacific. A river there was called the Mercy, a mountain took the name\\nof Mount Franklin, a small lake was named Lake Grant, and the forests\\nbecame the forests of the Far West. It might have been an island on\\nterra firma.\\n\\nThere, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions,\\neverything prospered. Not one of the former colonists of Lincoln Island\\nwas absent, for they had sworn to live always together. Neb was with his\\nmaster; Ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft\\nwas more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor; Herbert, who completed\\nhis studies under the superintendence of Cyrus Harding, and Gideon\\nSpilett, who founded the New Lincoln Herald, the best-informed journal\\nin the world.\\n\\nThere Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals visits from\\nLord and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his wife, the sister\\nof Robert Grant, Robert Grant himself, Major McNab, and all those who\\nhad taken part in the history both of Captain Grant and Captain Nemo.\\n\\nThere, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as they had\\nbeen in the past; but never could they forget that island upon which\\nthey had arrived poor and friendless, that island which, during four\\nyears had supplied all their wants, and of which there remained but a\\nfragment of granite washed by the waves of the Pacific, the tomb of him\\nwho had borne the name of Captain Nemo.\\n\\nA JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH\\n\\nBy Jules Verne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Redactor\\'s Note: Journey to the Centre of the Earth is number\\nV002 in the Taves and Michaluk numbering of the works of Jules\\nVerne.

They were\\ntruly so wonderful that even now I am bewildered when I think of them.\\n\\nMy uncle was a German, having married my mother\\'s sister, an\\nEnglishwoman. Being very much attached to his fatherless nephew, he\\ninvited me to study under him in his home in the fatherland. This home\\nwas in a large town, and my uncle a professor of philosophy, chemistry,\\ngeology, mineralogy, and many other ologies.\\n\\nOne day, after passing some hours in the laboratory--my uncle being\\nabsent at the time--I suddenly felt the necessity of renovating the\\ntissues--<i>i.e.</i>, I was hungry, and was about to rouse up our old French\\ncook, when my uncle, Professor Von Hardwigg, suddenly opened the street\\ndoor, and came rushing upstairs.\\n\\nNow Professor Hardwigg, my worthy uncle, is by no means a bad sort of\\nman; he is, however, choleric and original. To bear with him means to\\nobey; and scarcely had his heavy feet resounded within our joint\\ndomicile than he shouted for me to attend upon him.\\n\\n\"Harry--Harry--Harry--\"\\n\\nI hastened to obey, but before I could reach his room, jumping three\\nsteps at a time, he was stamping his right foot upon the landing.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" he cried, in a frantic tone, \"are you coming up?\"\\n\\nNow to tell the truth, at that moment I was far more interested in the\\nquestion as to what was to constitute our dinner than in any problem of\\nscience; to me soup was more interesting than soda, an omelette more\\ntempting than arithmetic, and an artichoke of ten times more value than\\nany amount of asbestos.\\n\\nBut my uncle was not a man to be kept waiting; so adjourning therefore\\nall minor questions, I presented myself before him.\\n\\nHe was a very learned man. Now most persons in this category supply\\nthemselves with information, as peddlers do with goods, for the benefit\\nof others, and lay up stores in order to diffuse them abroad for the\\nbenefit of society in general. Not so my excellent uncle, Professor\\nHardwigg; he studied, he consumed the midnight oil, he pored over heavy\\ntomes, and digested huge quartos and folios in order to keep the\\nknowledge acquired to himself.\\n\\nThere was a reason, and it may be regarded as a good one, why my uncle\\nobjected to display his learning more than was absolutely necessary: he\\nstammered; and when intent upon explaining the phenomena of the heavens,\\nwas apt to find himself at fault, and allude in such a vague way to sun,\\nmoon, and stars that few were able to comprehend his meaning. To tell\\nthe honest truth, when the right word would not come, it was generally\\nreplaced by a very powerful adjective.\\n\\nIn connection with the sciences there are many almost unpronounceable\\nnames--names very much resembling those of Welsh villages; and my uncle\\nbeing very fond of using them, his habit of stammering was not thereby\\nimproved. In fact, there were periods in his discourse when he would\\nfinally give up and swallow his discomfiture--in a glass of water.\\n\\nAs I said, my uncle, Professor Hardwigg, was a very learned man; and I\\nnow add a most kind relative. I was bound to him by the double ties of\\naffection and interest. I took deep interest in all his doings, and\\nhoped some day to be almost as learned myself. It was a rare thing for\\nme to be absent from his lectures. Like him, I preferred mineralogy to\\nall the other sciences. My anxiety was to gain real <i>knowledge of the\\nearth</i>. Geology and mineralogy were to us the sole objects of life, and\\nin connection with these studies many a fair specimen of stone, chalk,\\nor metal did we break with our hammers.\\n\\nSteel rods, loadstones, glass pipes, and bottles of various acids were\\noftener before us than our meals. My uncle Hardwigg was once known to\\nclassify six hundred different geological specimens by their weight,\\nhardness, fusibility, sound, taste, and smell.\\n\\nHe corresponded with all the great, learned, and scientific men of the\\nage. I was, therefore, in constant communication with, at all events the\\nletters of, Sir Humphry Davy, Captain Franklin, and other great men.\\n\\nBut before I state the subject on which my uncle wished to confer with\\nme, I must say a word about his personal appearance. Alas! my readers\\nwill see a very different portrait of him at a future time, after he has\\ngone through the fearful adventures yet to be related.\\n\\nMy uncle was fifty years old; tall, thin, and wiry. Large spectacles\\nhid, to a certain extent, his vast, round, and goggle eyes, while his\\nnose was irreverently compared to a thin file. So much indeed did it\\nresemble that useful article, that a compass was said in his presence to\\nhave made considerable N (Nasal) deviation.\\n\\nThe truth being told, however, the only article really attracted to my\\nuncle\\'s nose was tobacco.\\n\\nAnother peculiarity of his was, that he always stepped a yard at a time,\\nclenched his fists as if he were going to hit you, and was, when in one\\nof his peculiar humors, very far from a pleasant companion.\\n\\nIt is further necessary to observe that he lived in a very nice house,\\nin that very nice street, the Konigstrasse at Hamburg. Though lying in\\nthe centre of a town, it was perfectly rural in its aspect--half wood,\\nhalf bricks, with old-fashioned gables--one of the few old houses spared\\nby the great fire of 1842.\\n\\nWhen I say a nice house, I mean a handsome house--old, tottering, and\\nnot exactly comfortable to English notions: a house a little off the\\nperpendicular and inclined to fall into the neighboring canal; exactly\\nthe house for a wandering artist to depict; all the more that you could\\nscarcely see it for ivy and a magnificent old tree which grew over the\\ndoor.\\n\\nMy uncle was rich; his house was his own property, while he had a\\nconsiderable private income. To my notion the best part of his\\npossessions was his god-daughter, Gretchen. And the old cook, the young\\nlady, the Professor and I were the sole inhabitants.\\n\\nI loved mineralogy, I loved geology. To me there was nothing like\\npebbles--and if my uncle had been in a little less of a fury, we should\\nhave been the happiest of families. To prove the excellent Hardwigg\\'s\\nimpatience, I solemnly declare that when the flowers in the drawing-room\\npots began to grow, he rose every morning at four o\\'clock to make them\\ngrow quicker by pulling the leaves!\\n\\nHaving described my uncle, I will now give an account of our interview.\\n\\nHe received me in his study; a perfect museum, containing every natural\\ncuriosity that can well be imagined--minerals, however, predominating.\\nEvery one was familiar to me, having been catalogued by my own hand. My\\nuncle, apparently oblivious of the fact that he had summoned me to his\\npresence, was absorbed in a book. He was particularly fond of early\\neditions, tall copies, and unique works.\\n\\n\"Wonderful!\" he cried, tapping his forehead. \"Wonderful--wonderful!\"\\n\\nIt was one of those yellow-leaved volumes now rarely found on stalls,\\nand to me it appeared to possess but little value. My uncle, however,\\nwas in raptures.\\n\\nHe admired its binding, the clearness of its characters, the ease with\\nwhich it opened in his hand, and repeated aloud, half a dozen times,\\nthat it was very, very old.\\n\\nTo my fancy he was making a great fuss about nothing, but it was not my\\nprovince to say so. On the contrary, I professed considerable interest\\nin the subject, and asked him what it was about.\\n\\n\"It is the Heims-Kringla of Snorre Tarleson,\" he said, \"the celebrated\\nIcelandic author of the twelfth century--it is a true and correct\\naccount of the Norwegian princes who reigned in Iceland.\"\\n\\nMy next question related to the language in which it was written. I\\nhoped at all events it was translated into German. My uncle was\\nindignant at the very thought, and declared he wouldn\\'t give a penny for\\na translation. His delight was to have found the original work in the\\nIcelandic tongue, which he declared to be one of the most magnificent\\nand yet simple idioms in the world--while at the same time its\\ngrammatical combinations were the most varied known to students.\\n\\n\"About as easy as German?\" was my insidious remark.\\n\\nMy uncle shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"The letters at all events,\" I said, \"are rather difficult of\\ncomprehension.\"\\n\\n\"It is a Runic manuscript, the language of the original population of\\nIceland, invented by Odin himself,\" cried my uncle, angry at my\\nignorance.\\n\\nI was about to venture upon some misplaced joke on the subject, when a\\nsmall scrap of parchment fell out of the leaves. Like a hungry man\\nsnatching at a morsel of bread the Professor seized it. It was about\\nfive inches by three and was scrawled over in the most extraordinary\\nfashion.\\n\\nThe lines shown here are an exact facsimile of what was written on the\\nvenerable piece of parchment--and have wonderful importance, as they\\ninduced my uncle to undertake the most wonderful series of adventures\\nwhich ever fell to the lot of human beings.\\n\\nMy uncle looked keenly at the document for some moments and then\\ndeclared that it was Runic. The letters were similar to those in the\\nbook, but then what did they mean? This was exactly what I wanted to\\nknow.\\n\\nNow as I had a strong conviction that the Runic alphabet and dialect\\nwere simply an invention to mystify poor human nature, I was delighted\\nto find that my uncle knew as much about the matter as I did--which was\\nnothing. At all events the tremulous motion of his fingers made me think\\nso.\\n\\n\"And yet,\" he muttered to himself, \"it is old Icelandic, I am sure of\\nit.\"\\n\\nAnd my uncle ought to have known, for he was a perfect polyglot\\ndictionary in himself. He did not pretend, like a certain learned\\npundit, to speak the two thousand languages and four thousand idioms\\nmade use of in different parts of the globe, but he did know all the\\nmore important ones.\\n\\nIt is a matter of great doubt to me now, to what violent measures my\\nuncle\\'s impetuosity might have led him, had not the clock struck two,\\nand our old French cook called out to let us know that dinner was on the\\ntable.\\n\\n\"Bother the dinner!\" cried my uncle.\\n\\nBut as I was hungry, I sallied forth to the dining room, where I took up\\nmy usual quarters. Out of politeness I waited three minutes, but no sign\\nof my uncle, the Professor. I was surprised. He was not usually so blind\\nto the pleasure of a good dinner. It was the acme of German\\nluxury--parsley soup, a ham omelette with sorrel trimmings, an oyster of\\nveal stewed with prunes, delicious fruit, and sparkling Moselle. For the\\nsake of poring over this musty old piece of parchment, my uncle forbore\\nto share our meal. To satisfy my conscience, I ate for both.\\n\\nThe old cook and housekeeper was nearly out of her mind. After taking so\\nmuch trouble, to find her master not appear at dinner was to her a sad\\ndisappointment--which, as she occasionally watched the havoc I was\\nmaking on the viands, became also alarm. If my uncle were to come to\\ntable after all?\\n\\nSuddenly, just as I had consumed the last apple and drunk the last glass\\nof wine, a terrible voice was heard at no great distance. It was my\\nuncle roaring for me to come to him. I made very nearly one leap of\\nit--so loud, so fierce was his tone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\nTHE MYSTERIOUS PARCHMENT\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: Runic Glyphs]\\n\\n\"I Declare,\" cried my uncle, striking the table fiercely with his fist,\\n\"I declare to you it is Runic--and contains some wonderful secret, which\\nI must get at, at any price.\"\\n\\nI was about to reply when he stopped me.\\n\\n\"Sit down,\" he said, quite fiercely, \"and write to my dictation.\"\\n\\nI obeyed.\\n\\n\"I will substitute,\" he said, \"a letter of our alphabet for that of the\\nRunic: we will then see what that will produce. Now, begin and make no\\nmistakes.\"\\n\\nThe dictation commenced with the following incomprehensible result:\\n\\n\\n     mm.rnlls esruel seecJde\\n     sgtssmf unteief niedrke\\n     kt,samn atrateS Saodrrn\\n     emtnaeI nuaect  rrilSa\\n     Atvaar  .nscrc  ieaabs\\n     ccdrmi  eeutul  frantu\\n     dt,iac  oseibo  KediiY\\n\\n\\nScarcely giving me time to finish, my uncle snatched the document from\\nmy hands and examined it with the most rapt and deep attention.\\n\\n\"I should like to know what it means,\" he said, after a long period.\\n\\nI certainly could not tell him, nor did he expect me to--his\\nconversation being uniformly answered by himself.\\n\\n\"I declare it puts me in mind of a cryptograph,\" he cried, \"unless,\\nindeed, the letters have been written without any real meaning; and yet\\nwhy take so much trouble? Who knows but I may be on the verge of some\\ngreat discovery?\"\\n\\nMy candid opinion was that it was all rubbish! But this opinion I kept\\ncarefully to myself, as my uncle\\'s choler was not pleasant to bear. All\\nthis time he was comparing the book with the parchment.\\n\\n\"The manuscript volume and the smaller document are written in different\\nhands,\" he said, \"the cryptograph is of much later date than the book;\\nthere is an undoubted proof of the correctness of my surmise. [An\\nirrefragable proof I took it to be.] The first letter is a double M,\\nwhich was only added to the Icelandic language in the twelfth\\ncentury--this makes the parchment two hundred years posterior to the\\nvolume.\"\\n\\nThe circumstances appeared very probable and very logical, but it was\\nall surmise to me.\\n\\n\"To me it appears probable that this sentence was written by some owner\\nof the book. Now who was the owner, is the next important question.\\nPerhaps by great good luck it may be written somewhere in the volume.\"\\n\\nWith these words Professor Hardwigg took off his spectacles, and, taking\\na powerful magnifying glass, examined the book carefully.\\n\\nOn the fly leaf was what appeared to be a blot of ink, but on\\nexamination proved to be a line of writing almost effaced by time. This\\nwas what he sought; and, after some considerable time, he made out these\\nletters:\\n\\n[Illustration: Runic Glyphs]\\n\\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" he cried in a joyous and triumphant tone, \"that is\\nnot only an Icelandic name, but of a learned professor of the sixteenth\\ncentury, a celebrated alchemist.\"\\n\\nI bowed as a sign of respect.\\n\\n\"These alchemists,\" he continued, \"Avicenna, Bacon, Lully, Paracelsus,\\nwere the true, the only learned men of the day. They made surprising\\ndiscoveries. May not this Saknussemm, nephew mine, have hidden on this\\nbit of parchment some astounding invention? I believe the cryptograph to\\nhave a profound meaning--which I must make out.\"\\n\\nMy uncle walked about the room in a state of excitement almost\\nimpossible to describe.\\n\\n\"It may be so, sir,\" I timidly observed, \"but why conceal it from\\nposterity, if it be a useful, a worthy discovery?\"\\n\\n\"Why--how should I know? Did not Galileo make a secret of his\\ndiscoveries in connection with Saturn? But we shall see. Until I\\ndiscover the meaning of this sentence I will neither eat nor sleep.\"\\n\\n\"My dear uncle--\" I began.\\n\\n\"Nor you neither,\" he added.\\n\\nIt was lucky I had taken double allowance that day.\\n\\n\"In the first place,\" he continued, \"there must be a clue to the\\nmeaning. If we could find that, the rest would be easy enough.\"\\n\\nI began seriously to reflect. The prospect of going without food and\\nsleep was not a promising one, so I determined to do my best to solve\\nthe mystery. My uncle, meanwhile, went on with his soliloquy.\\n\\n\"The way to discover it is easy enough. In this document there are one\\nhundred and thirty-two letters, giving seventy-nine consonants to\\nfifty-three vowels. This is about the proportion found in most southern\\nlanguages, the idioms of the north being much more rich in consonants.\\nWe may confidently predict, therefore, that we have to deal with a\\nsouthern dialect.\"\\n\\nNothing could be more logical.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Professor Hardwigg, \"to trace the particular language.\"\\n\\n\"As Shakespeare says, \\'that is the question,\"\\' was my rather satirical\\nreply.\\n\\n\"This man Saknussemm,\" he continued, \"was a very learned man: now as he\\ndid not write in the language of his birthplace, he probably, like most\\nlearned men of the sixteenth century, wrote in Latin. If, however, I\\nprove wrong in this guess, we must try Spanish, French, Italian, Greek,\\nand even Hebrew. My own opinion, though, is decidedly in favor of\\nLatin.\"\\n\\nThis proposition startled me. Latin was my favorite study, and it seemed\\nsacrilege to believe this gibberish to belong to the country of Virgil.\\n\\n\"Barbarous Latin, in all probability,\" continued my uncle, \"but still\\nLatin.\"\\n\\n\"Very probably,\" I replied, not to contradict him.\\n\\n\"Let us see into the matter,\" continued my uncle; \"here you see we have\\na series of one hundred and thirty-two letters, apparently thrown\\npell-mell upon paper, without method or organization. There are words\\nwhich are composed wholly of consonants, such as <i>mm.rnlls</i>, others\\nwhich are nearly all vowels, the fifth, for instance, which is unteief,\\nand one of the last oseibo. This appears an extraordinary combination.\\nProbably we shall find that the phrase is arranged according to some\\nmathematical plan. No doubt a certain sentence has been written out and\\nthen jumbled up--some plan to which some figure is the clue. Now, Harry,\\nto show your English wit--what is that figure?\"\\n\\nI could give him no hint. My thoughts were indeed far away. While he was\\nspeaking I had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin Gretchen, and\\nwas wondering when she would return.\\n\\nWe were affianced, and loved one another very sincerely. But my uncle,\\nwho never thought even of such sublunary matters, knew nothing of this.\\nWithout noticing my abstraction, the Professor began reading the\\npuzzling cryptograph all sorts of ways, according to some theory of his\\nown. Presently, rousing my wandering attention, he dictated one precious\\nattempt to me.\\n\\nI mildly handed it over to him. It read as follows:\\n\\n\\n    <i>mmessunkaSenrA.icefdoK.segnittamurtn\\n    ecertserrette,rotaivsadua,ednecsedsadne\\n    lacartniiilrJsiratracSarbmutabiledmek\\n    meretarcsilucoYsleffenSnI.</i>\\n\\n\\nI could scarcely keep from laughing, while my uncle, on the contrary,\\ngot in a towering passion, struck the table with his fist, darted out of\\nthe room, out of the house, and then taking to his heels was presently\\nlost to sight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\nAN ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY\\n\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" cried the cook, entering the room; \"when will\\nmaster have his dinner?\"\\n\\n\"Never.\"\\n\\n\"And, his supper?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. He says he will eat no more, neither shall I. My uncle\\nhas determined to fast and make me fast until he makes out this\\nabominable inscription,\" I replied.\\n\\n\"You will be starved to death,\" she said.\\n\\nI was very much of the same opinion, but not liking to say so, sent her\\naway, and began some of my usual work of classification. But try as I\\nmight, nothing could keep me from thinking alternately of the stupid\\nmanuscript and of the pretty Gretchen.\\n\\nSeveral times I thought of going out, but my uncle would have been angry\\nat my absence. At the end of an hour, my allotted task was done. How to\\npass the time? I began by lighting my pipe. Like all other students, I\\ndelighted in tobacco; and, seating myself in the great armchair, I began\\nto think.\\n\\nWhere was my uncle? I could easily imagine him tearing along some\\nsolitary road, gesticulating, talking to himself, cutting the air with\\nhis cane, and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics. Would\\nhe hit upon some clue? Would he come home in better humor? While these\\nthoughts were passing through my brain, I mechanically took up the\\nexecrable puzzle and tried every imaginable way of grouping the letters.\\nI put them together by twos, by threes, fours, and fives--in vain.\\nNothing intelligible came out, except that the fourteenth, fifteenth,\\nand sixteenth made <i>ice</i> in English; the eighty-fourth, eighty-fifth,\\nand eighty-sixth, the word <i>sir</i>; then at last I seemed to find the\\nLatin words <i>rota, mutabile, ira, nec, atra</i>.\\n\\n\"Ha! there seems to be some truth in my uncle\\'s notion,\" thought I.\\n\\nThen again I seemed to find the word <i>luco</i>, which means sacred wood.\\nThen in the third line I appeared to make out <i>labiled</i>, a perfect\\nHebrew word, and at the last the syllables mere, are, mer, which were\\nFrench.\\n\\nIt was enough to drive one mad. Four different idioms in this absurd\\nphrase. What connection could there be between ice, sir, anger, cruel,\\nsacred wood, changing, mother, are, and sea? The first and the last\\nmight, in a sentence connected with Iceland, mean sea of ice. But what\\nof the rest of this monstrous cryptograph?\\n\\nI was, in fact, fighting against an insurmountable difficulty; my brain\\nwas almost on fire; my eyes were strained with staring at the parchment;\\nthe whole absurd collection of letters appeared to dance before my\\nvision in a number of black little groups. My mind was possessed with\\ntemporary hallucination--I was stifling. I wanted air. Mechanically I\\nfanned myself with the document, of which now I saw the back and then\\nthe front.\\n\\nImagine my surprise when glancing at the back of the wearisome puzzle,\\nthe ink having gone through, I clearly made out Latin words, and among\\nothers craterem and terrestre.\\n\\nI had discovered the secret!\\n\\nIt came upon me like a flash of lightning. I had got the clue. All you\\nhad to do to understand the document was to read it backwards. All the\\ningenious ideas of the Professor were realized; he had dictated it\\nrightly to me; by a mere accident I had discovered what he so much\\ndesired.\\n\\nMy delight, my emotion may be imagined, my eyes were dazzled and I\\ntrembled so that at first I could make nothing of it. One look, however,\\nwould tell me all I wished to know.\\n\\n\"Let me read,\" I said to myself, after drawing a long breath.\\n\\nI spread it before me on the table, I passed my finger over each letter,\\nI spelled it through; in my excitement I read it out.\\n\\nWhat horror and stupefaction took possession of my soul. I was like a\\nman who had received a knock-down blow. Was it possible that I really\\nread the terrible secret, and it had really been accomplished! A man had\\ndared to do--what?\\n\\nNo living being should ever know.\\n\\n\"Never!\" cried I, jumping up. \"Never shall my uncle be made aware of the\\ndread secret. He would be quite capable of undertaking the terrible\\njourney. Nothing would check him, nothing stop him. Worse, he would\\ncompel me to accompany him, and we should be lost forever. But no; such\\nfolly and madness cannot be allowed.\"\\n\\nI was almost beside myself with rage and fury.\\n\\n\"My worthy uncle is already nearly mad,\" I cried aloud. \"This would\\nfinish him. By some accident he may make the discovery; in which case,\\nwe are both lost. Perish the fearful secret--let the flames forever bury\\nit in oblivion.\"\\n\\nI snatched up book and parchment, and was about to cast them into the\\nfire, when the door opened and my uncle entered.\\n\\nI had scarcely time to put down the wretched documents before my uncle\\nwas by my side. He was profoundly absorbed. His thoughts were evidently\\nbent on the terrible parchment. Some new combination had probably struck\\nhim while taking his walk.\\n\\nHe seated himself in his armchair, and with a pen began to make an\\nalgebraical calculation. I watched him with anxious eyes. My flesh\\ncrawled as it became probable that he would discover the secret.\\n\\nHis combinations I knew now were useless, I having discovered the one\\nonly clue. For three mortal hours he continued without speaking a word,\\nwithout raising his head, scratching, rewriting, calculating over and\\nover again. I knew that in time he must hit upon the right phrase. The\\nletters of every alphabet have only a certain number of combinations.\\nBut then years might elapse before he would arrive at the correct\\nsolution.\\n\\nStill time went on; night came, the sounds in the streets ceased--and\\nstill my uncle went on, not even answering our worthy cook when she\\ncalled us to supper.\\n\\nI did not dare to leave him, so waved her away, and at last fell asleep\\non the sofa.\\n\\nWhen I awoke my uncle was still at work. His red eyes, his pallid\\ncountenance, his matted hair, his feverish hands, his hectically flushed\\ncheeks, showed how terrible had been his struggle with the impossible,\\nand what fearful fatigue he had undergone during that long sleepless\\nnight. It made me quite ill to look at him. Though he was rather severe\\nwith me, I loved him, and my heart ached at his sufferings. He was so\\novercome by one idea that he could not even get in a passion! All his\\nenergies were focused on one point. And I knew that by speaking one\\nlittle word all this suffering would cease. I could not speak it.\\n\\nMy heart was, nevertheless, inclining towards him. Why, then, did I\\nremain silent? In the interest of my uncle himself.\\n\\n\"Nothing shall make me speak,\" I muttered. \"He will want to follow in\\nthe footsteps of the other! I know him well. His imagination is a\\nperfect volcano, and to make discoveries in the interests of geology he\\nwould sacrifice his life. I will therefore be silent and strictly keep\\nthe secret I have discovered. To reveal it would be suicidal. He would\\nnot only rush, himself, to destruction, but drag me with him.\"\\n\\nI crossed my arms, looked another way and smoked--resolved never to\\nspeak.\\n\\nWhen our cook wanted to go out to market, or on any other errand, she\\nfound the front door locked and the key taken away. Was this done\\npurposely or not? Surely Professor Hardwigg did not intend the old woman\\nand myself to become martyrs to his obstinate will. Were we to be\\nstarved to death? A frightful recollection came to my mind. Once we had\\nfed on bits and scraps for a week while he sorted some curiosities. It\\ngave me the cramp even to think of it!\\n\\nI wanted my breakfast, and I saw no way of getting it. Still my\\nresolution held good. I would starve rather than yield. But the cook\\nbegan to take me seriously to task. What was to be done? She could not\\ngo out; and I dared not.\\n\\nMy uncle continued counting and writing; his imagination seemed to have\\ntranslated him to the skies. He neither thought of eating nor drinking.\\nIn this way twelve o\\'clock came round. I was hungry, and there was\\nnothing in the house. The cook had eaten the last bit of bread. This\\ncould not go on. It did, however, until two, when my sensations were\\nterrible. After all, I began to think the document very absurd. Perhaps\\nit might only be a gigantic hoax. Besides, some means would surely be\\nfound to keep my uncle back from attempting any such absurd expedition.\\nOn the other hand, if he did attempt anything so quixotic, I should not\\nbe compelled to accompany him. Another line of reasoning partially\\ndecided me. Very likely he would make the discovery himself when I\\nshould have suffered starvation for nothing. Under the influence of\\nhunger this reasoning appeared admirable. I determined to tell all.\\n\\nThe question now arose as to how it was to be done. I was still dwelling\\non the thought, when he rose and put on his hat.\\n\\nWhat! go out and lock us in? Never!\\n\\n\"Uncle,\" I began.\\n\\nHe did not appear even to hear me.\\n\\n\"Professor Hardwigg,\" I cried.\\n\\n\"What,\" he retorted, \"did you speak?\"\\n\\n\"How about the key?\"\\n\\n\"What key--the key of the door?\"\\n\\n\"No--of these horrible hieroglyphics?\"\\n\\nHe looked at me from under his spectacles, and started at the odd\\nexpression of my face. Rushing forward, he clutched me by the arm and\\nkeenly examined my countenance. His very look was an interrogation.\\n\\nI simply nodded.\\n\\nWith an incredulous shrug of the shoulders, he turned upon his heel.\\nUndoubtedly he thought I had gone mad.\\n\\n\"I have made a very important discovery.\"\\n\\nHis eyes flashed with excitement. His hand was lifted in a menacing\\nattitude. For a moment neither of us spoke. It is hard to say which was\\nmost excited.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t mean to say that you have any idea of the meaning of the\\nscrawl?\"\\n\\n\"I do,\" was my desperate reply. \"Look at the sentence as dictated by\\nyou.\"\\n\\n\"Well, but it means nothing,\" was the angry answer.\\n\\n\"Nothing if you read from left to right, but mark, if from right to\\nleft--\"\\n\\n\"Backwards!\" cried my uncle, in wild amazement. \"Oh most cunning\\nSaknussemm; and I to be such a blockhead!\"\\n\\nHe snatched up the document, gazed at it with haggard eye, and read it\\nout as I had done.\\n\\nIt read as follows:\\n\\n\\n    <i>In Sneffels Yoculis craterem kem delibat\\n    umbra Scartaris Julii intra calendas descende,\\n    audas viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.\\n    Kod feci. Arne Saknussemm</i>\\n\\n\\nWhich dog Latin being translated, reads as follows:\\n\\n\\n     Descend into the crater of Yocul of Sneffels, which the shade of\\n     Scartaris caresses, before the kalends of July, audacious traveler,\\n     and you will reach the centre of the earth. I did it.\\n\\n                                               ARNE SAKNUSSEMM\\n\\n\\nMy uncle leaped three feet from the ground with joy. He looked radiant\\nand handsome. He rushed about the room wild with delight and\\nsatisfaction. He knocked over tables and chairs. He threw his books\\nabout until at last, utterly exhausted, he fell into his armchair.\\n\\n\"What\\'s o\\'clock?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"About three.\"\\n\\n\"My dinner does not seem to have done me much good,\" he observed. \"Let\\nme have something to eat. We can then start at once. Get my portmanteau\\nready.\"\\n\\n\"What for?\"\\n\\n\"And your own,\" he continued. \"We start at once.\"\\n\\nMy horror may be conceived. I resolved however to show no fear.\\nScientific reasons were the only ones likely to influence my uncle. Now,\\nthere were many against this terrible journey. The very idea of going\\ndown to the centre of the earth was simply absurd. I determined\\ntherefore to argue the point after dinner.\\n\\nMy uncle\\'s rage was now directed against the cook for having no dinner\\nready. My explanation however satisfied him, and having gotten the key,\\nshe soon contrived to get sufficient to satisfy our voracious appetites.\\n\\nDuring the repast my uncle was rather gay than otherwise. He made some\\nof those peculiar jokes which belong exclusively to the learned. As\\nsoon, however, as dessert was over, he called me to his study. We each\\ntook a chair on opposite sides of the table.\\n\\n\"Henry,\" he said, in a soft and winning voice; \"I have always believed\\nyou ingenious, and you have rendered me a service never to be forgotten.\\nWithout you, this great, this wondrous discovery would never have been\\nmade. It is my duty, therefore, to insist on your sharing the glory.\"\\n\\n\"He is in a good humor,\" thought I; \"I\\'ll soon let him know my opinion\\nof glory.\"\\n\\n\"In the first place,\" he continued, \"you must keep the whole affair a\\nprofound secret. There is no more envious race of men than scientific\\ndiscoverers. Many would start on the same journey. At all events, we\\nwill be the first in the field.\"\\n\\n\"I doubt your having many competitors,\" was my reply.\\n\\n\"A man of real scientific acquirements would be delighted at the chance.\\nWe should find a perfect stream of pilgrims on the traces of Arne\\nSaknussemm, if this document were once made public.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear sir, is not this paper very likely to be a hoax?\" I urged.\\n\\n\"The book in which we find it is sufficient proof of its authenticity,\"\\nhe replied.\\n\\n\"I thoroughly allow that the celebrated Professor wrote the lines, but\\nonly, I believe, as a kind of mystification,\" was my answer.\\n\\nScarcely were the words out of my mouth, when I was sorry I had uttered\\nthem. My uncle looked at me with a dark and gloomy scowl, and I began to\\nbe alarmed for the results of our conversation. His mood soon changed,\\nhowever, and a smile took the place of a frown.\\n\\n\"We shall see,\" he remarked, with decisive emphasis.\\n\\n\"But see, what is all this about Yocul, and Sneffels, and this\\nScartaris? I have never heard anything about them.\"\\n\\n\"The very point to which I am coming. I lately received from my friend\\nAugustus Peterman, of Leipzig, a map. Take down the third atlas from the\\nsecond shelf, series Z, plate 4.\"\\n\\nI rose, went to the shelf, and presently returned with the volume\\nindicated.\\n\\n\"This,\" said my uncle, \"is one of the best maps of Iceland. I believe it\\nwill settle all your doubts, difficulties and objections.\"\\n\\nWith a grim hope to the contrary, I stooped over the map.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nWE START ON THE JOURNEY\\n\\n\\n\"You see, the whole island is composed of volcanoes,\" said the\\nProfessor, \"and remark carefully that they all bear the name of Yocul.\\nThe word is Icelandic, and means a glacier. In most of the lofty\\nmountains of that region the volcanic eruptions come forth from icebound\\ncaverns. Hence the name applied to every volcano on this extraordinary\\nisland.\"\\n\\n\"But what does this word Sneffels mean?\"\\n\\nTo this question I expected no rational answer. I was mistaken.\\n\\n\"Follow my finger to the western coast of Iceland, there you see\\nReykjavik, its capital. Follow the direction of one of its innumerable\\nfjords or arms of the sea, and what do you see below the sixty-fifth\\ndegree of latitude?\"\\n\\n\"A peninsula--very like a thighbone in shape.\"\\n\\n\"And in the centre of it--?\"\\n\\n\"A mountain.\"\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s Sneffels.\"\\n\\nI had nothing to say.\\n\\n\"That is Sneffels--a mountain about five thousand feet in height, one of\\nthe most remarkable in the whole island, and certainly doomed to be the\\nmost celebrated in the world, for through its crater we shall reach the\\ncentre of the earth.\"\\n\\n\"Impossible!\" cried I, startled and shocked at the thought.\\n\\n\"Why impossible?\" said Professor Hardwigg in his severest tones.\\n\\n\"Because its crater is choked with lava, by burning rocks--by infinite\\ndangers.\"\\n\\n\"But if it be extinct?\"\\n\\n\"That would make a difference.\"\\n\\n\"Of course it would. There are about three hundred volcanoes on the\\nwhole surface of the globe--but the greater number are extinct. Of these\\nSneffels is one. No eruption has occurred since 1219--in fact it has\\nceased to be a volcano at all.\"\\n\\nAfter this what more could I say? Yes,--I thought of another objection.\\n\\n\"But what is all this about Scartaris and the kalends of July--?\"\\n\\nMy uncle reflected deeply. Presently he gave forth the result of his\\nreflections in a sententious tone. \"What appears obscure to you, to me\\nis light. This very phrase shows how particular Saknussemm is in his\\ndirections. The Sneffels mountain has many craters. He is careful\\ntherefore to point the exact one which is the highway into the Interior\\nof the Earth. He lets us know, for this purpose, that about the end of\\nthe month of June, the shadow of Mount Scartaris falls upon the one\\ncrater. There can be no doubt about the matter.\"\\n\\nMy uncle had an answer for everything.\\n\\n\"I accept all your explanations\" I said, \"and Saknussemm is right. He\\nfound out the entrance to the bowels of the earth, he has indicated\\ncorrectly, but that he or anyone else ever followed up the discovery is\\nmadness to suppose.\"\\n\\n\"Why so, young man?\"\\n\\n\"All scientific teaching, theoretical and practical, shows it to be\\nimpossible.\"\\n\\n\"I care nothing for theories,\" retorted my uncle.\\n\\n\"But is it not well-known that heat increases one degree for every\\nseventy feet you descend into the earth? Which gives a fine idea of the\\ncentral heat. All the matters which compose the globe are in a state of\\nincandescence; even gold, platinum, and the hardest rocks are in a state\\nof fusion. What would become of us?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be alarmed at the heat, my boy.\"\\n\\n\"How so?\"\\n\\n\"Neither you nor anybody else know anything about the real state of the\\nearth\\'s interior. All modern experiments tend to explode the older\\ntheories. Were any such heat to exist, the upper crust of the earth\\nwould be shattered to atoms, and the world would be at an end.\"\\n\\nA long, learned and not uninteresting discussion followed, which ended\\nin this wise:\\n\\n\"I do not believe in the dangers and difficulties which you, Henry, seem\\nto multiply; and the only way to learn, is like Arne Saknussemm, to go\\nand see.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried I, overcome at last, \"let us go and see. Though how we can\\ndo that in the dark is another mystery.\"\\n\\n\"Fear nothing. We shall overcome these, and many other difficulties.\\nBesides, as we approach the centre, I expect to find it luminous--\"\\n\\n\"Nothing is impossible.\"\\n\\n\"And now that we have come to a thorough understanding, not a word to\\nany living soul. Our success depends on secrecy and dispatch.\"\\n\\nThus ended our memorable conference, which roused a perfect fever in me.\\nLeaving my uncle, I went forth like one possessed. Reaching the banks of\\nthe Elbe, I began to think. Was all I had heard really and truly\\npossible? Was my uncle in his sober senses, and could the interior of\\nthe earth be reached? Was I the victim of a madman, or was he a\\ndiscoverer of rare courage and grandeur of conception?\\n\\nTo a certain extent I was anxious to be off. I was afraid my enthusiasm\\nwould cool. I determined to pack up at once. At the end of an hour,\\nhowever, on my way home, I found that my feelings had very much changed.\\n\\n\"I\\'m all abroad,\" I cried; \"\\'tis a nightmare--I must have dreamed it.\"\\n\\nAt this moment I came face to face with Gretchen, whom I warmly\\nembraced.\\n\\n\"So you have come to meet me,\" she said; \"how good of you. But what is\\nthe matter?\"\\n\\nWell, it was no use mincing the matter, I told her all. She listened\\nwith awe, and for some minutes she could not speak.\\n\\n\"Well?\" I at last said, rather anxiously.\\n\\n\"What a magnificent journey. If I were only a man! A journey worthy of\\nthe nephew of Professor Hardwigg. I should look upon it as an honor to\\naccompany him.\"\\n\\n\"My dear Gretchen, I thought you would be the first to cry out against\\nthis mad enterprise.\"\\n\\n\"No; on the contrary, I glory in it. It is magnificent, splendid--an\\nidea worthy of my father. Henry Lawson, I envy you.\"\\n\\nThis was, as it were, conclusive. The final blow of all.\\n\\nWhen we entered the house we found my uncle surrounded by workmen and\\nporters, who were packing up. He was pulling and hauling at a bell.\\n\\n\"Where have you been wasting your time? Your portmanteau is not\\npacked--my papers are not in order--the precious tailor has not brought\\nmy clothes, nor my gaiters--the key of my carpet bag is gone!\"\\n\\nI looked at him stupefied. And still he tugged away at the bell.\\n\\n\"We are really off, then?\" I said.\\n\\n\"Yes--of course, and yet you go out for a stroll, unfortunate boy!\"\\n\\n\"And when do we go?\"\\n\\n\"The day after tomorrow, at daybreak.\"\\n\\nI heard no more; but darted off to my little bedchamber and locked\\nmyself in. There was no doubt about it now. My uncle had been hard at\\nwork all the afternoon. The garden was full of ropes, rope ladders,\\ntorches, gourds, iron clamps, crowbars, alpenstocks, and\\npickaxes--enough to load ten men.\\n\\nI passed a terrible night. I was called early the next day to learn that\\nthe resolution of my uncle was unchanged and irrevocable. I also found\\nmy cousin and affianced wife as warm on the subject as was her father.\\n\\nNext day, at five o\\'clock in the morning, the post chaise was at the\\ndoor. Gretchen and the old cook received the keys of the house; and,\\nscarcely pausing to wish anyone good-by, we started on our adventurous\\njourney into the centre of the earth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nFirst Lessons in Climbing\\n\\n\\nAt Altona, a suburb of Hamburg, is the Chief Station of the Kiel\\nrailway, which was to take us to the shores of the Belt. In twenty\\nminutes from the moment of our departure we were in Holstein, and our\\ncarriage entered the station. Our heavy luggage was taken out, weighed,\\nlabeled, and placed in a huge van. We then took our tickets, and exactly\\nat seven o\\'clock were seated opposite each other in a firstclass railway\\ncarriage.\\n\\nMy uncle said nothing. He was too busy examining his papers, among which\\nof course was the famous parchment, and some letters of introduction\\nfrom the Danish consul which were to pave the way to an introduction to\\nthe Governor of Iceland. My only amusement was looking out of the\\nwindow. But as we passed through a flat though fertile country, this\\noccupation was slightly monotonous. In three hours we reached Kiel, and\\nour baggage was at once transferred to the steamer.\\n\\nWe had now a day before us, a delay of about ten hours. Which fact put\\nmy uncle in a towering passion. We had nothing to do but to walk about\\nthe pretty town and bay. At length, however, we went on board, and at\\nhalf past ten were steaming down the Great Belt. It was a dark night,\\nwith a strong breeze and a rough sea, nothing being visible but the\\noccasional fires on shore, with here and there a lighthouse. At seven in\\nthe morning we left Korsor, a little town on the western side of\\nSeeland.\\n\\nHere we took another railway, which in three hours brought us to the\\ncapital, Copenhagen, where, scarcely taking time for refreshment, my\\nuncle hurried out to present one of his letters of introduction. It was\\nto the director of the Museum of Antiquities, who, having been informed\\nthat we were tourists bound for Iceland, did all he could to assist us.\\nOne wretched hope sustained me now. Perhaps no vessel was bound for such\\ndistant parts.\\n\\nAlas! a little Danish schooner, the <i>Valkyrie</i>, was to sail on the\\nsecond of June for Reykjavik. The captain, M. Bjarne, was on board, and\\nwas rather surprised at the energy and cordiality with which his future\\npassenger shook him by the hand. To him a voyage to Iceland was merely a\\nmatter of course. My uncle, on the other hand, considered the event of\\nsublime importance. The honest sailor took advantage of the Professor\\'s\\nenthusiasm to double the fare.\\n\\n\"On Tuesday morning at seven o\\'clock be on board,\" said M. Bjarne,\\nhanding us our receipts.\\n\\n\"Excellent! Capital! Glorious!\" remarked my uncle as we sat down to a\\nlate breakfast; \"refresh yourself, my boy, and we will take a run\\nthrough the town.\"\\n\\nOur meal concluded, we went to the Kongens-Nye-Torw; to the king\\'s\\nmagnificent palace; to the beautiful bridge over the canal near the\\nMuseum; to the immense cenotaph of Thorwaldsen with its hideous naval\\ngroups; to the castle of Rosenberg; and to all the other lions of the\\nplace-none of which my uncle even saw, so absorbed was he in his\\nanticipated triumphs.\\n\\nBut one thing struck his fancy, and that was a certain singular steeple\\nsituated on the Island of Amak, which is the southeast quarter of the\\ncity of Copenhagen. My uncle at once ordered me to turn my steps that\\nway, and accordingly we went on board the steam ferry boat which does\\nduty on the canal, and very soon reached the noted dockyard quay.\\n\\nIn the first instance we crossed some narrow streets, where we met\\nnumerous groups of galley slaves, with particolored trousers, grey and\\nyellow, working under the orders and the sticks of severe taskmasters,\\nand finally reached the Vor-Frelser\\'s-Kirk.\\n\\nThis church exhibited nothing remarkable in itself; in fact, the worthy\\nProfessor had only been attracted to it by one circumstance, which was,\\nthat its rather elevated steeple started from a circular platform, after\\nwhich there was an exterior staircase, which wound round to the very\\nsummit.\\n\\n\"Let us ascend,\" said my uncle.\\n\\n\"But I never could climb church towers,\" I cried, \"I am subject to\\ndizziness in my head.\"\\n\\n\"The very reason why you should go up. I want to cure you of a bad\\nhabit.\"\\n\\n\"But, my good sir--\"\\n\\n\"I tell you to come. What is the use of wasting so much valuable time?\"\\n\\nIt was impossible to dispute the dictatorial commands of my uncle. I\\nyielded with a groan. On payment of a fee, a verger gave us the key. He,\\nfor one, was not partial to the ascent. My uncle at once showed me the\\nway, running up the steps like a schoolboy. I followed as well as I\\ncould, though no sooner was I outside the tower, than my head began to\\nswim. There was nothing of the eagle about me. The earth was enough for\\nme, and no ambitious desire to soar ever entered my mind. Still things\\ndid not go badly until I had ascended 150 steps, and was near the\\nplatform, when I began to feel the rush of cold air. I could scarcely\\nstand, when clutching the railings, I looked upwards. The railing was\\nfrail enough, but nothing to those which skirted the terrible winding\\nstaircase, that appeared, from where I stood, to ascend to the skies.\\n\\n\"Now then, Henry.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t do it!\" I cried, in accents of despair.\\n\\n\"Are you, after all, a coward, sir?\" said my uncle in a pitiless tone.\\n\"Go up, I say!\"\\n\\nTo this there was no reply possible. And yet the keen air acted\\nviolently on my nervous system; sky, earth, all seemed to swim round,\\nwhile the steeple rocked like a ship. My legs gave way like those of a\\ndrunken man. I crawled upon my hands and knees; I hauled myself up\\nslowly, crawling like a snake. Presently I closed my eyes, and allowed\\nmyself to be dragged upwards.\\n\\n\"Look around you,\" said my uncle in a stern voice, \"heaven knows what\\nprofound abysses you may have to look down. This is excellent practice.\"\\n\\nSlowly, and shivering all the while with cold, I opened my eyes. What\\nthen did I see? My first glance was upwards at the cold fleecy clouds,\\nwhich as by some optical delusion appeared to stand still, while the\\nsteeple, the weathercock, and our two selves were carried swiftly along.\\nFar away on one side could be seen the grassy plain, while on the other\\nlay the sea bathed in translucent light. The Sund, or Sound as we call\\nit, could be discovered beyond the point of Elsinore, crowded with white\\nsails, which, at that distance looked like the wings of seagulls; while\\nto the east could be made out the far-off coast of Sweden. The whole\\nappeared a magic panorama.\\n\\nBut faint and bewildered as I was, there was no remedy for it. Rise and\\nstand up I must. Despite my protestations my first lesson lasted quite\\nan hour. When, nearly two hours later, I reached the bosom of mother\\nearth, I was like a rheumatic old man bent double with pain.\\n\\n\"Enough for one day,\" said my uncle, rubbing his hands, \"we will begin\\nagain tomorrow.\"\\n\\nThere was no remedy. My lessons lasted five days, and at the end of that\\nperiod, I ascended blithely enough, and found myself able to look down\\ninto the depths below without even winking, and with some degree of\\npleasure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nOur Voyage to Iceland\\n\\n\\nThe hour of departure came at last. The night before, the worthy Mr.\\nThompson brought us the most cordial letters of introduction for Baron\\nTrampe, Governor of Iceland, for M. Pictursson, coadjutor to the bishop,\\nand for M. Finsen, mayor of the town of Reykjavik. In return, my uncle\\nnearly crushed his hands, so warmly did he shake them.\\n\\nOn the second of the month, at two in the morning, our precious cargo of\\nluggage was taken on board the good ship <i>Valkyrie</i>. We followed, and\\nwere very politely introduced by the captain to a small cabin with two\\nstanding bed places, neither very well ventilated nor very comfortable.\\nBut in the cause of science men are expected to suffer.\\n\\n\"Well, and have we a fair wind?\" cried my uncle, in his most mellifluous\\naccents.\\n\\n\"An excellent wind!\" replied Captain Bjarne; \"we shall leave the Sound,\\ngoing free with all sails set.\"\\n\\nA few minutes afterwards, the schooner started before the wind, under\\nall the canvas she could carry, and entered the channel. An hour later,\\nthe capital of Denmark seemed to sink into the waves, and we were at no\\ngreat distance from the coast of Elsinore. My uncle was delighted; for\\nmyself, moody and dissatisfied, I appeared almost to expect a glimpse of\\nthe ghost of Hamlet.\\n\\n\"Sublime madman,\" thought I, \"you doubtless would approve our\\nproceedings. You might perhaps even follow us to the centre of the\\nearth, there to resolve your eternal doubts.\"\\n\\nBut no ghost or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls. The fact\\nis, the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of\\nDenmark. It is now the residence of the keeper of the Strait of the\\nSound, and through that Sound more than fifteen thousand vessels of all\\nnations pass every year.\\n\\nThe castle of Kronborg soon disappeared in the murky atmosphere, as well\\nas the tower of Helsinborg, which raises its head on the Swedish Bank.\\nAnd here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breezes of the\\nKattegat. The <i>Valkyrie</i> was swift enough, but with all sailing boats\\nthere is the same uncertainty. Her cargo was coal, furniture, pottery,\\nwoolen clothing, and a load of corn. As usual, the crew was small, five\\nDanes doing the whole of the work.\\n\\n\"How long will the voyage last?\" asked my uncle.\\n\\n\"Well, I should think about ten days,\" replied the skipper, \"unless,\\nindeed, we meet with some northeast gales among the Faroe Islands.\"\\n\\n\"At all events, there will be no very considerable delay,\" cried the\\nimpatient Professor.\\n\\n\"No, Mr. Hardwigg,\" said the captain, \"no fear of that. At all events,\\nwe shall get there some day.\"\\n\\nTowards evening the schooner doubled Cape Skagen, the northernmost part\\nof Denmark, crossed the Skagerrak during the night--skirted the extreme\\npoint of Norway through the gut of Cape Lindesnes, and then reached the\\nNorthern Seas. Two days later we were not far from the coast of\\nScotland, somewhere near what Danish sailors call Peterhead, and then\\nthe <i>Valkyrie</i> stretched out direct for the Faroe Islands, between\\nOrkney and Shetland. Our vessel now felt the full force of the ocean\\nwaves, and the wind shifting, we with great difficulty made the Faroe\\nIsles. On the eighth day, the captain made out Myganness, the\\nwesternmost of the isles, and from that moment headed direct for\\nPortland, a cape on the southern shores of the singular island for which\\nwe were bound.\\n\\nThe voyage offered no incident worthy of record. I bore it very well,\\nbut my uncle to his great annoyance, and even shame, was remarkably\\nseasick! This mal de mer troubled him the more that it prevented him\\nfrom questioning Captain Bjarne as to the subject of Sneffels, as to the\\nmeans of communication, and the facilities of transport. All these\\nexplanations he had to adjourn to the period of his arrival. His time,\\nmeanwhile, was spent lying in bed groaning, and dwelling anxiously on\\nthe hoped--for termination of the voyage. I didn\\'t pity him.\\n\\nOn the eleventh day we sighted Cape Portland, over which towered Mount\\nMyrdals Yokul, which, the weather being clear, we made out very readily.\\nThe cape itself is nothing but a huge mount of granite standing naked\\nand alone to meet the Atlantic waves. The <i>Valkyrie</i> kept off the coast,\\nsteering to the westward. On all sides were to be seen whole \"schools\"\\nof whales and sharks. After some hours we came in sight of a solitary\\nrock in the ocean, forming a mighty vault, through which the foaming\\nwaves poured with intense fury. The islets of Westman appeared to leap\\nfrom the ocean, being so low in the water as scarcely to be seen until\\nyou were right upon them. From that moment the schooner was steered to\\nthe westward in order to round Cape Reykjanes, the western point of\\nIceland.\\n\\nMy uncle, to his great disgust, was unable even to crawl on deck, so\\nheavy a sea was on, and thus lost the first view of the Land of Promise.\\nForty-eight hours later, after a storm which drove us far to sea under\\nbare poles, we came once more in sight of land, and were boarded by a\\npilot, who, after three hours of dangerous navigation, brought the\\nschooner safely to an anchor in the bay of Faxa before Reykjavik.\\n\\nMy uncle came out of his cabin pale, haggard, thin, but full of\\nenthusiasm, his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction. Nearly the\\nwhole population of the town was on foot to see us land. The fact was,\\nthat scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical\\nvessel.\\n\\nProfessor Hardwigg was in haste to leave his prison, or rather as he\\ncalled it, his hospital; but before he attempted to do so, he caught\\nhold of my hand, led me to the quarterdeck of the schooner, took my arm\\nwith his left hand, and pointed inland with his right, over the northern\\npart of the bay, to where rose a high two-peaked mountain--a double cone\\ncovered with eternal snow.\\n\\n\"Behold he whispered in an awe-stricken voice, behold--Mount Sneffels!\"\\n\\nThen without further remark, he put his finger to his lips, frowned\\ndarkly, and descended into the small boat which awaited us. I followed,\\nand in a few minutes we stood upon the soil of mysterious Iceland!\\n\\nScarcely were we fairly on shore when there appeared before us a man of\\nexcellent appearance, wearing the costume of a military officer. He was,\\nhowever, but a civil servant, a magistrate, the governor of the\\nisland--Baron Trampe. The Professor knew whom he had to deal with. He\\ntherefore handed him the letters from Copenhagen, and a brief\\nconversation in Danish followed, to which I of course was a stranger,\\nand for a very good reason, for I did not know the language in which\\nthey conversed. I afterwards heard, however, that Baron Trampe placed\\nhimself entirely at the beck and call of Professor Hardwigg.\\n\\nMy uncle was most graciously received by M. Finsen, the mayor, who as\\nfar as costume went, was quite as military as the governor, but also\\nfrom character and occupation quite as pacific. As for his coadjutor, M.\\nPictursson, he was absent on an episcopal visit to the northern portion\\nof the diocese. We were therefore compelled to defer the pleasure of\\nbeing presented to him. His absence was, however, more than compensated\\nby the presence of M. Fridriksson, professor of natural science in the\\ncollege of Reykjavik, a man of invaluable ability. This modest scholar\\nspoke no languages save Icelandic and Latin. When, therefore, he\\naddressed himself to me in the language of Horace, we at once came to\\nunderstand one another. He was, in fact, the only person that I did\\nthoroughly understand during the whole period of my residence in this\\nbenighted island.\\n\\nOut of three rooms of which his house was composed, two were placed at\\nour service, and in a few hours we were installed with all our baggage,\\nthe amount of which rather astonished the simple inhabitants of\\nReykjavik.\\n\\n\"Now, Harry,\" said my uncle, rubbing his hands, \"an goes well, the worse\\ndifficulty is now over.\"\\n\\n\"How the worse difficulty over?\" I cried in fresh amazement.\\n\\n\"Doubtless. Here we are in Iceland. Nothing more remains but to descend\\ninto the bowels of the earth.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, to a certain extent you are right. We have only to go\\ndown--but, as far as I am concerned, that is not the question. I want to\\nknow how we are to get up again.\"\\n\\n\"That is the least part of the business, and does not in any way trouble\\nme. In the meantime, there is not an hour to lose. I am about to visit\\nthe public library. Very likely I may find there some manuscripts from\\nthe hand of Saknussemm. I shall be glad to consult them.\"\\n\\n\"In the meanwhile,\" I replied, \"I will take a walk through the town.\\nWill you not likewise do so?\"\\n\\n\"I feel no interest in the subject,\" said my uncle. \"What for me is\\ncurious in this island, is not what is above the surface, but what is\\nbelow.\"\\n\\nI bowed by way of reply, put on my hat and furred cloak, and went out.\\n\\nIt was not an easy matter to lose oneself in the two streets of\\nReykjavik; I had therefore no need to ask my way. The town lies on a\\nflat and marshy plain, between two hills. A vast field of lava skirts it\\non one side, falling away in terraces towards the sea. On the other hand\\nis the large bay of Faxa, bordered on the north by the enormous glacier\\nof Sneffels, and in which bay the <i>Valkyrie</i> was then the only vessel at\\nanchor. Generally there were one or two English or French gunboats, to\\nwatch and protect the fisheries in the offing. They were now, however,\\nabsent on duty.\\n\\nThe longest of the streets of Reykjavik runs parallel to the shore. In\\nthis street the merchants and traders live in wooden huts made with\\nbeams of wood, painted red--mere log huts, such as you find in the wilds\\nof America. The other street, situated more to the west, runs toward a\\nlittle lake between the residences of the bishop and the other\\npersonages not engaged in commerce.\\n\\nI had soon seen all I wanted of these weary and dismal thoroughfares.\\nHere and there was a strip of discolored turf, like an old worn-out bit\\nof woolen carpet; and now and then a bit of kitchen garden, in which\\ngrew potatoes, cabbage, and lettuce, almost diminutive enough to suggest\\nthe idea of Lilliput.\\n\\nIn the centre of the new commercial street, I found the public cemetery,\\nenclosed by an earthen wall. Though not very large, it appeared not\\nlikely to be filled for centuries. From hence I went to the house of the\\nGovernor--a mere hut in comparison with the Mansion House of\\nHamburg--but a palace alongside the other Icelandic houses. Between the\\nlittle lake and the town was the church, built in simple Protestant\\nstyle, and composed of calcined stones, thrown up by volcanic action. I\\nhave not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown\\nout, to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation. Upon an\\neminence close at hand was the national school, in which were taught\\nHebrew, English, French, and Danish.\\n\\nIn three hours my tour was complete. The general impression upon my mind\\nwas sadness. No trees, no vegetation, so to speak--on all sides volcanic\\npeaks--the huts of turf and earth--more like roofs than houses. Thanks\\nto the heat of these residences, grass grows on the roof, which grass is\\ncarefully cut for hay. I saw but few inhabitants during my excursion,\\nbut I met a crowd on the beach, drying, salting and loading codfish, the\\nprincipal article of exportation. The men appeared robust but heavy;\\nfair-haired like Germans, but of pensive mien--exiles of a higher scale\\nin the ladder of humanity than the Eskimos, but, I thought, much more\\nunhappy, since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live\\nwithin the limits of the Polar Circle.\\n\\nSometimes they gave vent to a convulsive laugh, but by no chance did\\nthey smile. Their costume consists of a coarse capote of black wool,\\nknown in Scandinavian countries as the \"vadmel,\" a broad-brimmed hat,\\ntrousers of red serge, and a piece of leather tied with strings for a\\nshoe--a coarse kind of moccasin. The women, though sad-looking and\\nmournful, had rather agreeable features, without much expression. They\\nwear a bodice and petticoat of somber vadmel. When unmarried they wear a\\nlittle brown knitted cap over a crown of plaited hair; but when married,\\nthey cover their heads with a colored handkerchief, over which they tie\\na white scarf.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nConversation and Discovery\\n\\n\\nWhen I returned, dinner was ready. This meal was devoured by my worthy\\nrelative with avidity and voracity. His shipboard diet had turned his\\ninterior into a perfect gulf. The repast, which was more Danish than\\nIcelandic, was in itself nothing, but the excessive hospitality of our\\nhost made us enjoy it doubly.\\n\\nThe conversation turned upon scientific matters, and M. Fridriksson\\nasked my uncle what he thought of the public library.\\n\\n\"Library, sir?\" cried my uncle; \"it appears to me a collection of\\nuseless odd volumes, and a beggarly amount of empty shelves.\"\\n\\n\"What!\" cried M. Fridriksson; \"why, we have eight thousand volumes of\\nmost rare and valuable works--some in the Scandinavian language, besides\\nall the new publications from Copenhagen.\"\\n\\n\"Eight thousand volumes, my dear sir--why, where are they?\" cried my\\nuncle.\\n\\n\"Scattered over the country, Professor Hardwigg. We are very studious,\\nmy dear sir, though we do live in Iceland. Every farmer, every laborer,\\nevery fisherman can both read and write--and we think that books instead\\nof being locked up in cupboards, far from the sight of students, should\\nbe distributed as widely as possible. The books of our library are\\ntherefore passed from hand to hand without returning to the library\\nshelves perhaps for years.\"\\n\\n\"Then when foreigners visit you, there is nothing for them to see?\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir, foreigners have their own libraries, and our first\\nconsideration is, that our humbler classes should be highly educated.\\nFortunately, the love of study is innate in the Icelandic people. In\\n1816 we founded a Literary Society and Mechanics\\' Institute; many\\nforeign scholars of eminence are honorary members; we publish books\\ndestined to educate our people, and these books have rendered valuable\\nservices to our country. Allow me to have the honor, Professor Hardwigg,\\nto enroll you as an honorary member?\"\\n\\nMy uncle, who already belonged to nearly every literary and scientific\\ninstitution in Europe, immediately yielded to the amiable wishes of good\\nM. Fridriksson.\\n\\n\"And now,\" he said, after many expressions of gratitude and good will,\\n\"if you will tell me what books you expected to find, perhaps I may be\\nof some assistance to you.\"\\n\\nI watched my uncle keenly. For a minute or two he hesitated, as if\\nunwilling to speak; to speak openly was, perhaps, to unveil his\\nprojects. Nevertheless, after some reflection, he made up his mind.\\n\\n\"Well, M. Fridriksson,\" he said in an easy, unconcerned kind of way, \"I\\nwas desirous of ascertaining, if among other valuable works, you had any\\nof the learned Arne Saknussemm.\"\\n\\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" cried the Professor of Reykjavik; \"you speak of one\\nof the most distinguished scholars of the sixteenth century, of the\\ngreat naturalist, the great alchemist, the great traveler.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so.\"\\n\\n\"One of the most distinguished men connected with Icelandic science and\\nliterature.\"\\n\\n\"As you say, sir--\"\\n\\n\"A man illustrious above all.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, all this is true, but his works?\"\\n\\n\"We have none of them.\"\\n\\n\"Not in Iceland?\"\\n\\n\"There are none in Iceland or elsewhere,\" answered the other, sadly.\\n\\n\"Why so?\"\\n\\n\"Because Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy, and in 1573 his\\nworks were publicly burnt at Copenhagen, by the hands of the common\\nhangman.\"\\n\\n\"Very good! capital!\" murmured my uncle, to the great astonishment of\\nthe worthy Icelander.\\n\\n\"You said, sir--\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, all is clear, I see the link in the chain; everything is\\nexplained, and I now understand why Arne Saknussemm, put out of court,\\nforced to hide his magnificent discoveries, was compelled to conceal\\nbeneath the veil of an incomprehensible cryptograph, the secret--\"\\n\\n\"What secret?\"\\n\\n\"A secret--which,\" stammered my uncle.\\n\\n\"Have you discovered some wonderful manuscript?\" cried M. Fridriksson.\\n\\n\"No! no, I was carried away by my enthusiasm. A mere supposition.\"\\n\\n\"Very good, sir. But, really, to turn to another subject, I hope you\\nwill not leave our island without examining into its mineralogical\\nriches.\"\\n\\n\"Well, the fact is, I am rather late. So many learned men have been here\\nbefore me.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes, but there is still much to be done,\" cried M. Fridriksson.\\n\\n\"You think so,\" said my uncle, his eyes twinkling with hidden\\nsatisfaction.\\n\\n\"Yes, you have no idea how many unknown mountains, glaciers, volcanoes\\nthere are which remain to be studied. Without moving from where we sit,\\nI can show you one. Yonder on the edge of the horizon, you see\\nSneffels.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, Sneffels,\" said my uncle.\\n\\n\"One of the most curious volcanoes in existence, the crater of which has\\nbeen rarely visited.\"\\n\\n\"Extinct?\"\\n\\n\"Extinct, any time these five hundred years,\" was the ready reply.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said my uncle, who dug his nails into his flesh, and pressed his\\nknees tightly together to prevent himself leaping up with joy. \"I have a\\ngreat mind to begin my studies with an examination of the geological\\nmysteries of this Mount Seffel--Feisel--what do you call it?\"\\n\\n\"Sneffels, my dear sir.\"\\n\\nThis portion of the conversation took place in Latin, and I therefore\\nunderstood all that had been said. I could scarcely keep my countenance\\nwhen I found my uncle so cunningly concealing his delight and\\nsatisfaction. I must confess that his artful grimaces, put on to conceal\\nhis happiness, made him look like a new Mephistopheles.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he continued, \"your proposition delights me. I will endeavor\\nto climb to the summit of Sneffels, and, if possible, will descend into\\nits crater.\"\\n\\n\"I very much regret,\" continued M. Fridriksson, \"that my occupation will\\nentirely preclude the possibility of my accompanying you. It would have\\nbeen both pleasurable and profitable if I could have spared the time.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, a thousand times no,\" cried my uncle. \"I do not wish to disturb\\nthe serenity of any man. I thank you, however, with all my heart. The\\npresence of one so learned as yourself, would no doubt have been most\\nuseful, but the duties of your office and profession before everything.\"\\n\\nIn the innocence of his simple heart, our host did not perceive the\\nirony of these remarks.\\n\\n\"I entirely approve your project,\" continued the Icelander after some\\nfurther remarks. \"It is a good idea to begin by examining this volcano.\\nYou will make a harvest of curious observations. In the first place, how\\ndo you propose to get to Sneffels?\"\\n\\n\"By sea. I shall cross the bay. Of course that is the most rapid route.\"\\n\\n\"Of course. But still it cannot be done.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\"\\n\\n\"We have not an available boat in all Reykjavik,\" replied the other.\\n\\n\"What is to be done?\"\\n\\n\"You must go by land along the coast. It is longer, but much more\\ninteresting.\"\\n\\n\"Then I must have a guide.\"\\n\\n\"Of course; and I have your very man.\"\\n\\n\"Somebody on whom I can depend.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, an inhabitant of the peninsula on which Sneffels is situated. He\\nis a very shrewd and worthy man, with whom you will be pleased. He\\nspeaks Danish like a Dane.\"\\n\\n\"When can I see him--today?\"\\n\\n\"No, tomorrow; he will not be here before.\"\\n\\n\"Tomorrow be it,\" replied my uncle, with a deep sigh.\\n\\nThe conversation ended by compliments on both sides. During the dinner\\nmy uncle had learned much as to the history of Arne Saknussemm, the\\nreasons for his mysterious and hieroglyphical document. He also became\\naware that his host would not accompany him on his adventurous\\nexpedition, and that next day we should have a guide.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\n\\nTHE EIDER-DOWN HUNTER--OFF AT LAST\\n\\n\\nThat evening I took a brief walk on the shore near Reykjavik, after\\nwhich I returned to an early sleep on my bed of coarse planks, where I\\nslept the sleep of the just. When I awoke I heard my uncle speaking\\nloudly in the next room. I rose hastily and joined him. He was talking\\nin Danish with a man of tall stature, and of perfectly Herculean build.\\nThis man appeared to be possessed of very great strength. His eyes,\\nwhich started rather prominently from a very large head, the face\\nbelonging to which was simple and naive, appeared very quick and\\nintelligent. Very long hair, which even in England would have been\\naccounted exceedingly red, fell over his athletic shoulders. This native\\nof Iceland was active and supple in appearance, though he scarcely moved\\nhis arms, being in fact one of those men who despise the habit of\\ngesticulation common to southern people.\\n\\nEverything in this man\\'s manner revealed a calm and phlegmatic\\ntemperament. There was nothing indolent about him, but his appearance\\nspoke of tranquillity. He was one of those who never seemed to expect\\nanything from anybody, who liked to work when he thought proper, and\\nwhose philosophy nothing could astonish or trouble.\\n\\nI began to comprehend his character, simply from the way in which he\\nlistened to the wild and impassioned verbiage of my worthy uncle. While\\nthe excellent Professor spoke sentence after sentence, he stood with\\nfolded arms, utterly still, motionless to all my uncle\\'s gesticulations.\\nWhen he wanted to say No he moved his head from left to right; when he\\nacquiesced he nodded, so slightly that you could scarcely see the\\nundulation of his head. This economy of motion was carried to the length\\nof avarice.\\n\\nJudging from his appearance I should have been a long time before I had\\nsuspected him to be what he was, a mighty hunter. Certainly his manner\\nwas not likely to frighten the game. How, then, did he contrive to get\\nat his prey?\\n\\nMy surprise was slightly modified when I knew that this tranquil and\\nsolemn personage was only a hunter of the eider duck, the down of which\\nis, after all, the greatest source of the Icelanders\\' wealth.\\n\\nIn the early days of summer, the female of the eider, a pretty sort of\\nduck, builds its nest amid the rocks of the fjords--the name given to\\nall narrow gulfs in Scandinavian countries--with which every part of the\\nisland is indented. No sooner has the eider duck made her nest than she\\nlines the inside of it with the softest down from her breast. Then comes\\nthe hunter or trader, taking away the nest, the poor bereaved female\\nbegins her task over again, and this continues as long as any eider down\\nis to be found.\\n\\nWhen she can find no more the male bird sets to work to see what he can\\ndo. As, however, his down is not so soft, and has therefore no\\ncommercial value, the hunter does not take the trouble to rob him of his\\nnest lining. The nest is accordingly finished, the eggs are laid, the\\nlittle ones are born, and next year the harvest of eider down is again\\ncollected.\\n\\nNow, as the eider duck never selects steep rocks or aspects to build its\\nnest, but rather sloping and low cliffs near to the sea, the Icelandic\\nhunter can carry on his trade operations without much difficulty. He is\\nlike a farmer who has neither to plow, to sow, nor to harrow, only to\\ncollect his harvest.\\n\\nThis grave, sententious, silent person, as phlegmatic as an Englishman\\non the French stage, was named Hans Bjelke. He had called upon us in\\nconsequence of the recommendation of M. Fridriksson. He was, in fact,\\nour future guide. It struck me that had I sought the world over, I could\\nnot have found a greater contradiction to my impulsive uncle.\\n\\nThey, however, readily understood one another. Neither of them had any\\nthought about money; one was ready to take all that was offered him, the\\nother ready to offer anything that was asked. It may readily be\\nconceived, then, that an understanding was soon come to between them.\\n\\nNow, the understanding was, that he was to take us to the village of\\nStapi, situated on the southern slope of the peninsula of Sneffels, at\\nthe very foot of the volcano. Hans, the guide, told us the distance was\\nabout twenty-two miles, a journey which my uncle supposed would take\\nabout two days.\\n\\nBut when my uncle came to understand that they were Danish miles, of\\neight thousand yards each, he was obliged to be more moderate in his\\nideas, and, considering the horrible roads we had to follow, to allow\\neight or ten days for the journey.\\n\\nFour horses were prepared for us, two to carry the baggage, and two to\\nbear the important weight of myself and uncle. Hans declared that\\nnothing ever would make him climb on the back of any animal. He knew\\nevery inch of that part of the coast, and promised to take us the very\\nshortest way.\\n\\nHis engagement with my uncle was by no means to cease with our arrival\\nat Stapi; he was further to remain in his service during the whole time\\nrequired for the completion of his scientific investigations, at the\\nfixed salary of three rix-dollars a week, being exactly fourteen\\nshillings and twopence, minus one farthing, English currency. One\\nstipulation, however, was made by the guide--the money was to be paid to\\nhim every Saturday night, failing which, his engagement was at an end.\\n\\nThe day of our departure was fixed. My uncle wished to hand the\\neider-down hunter an advance, but he refused in one emphatic word--\\n\\n\"Efter.\"\\n\\nWhich being translated from Icelandic into plain English means--\"After.\"\\n\\nThe treaty concluded, our worthy guide retired without another word.\\n\\n\"A splendid fellow,\" said my uncle; \"only he little suspects the\\nmarvelous part he is about to play in the history of the world.\"\\n\\n\"You mean, then,\" I cried in amazement, \"that he should accompany us?\"\\n\\n\"To the interior of the earth, yes,\" replied my uncle. \"Why not?\"\\n\\nThere were yet forty-eight hours to elapse before we made our final\\nstart. To my great regret, our whole time was taken up in making\\npreparations for our journey. All our industry and ability were devoted\\nto packing every object in the most advantageous manner--the instruments\\non one side, the arms on the other, the tools here and the provisions\\nthere. There were, in fact, four distinct groups.\\n\\nThe instruments were of course of the best manufacture:\\n\\n1. A centigrade thermometer of Eigel, counting up to 150 degrees, which\\nto me did not appear half enough--or too much. Too hot by half, if the\\ndegree of heat was to ascend so high--in which case we should certainly\\nbe cooked--not enough, if we wanted to ascertain the exact temperature\\nof springs or metal in a state of fusion.\\n\\n2. A manometer worked by compressed air, an instrument used to ascertain\\nthe upper atmospheric pressure on the level of the ocean. Perhaps a\\ncommon barometer would not have done as well, the atmospheric pressure\\nbeing likely to increase in proportion as we descended below the surface\\nof the earth.\\n\\n3. A first-class chronometer made by Boissonnas, of Geneva, set at the\\nmeridian of Hamburg, from which Germans calculate, as the English do\\nfrom Greenwich, and the French from Paris.\\n\\n4. Two compasses, one for horizontal guidance, the other to ascertain\\nthe dip.\\n\\n5. A night glass.\\n\\n6. Two Ruhmkorff coils, which, by means of a current of electricity,\\nwould ensure us a very excellent, easily carried, and certain means of\\nobtaining light.\\n\\n7. A voltaic battery on the newest principle.[1]\\n\\n[1] Thermometer (<i>thermos</i>, and <i>metron</i>, measure); an instrument for\\nmeasuring the temperature of the air.--Manometer (<i>manos</i>,and <i>metron</i>,\\nmeasure); an instrument to show the density or rarity of\\ngases.--Chronometer (<i>chronos</i>. time, and <i>metros</i>, measure) a time\\nmeasurer, or superior watch--Ruhmkorff\\'s coil, an instrument for\\nproducing currents of induced electricity of great intensity. It\\nconsists of a coil of copper wire, insulated by being covered with silk,\\nsurrounded by another coil of fine wire, also insulated, in which a\\nmomentary current is induced when a current is passed through the inner\\ncoil from a voltaic battery. When the apparatus is in action, the gas\\nbecomes luminous, and produces a white and continued light. The battery\\nand wire are carried in a leather bag, which the traveler fastens by a\\nstrap to his shoulders. The lantern is in front, and enables the\\nbenighted wanderer to see in the most profound obscurity. He may venture\\nwithout fear of explosion into the midst of the most inflammable gases,\\nand the lantern will burn beneath the deepest waters. H. D. Ruhmkorff,\\nan able and learned chemist, discovered the induction coil. In 1864 he\\nwon the quinquennial French prize of £2,000 for this ingenious\\napplication of electricity--A voltaic battery, so called from Volta, its\\ndesigner, is an apparatus consisting of a series of metal plates\\narranged in pairs and subjected to the action of saline solutions for\\nproducing currents of electricity.\\n\\nOur arms consisted of two rifles, with two revolving six-shooters. Why\\nthese arms were provided it was impossible for me to say. I had every\\nreason to believe that we had neither wild beasts nor savage natives to\\nfear. My uncle, on the other hand, was quite as devoted to his arsenal\\nas to his collection of instruments, and above all was very careful with\\nhis provision of fulminating or gun cotton, warranted to keep in any\\nclimate, and of which the expansive force was known to be greater than\\nthat of ordinary gunpowder.\\n\\nOur tools consisted of two pickaxes, two crowbars, a silken ladder,\\nthree iron-shod Alpine poles, a hatchet, a hammer, a dozen wedges, some\\npointed pieces of iron, and a quantity of strong rope. You may conceive\\nthat the whole made a tolerable parcel, especially when I mention that\\nthe ladder itself was three hundred feet long!\\n\\nThen there came the important question of provisions. The hamper was not\\nvery large but tolerably satisfactory, for I knew that in concentrated\\nessence of meat and biscuit there was enough to last six months. The\\nonly liquid provided by my uncle was Schiedam. Of water, not a drop. We\\nhad, however, an ample supply of gourds, and my uncle counted on finding\\nwater, and enough to fill them, as soon as we commenced our downward\\njourney. My remarks as to the temperature, the quality, and even as to\\nthe possibility of none being found, remained wholly without effect.\\n\\nTo make up the exact list of our traveling gear--for the guidance of\\nfuture travelers--add, that we carried a medicine and surgical chest\\nwith all apparatus necessary for wounds, fractures and blows; lint,\\nscissors, lancets--in fact, a perfect collection of horrible looking\\ninstruments; a number of vials containing ammonia, alcohol, ether,\\nGoulard water, aromatic vinegar, in fact, every possible and impossible\\ndrug--finally, all the materials for working the Ruhmkorff coil!\\n\\nMy uncle had also been careful to lay in a goodly supply of tobacco,\\nseveral flasks of very fine gunpowder, boxes of tinder, besides a large\\nbelt crammed full of notes and gold. Good boots rendered watertight were\\nto be found to the number of six in the tool box.\\n\\n\"My boy, with such clothing, with such boots, and such general\\nequipment,\" said my uncle, in a state of rapturous delight, \"we may hope\\nto travel far.\"\\n\\nIt took a whole day to put all these matters in order. In the evening we\\ndined with Baron Trampe, in company with the Mayor of Reykjavik, and\\nDoctor Hyaltalin, the great medical man of Iceland. M. Fridriksson was\\nnot present, and I was afterwards sorry to hear that he and the governor\\ndid not agree on some matters connected with the administration of the\\nisland. Unfortunately, the consequence was, that I did not understand a\\nword that was said at dinner--a kind of semiofficial reception. One\\nthing I can say, my uncle never left off speaking.\\n\\nThe next day our labor came to an end. Our worthy host delighted my\\nuncle, Professor Hardwigg, by giving him a good map of Iceland, a most\\nimportant and precious document for a mineralogist.\\n\\nOur last evening was spent in a long conversation with M. Fridriksson,\\nwhom I liked very much--the more that I never expected to see him or\\nanyone else again. After this agreeable way of spending an hour or so, I\\ntried to sleep. In vain; with the exception of a few dozes, my night was\\nmiserable.\\n\\nAt five o\\'clock in the morning I was awakened from the only real half\\nhour\\'s sleep of the night by the loud neighing of horses under my\\nwindow. I hastily dressed myself and went down into the street. Hans was\\nengaged in putting the finishing stroke to our baggage, which he did in\\na silent, quiet way that won my admiration, and yet he did it admirably\\nwell. My uncle wasted a great deal of breath in giving him directions,\\nbut worthy Hans took not the slightest notice of his words.\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock all our preparations were completed, and M. Fridriksson\\nshook hands heartily with us. My uncle thanked him warmly, in the\\nIcelandic language, for his kind hospitality, speaking truly from the\\nheart.\\n\\nAs for myself I put together a few of my best Latin phrases and paid him\\nthe highest compliments I could. This fraternal and friendly duty\\nperformed, we sallied forth and mounted our horses.\\n\\nAs soon as we were quite ready, M. Fridriksson advanced, and by way of\\nfarewell, called after me in the words of Virgil--words which appeared\\nto have been made for us, travelers starting for an uncertain\\ndestination:\\n\\n\"Et quacunque viam dederit fortuna sequamur.\"\\n\\n(\"And whichsoever way thou goest, may fortune follow!\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\nOUR START--WE MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY\\n\\n\\nThe weather was overcast but settled, when we commenced our adventurous\\nand perilous journey. We had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor\\ndrenching rain. It was, in fact, real tourist weather.\\n\\nAs there was nothing I liked better than horse exercise, the pleasure of\\nriding through an unknown country caused the early part of our\\nenterprise to be particularly agreeable to me.\\n\\nI began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling, a life of\\ndesire, gratification and liberty. The truth is, that my spirits rose so\\nrapidly, that I began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be\\na terrible journey.\\n\\n\"After all,\" I said to myself, \"what do I risk? Simply to take a journey\\nthrough a curious country, to climb a remarkable mountain, and if the\\nworst comes to the worst, to descend into the crater of an extinct\\nvolcano.\"\\n\\nThere could be no doubt that this was all this terrible Saknussemm had\\ndone. As to the existence of a gallery, or of subterraneous passages\\nleading into the interior of the earth, the idea was simply absurd, the\\nhallucination of a distempered imagination. All, then, that may be\\nrequired of me I will do cheerfully, and will create no difficulty.\\n\\nIt was just before we left Reykjavik that I came to this decision.\\n\\nHans, our extraordinary guide, went first, walking with a steady, rapid,\\nunvarying step. Our two horses with the luggage followed of their own\\naccord, without requiring whip or spur. My uncle and I came behind,\\ncutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals.\\n\\nIceland is one of the largest islands in Europe. It contains thirty\\nthousand square miles of surface, and has about seventy thousand\\ninhabitants. Geographers have divided it into four parts, and we had to\\ncross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called Sudvestr\\nFjordungr.\\n\\nHans, on taking his departure from Reykjavik, had followed the line of\\nthe sea. We took our way through poor and sparse meadows, which made a\\ndesperate effort every year to show a little green. They very rarely\\nsucceed in a good show of yellow.\\n\\nThe rugged summits of the rocky hills were dimly visible on the edge of\\nthe horizon, through the misty fogs; every now and then some heavy\\nflakes of snow showed conspicuous in the morning light, while certain\\nlofty and pointed rocks were first lost in the grey low clouds, their\\nsummits clearly visible above, like jagged reefs rising from a troublous\\nsea.\\n\\nEvery now and then a spur of rock came down through the arid ground,\\nleaving us scarcely room to pass. Our horses, however, appeared not only\\nwell acquainted with the country, but by a kind of instinct, knew which\\nwas the best road. My uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging\\nforward his steed by whip, spur, or voice. It was utterly useless to\\nshow any signs of impatience. I could not help smiling to see him look\\nso big on his little horse; his long legs now and then touching the\\nground made him look like a six-footed centaur.\\n\\n\"Good beast, good beast,\" he would cry. \"I assure you, that I begin to\\nthink no animal is more intelligent than an Icelandic horse. Snow,\\ntempest, impracticable roads, rocks, icebergs--nothing stops him. He is\\nbrave; he is sober; he is safe; he never makes a false step; never\\nglides or slips from his path. I dare to say that if any river, any\\nfjord has to be crossed--and I have no doubt there will be many--you\\nwill see him enter the water without hesitation like an amphibious\\nanimal, and reach the opposite side in safety. We must not, however,\\nattempt to hurry him; we must allow him to have his own way, and I\\nwill undertake to say that between us we shall do our ten leagues a\\nday.\"\\n\\n\"We may do so,\" was my reply, \"but what about our worthy guide?\"\\n\\n\"I have not the slightest anxiety about him: that sort of people go\\nahead without knowing even what they are about. Look at Hans. He moves\\nso little that it is impossible for him to become fatigued. Besides, if\\nhe were to complain of weariness, he could have the loan of my horse. I\\nshould have a violent attack of the cramp if I were not to have some\\nsort of exercise. My arms are right--but my legs are getting a little\\nstiff.\"\\n\\nAll this while we were advancing at a rapid pace. The country we had\\nreached was already nearly a desert. Here and there could be seen an\\nisolated farm, some solitary bur, or Icelandic house, built of wood,\\nearth, fragments of lava--looking like beggars on the highway of life.\\nThese wretched and miserable huts excited in us such pity that we felt\\nhalf disposed to leave alms at every door. In this country there are no\\nroads, paths are nearly unknown, and vegetation, poor as it was, slowly\\nas it reached perfection, soon obliterated all traces of the few\\ntravelers who passed from place to place.\\n\\nNevertheless, this division of the province, situated only a few miles\\nfrom the capital, is considered one of the best cultivated and most\\nthickly peopled in all Iceland. What, then, must be the state of the\\nless known and more distant parts of the island? After traveling fully\\nhalf a Danish mile, we had met neither a farmer at the door of his hut,\\nnor even a wandering shepherd with his wild and savage flock.\\n\\nA few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally. What, then, must\\nwe expect when we come to the upheaved regions--to the districts broken\\nand roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions?\\n\\nWe were to learn this all in good time. I saw, however, on consulting\\nthe map, that we avoided a good deal of this rough country, by following\\nthe winding and desolate shores of the sea. In reality, the great\\nvolcanic movement of the island, and all its attendant phenomena, are\\nconcentrated in the interior of the island; there, horizontal layers or\\nstrata of rocks, piled one upon the other, eruptions of basaltic origin,\\nand streams of lava, have given this country a kind of supernatural\\nreputation.\\n\\nLittle did I expect, however, the spectacle which awaited us when we\\nreached the peninsula of Sneffels, where agglomerations of nature\\'s\\nruins form a kind of terrible chaos.\\n\\nSome two hours or more after we had left the city of Reykjavik, we\\nreached the little town called Aoalkirkja, or the principal church. It\\nconsists simply of a few houses--not what in England or Germany we\\nshould call a hamlet.\\n\\nHans stopped here one half hour. He shared our frugal breakfast,\\nanswered Yes, and No to my uncle\\'s questions as to the nature of the\\nroad, and at last when asked where we were to pass the night was as\\nlaconic as usual.\\n\\n\"Gardar!\" was his one-worded reply.\\n\\nI took occasion to consult the map, to see where Gardar was to be found.\\nAfter looking keenly I found a small town of that name on the borders of\\nthe Hvalfjord, about four miles from Reykjavik. I pointed this out to my\\nuncle, who made a very energetic grimace.\\n\\n\"Only four miles out of twenty-two? Why it is only a little walk.\"\\n\\nHe was about to make some energetic observation to the guide, but Hans,\\nwithout taking the slightest notice of him, went in front of the horses,\\nand walked ahead with the same imperturbable phlegm he had always\\nexhibited.\\n\\nThree hours later, still traveling over those apparently interminable\\nand sandy prairies, we were compelled to go round the Kollafjord, an\\neasier and shorter cut than crossing the gulfs. Shortly after we entered\\na place of communal jurisdiction called Ejulberg, and the clock of which\\nwould then have struck twelve, if any Icelandic church had been rich\\nenough to possess so valuable and useful an article. These sacred\\nedifices are, however, very much like these people, who do without\\nwatches--and never miss them.\\n\\nHere the horses were allowed to take some rest and refreshment, then\\nfollowing a narrow strip of shore between high rocks and the sea, they\\ntook us without further halt to the Aoalkirkja of Brantar, and after\\nanother mile to Saurboer Annexia, a chapel of ease, situated on the\\nsouthern bank of the Hvalfjord.\\n\\nIt was four o\\'clock in the evening and we had traveled four Danish\\nmiles, about equal to twenty English.\\n\\nThe fjord was in this place about half a mile in width. The sweeping and\\nbroken waves came rolling in upon the pointed rocks; the gulf was\\nsurrounded by rocky walls--a mighty cliff, three thousand feet in\\nheight, remarkable for its brown strata, separated here and there by\\nbeds of tufa of a reddish hue. Now, whatever may have been the\\nintelligence of our horses, I had not the slightest reliance upon them,\\nas a means of crossing a stormy arm of the sea. To ride over salt water\\nupon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd.\\n\\n\"If they are really intelligent,\" I said to myself, \"they will certainly\\nnot make the attempt. In any case, I shall trust rather to my own\\nintelligence than theirs.\"\\n\\nBut my uncle was in no humor to wait. He dug his heels into the sides of\\nhis steed, and made for the shore. His horse went to the very edge of\\nthe water, sniffed at the approaching wave and retreated.\\n\\nMy uncle, who was, sooth to say, quite as obstinate as the beast he\\nbestrode, insisted on his making the desired advance. This attempt was\\nfollowed by a new refusal on the part of the horse which quietly shook\\nhis head. This demonstration of rebellion was followed by a volley of\\nwords and a stout application of whipcord; also followed by kicks on the\\npart of the horse, which threw its head and heels upwards and tried to\\nthrow his rider. At length the sturdy little pony, spreading out his\\nlegs, in a stiff and ludicrous attitude, got from under the Professor\\'s\\nlegs, and left him standing, with both feet on a separate stone, like\\nthe Colossus of Rhodes.\\n\\n\"Wretched animal!\" cried my uncle, suddenly transformed into a foot\\npassenger--and as angry and ashamed as a dismounted cavalry officer on\\nthe field of battle.\\n\\n\"Farja,\" said the guide, tapping him familiarly on the shoulder.\\n\\n\"What, a ferry boat!\"\\n\\n\"Der,\" answered Hans, pointing to where lay the boat in\\nquestion--\"there.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" I cried, quite delighted with the information; \"so it is.\"\\n\\n\"Why did you not say so before,\" cried my uncle; \"why not start at\\nonce?\"\\n\\n\"Tidvatten,\" said the guide.\\n\\n\"What does he say?\" I asked, considerably puzzled by the delay and the\\ndialogue.\\n\\n\"He says tide,\" replied my uncle, translating the Danish word for my\\ninformation.\\n\\n\"Of course I understand--we must wait till the tide serves.\"\\n\\n\"For bida?\" asked my uncle.\\n\\n\"Ja,\" replied Hans.\\n\\nMy uncle frowned, stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where\\nthe boat lay.\\n\\nI thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting,\\nbefore crossing the fjord, for that moment when the sea at its highest\\npoint is in a state of slack water. As neither the ebb nor flow can then\\nbe felt, the ferry boat was in no danger of being carried out to sea, or\\ndashed upon the rocky coast.\\n\\nThe favorable moment did not come until six o\\'clock in the evening. Then\\nmy uncle, myself, and guide, two boatmen and the four horses got into a\\nvery awkward flat-bottom boat. Accustomed as I had been to the steam\\nferry boats of the Elbe, I found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry\\nmeans of locomotion. We were more than an hour in crossing the fjord;\\nbut at length the passage was concluded without accident.\\n\\nHalf an hour later we reached Gardar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\nTRAVELING IN ICELAND\\n\\n\\nIt ought, one would have thought, to have been night, even in the\\nsixty-fifth parallel of latitude; but still the nocturnal illumination\\ndid not surprise me. For in Iceland, during the months of June and July,\\nthe sun never sets.\\n\\nThe temperature, however, was very much lower than I expected. I was\\ncold, but even that did not affect me so much as ravenous hunger.\\nWelcome indeed, therefore, was the hut which hospitably opened its doors\\nto us.\\n\\nIt was merely the house of a peasant, but in the matter of hospitality,\\nit was worthy of being the palace of a king. As we alighted at the door\\nthe master of the house came forward, held out his hand, and without any\\nfurther ceremony, signaled to us to follow him.\\n\\nWe followed him, for to accompany him was impossible. A long, narrow,\\ngloomy passage led into the interior of this habitation, made from beams\\nroughly squared by the ax. This passage gave ingress to every room. The\\nchambers were four in number--the kitchen, the workshop, where the\\nweaving was carried on, the general sleeping chamber of the family, and\\nthe best room, to which strangers were especially invited. My uncle,\\nwhose lofty stature had not been taken into consideration when the house\\nwas built, contrived to knock his head against the beams of the roof.\\n\\nWe were introduced into our chamber, a kind of large room with a hard\\nearthen floor, and lighted by a window, the panes of which were made of\\na sort of parchment from the intestines of sheep--very far from\\ntransparent.\\n\\nThe bedding was composed of dry hay thrown into two long red wooden\\nboxes, ornamented with sentences painted in Icelandic. I really had no\\nidea that we should be made so comfortable. There was one objection to\\nthe house, and that was, the very powerful odor of dried fish, of\\nmacerated meat, and of sour milk, which three fragrances combined did\\nnot at all suit my olfactory nerves.\\n\\nAs soon as we had freed ourselves from our heavy traveling costume, the\\nvoice of our host was heard calling to us to come into the kitchen, the\\nonly room in which the Icelanders ever make any fire, no matter how cold\\nit may be.\\n\\nMy uncle, nothing loath, hastened to obey this hospitable and friendly\\ninvitation. I followed.\\n\\nThe kitchen chimney was made on an antique model. A large stone standing\\nin the middle of the room was the fireplace; above, in the roof, was a\\nhole for the smoke to pass through. This apartment was kitchen, parlor\\nand dining room all in one.\\n\\nOn our entrance, our worthy host, as if he had not seen us before,\\nadvanced ceremoniously, uttered a word which means \"be happy,\" and then\\nkissed both of us on the cheek.\\n\\nHis wife followed, pronounced the same word, with the same ceremonial,\\nthen the husband and wife, placing their right hands upon their hearts,\\nbowed profoundly.\\n\\nThis excellent Icelandic woman was the mother of nineteen children, who,\\nlittle and big, rolled, crawled, and walked about in the midst of\\nvolumes of smoke arising from the angular fireplace in the middle of the\\nroom. Every now and then I could see a fresh white head, and a slightly\\nmelancholy expression of countenance, peering at me through the vapor.\\n\\nBoth my uncle and myself, however, were very friendly with the whole\\nparty, and before we were aware of it, there were three or four of these\\nlittle ones on our shoulders, as many on our boxes, and the rest hanging\\nabout our legs. Those who could speak kept crying out saellvertu in\\nevery possible and impossible key. Those who did not speak only made all\\nthe more noise.\\n\\nThis concert was interrupted by the announcement of supper. At this\\nmoment our worthy guide, the eider-duck hunter, came in after seeing to\\nthe feeding and stabling of the horses--which consisted in letting them\\nloose to browse on the stunted green of the Icelandic prairies. There\\nwas little for them to eat, but moss and some very dry and innutritious\\ngrass; next day they were ready before the door, some time before we\\nwere.\\n\\n\"Welcome,\" said Hans.\\n\\nThen tranquilly, with the air of an automaton, without any more\\nexpression in one kiss than another, he embraced the host and hostess\\nand their nineteen children.\\n\\nThis ceremony concluded to the satisfaction of all parties, we all sat\\ndown to table, that is twenty-four of us, somewhat crowded. Those who\\nwere best off had only two juveniles on their knees.\\n\\nAs soon, however, as the inevitable soup was placed on the table, the\\nnatural taciturnity, common even to Icelandic babies, prevailed over all\\nelse. Our host filled our plates with a portion of lichen soup of\\nIceland moss, of by no means disagreeable flavor, an enormous lump of\\nfish floating in sour butter. After that there came some skyr, a kind of\\ncurds and whey, served with biscuits and juniper-berry juice. To drink,\\nwe had blanda, skimmed milk with water. I was hungry, so hungry, that by\\nway of dessert I finished up with a basin of thick oaten porridge.\\n\\nAs soon as the meal was over, the children disappeared, whilst the grown\\npeople sat around the fireplace, on which was placed turf, heather, cow\\ndung and dried fish-bones. As soon as everybody was sufficiently warm, a\\ngeneral dispersion took place, all retiring to their respective couches.\\nOur hostess offered to pull off our stockings and trousers, according to\\nthe custom of the country, but as we graciously declined to be so\\nhonored, she left us to our bed of dry fodder.\\n\\nNext day, at five in the morning, we took our leave of these hospitable\\npeasants. My uncle had great difficulty in making them accept a\\nsufficient and proper remuneration.\\n\\nHans then gave the signal to start.\\n\\nWe had scarcely got a hundred yards from Gardar, when the character of\\nthe country changed. The soil began to be marshy and boggy, and less\\nfavorable to progress. To the right, the range of mountains was\\nprolonged indefinitely like a great system of natural fortifications, of\\nwhich we skirted the glacis. We met with numerous streams and rivulets\\nwhich it was necessary to ford, and that without wetting our baggage. As\\nwe advanced, the deserted appearance increased, and yet now and then we\\ncould see human shadows flitting in the distance. When a sudden turn of\\nthe track brought us within easy reach of one of these specters, I felt\\na sudden impulse of disgust at the sight of a swollen head, with shining\\nskin, utterly without hair, and whose repulsive and revolting wounds\\ncould be seen through his rags. The unhappy wretches never came forward\\nto beg; on the contrary, they ran away; not so quick, however, but that\\nHans was able to salute them with the universal saellvertu.\\n\\n\"Spetelsk,\" said he.\\n\\n\"A leper,\" explained my uncle.\\n\\nThe very sound of such a word caused a feeling of repulsion. The\\nhorrible affliction known as leprosy, which has almost vanished before\\nthe effects of modern science, is common in Iceland. It is not\\ncontagious but hereditary, so that marriage is strictly prohibited to\\nthese unfortunate creatures.\\n\\nThese poor lepers did not tend to enliven our journey, the scene of\\nwhich was inexpressibly sad and lonely. The very last tufts of grassy\\nvegetation appeared to die at our feet. Not a tree was to be seen,\\nexcept a few stunted willows about as big as blackberry bushes. Now and\\nthen we watched a falcon soaring in the grey and misty air, taking his\\nflight towards warmer and sunnier regions. I could not help feeling a\\nsense of melancholy come over me. I sighed for my own Native Land, and\\nwished to be back with Gretchen.\\n\\nWe were compelled to cross several little fjords, and at last came to a\\nreal gulf. The tide was at its height, and we were able to go over at\\nonce, and reach the hamlet of Alftanes, about a mile farther.\\n\\nThat evening, after fording the Alfa and the Heta, two rivers rich in\\ntrout and pike, we were compelled to pass the night in a deserted house,\\nworthy of being haunted by all the fays of Scandinavian mythology. The\\nKing of Cold had taken up his residence there, and made us feel his\\npresence all night.\\n\\nThe following day was remarkable by its lack of any particular\\nincidents. Always the same damp and swampy soil; the same dreary\\nuniformity; the same sad and monotonous aspect of scenery. In the\\nevening, having accomplished the half of our projected journey, we slept\\nat the Annexia of Krosolbt.\\n\\nFor a whole mile we had under our feet nothing but lava. This\\ndisposition of the soil is called <i>hraun</i>: the crumbled lava on the\\nsurface was in some instances like ship cables stretched out\\nhorizontally, in others coiled up in heaps; an immense field of lava\\ncame from the neighboring mountains, all extinct volcanoes, but whose\\nremains showed what once they had been. Here and there could be made out\\nthe steam from hot water springs.\\n\\nThere was no time, however, for us to take more than a cursory view of\\nthese phenomena. We had to go forward with what speed we might. Soon the\\nsoft and swampy soil again appeared under the feet of our horses, while\\nat every hundred yards we came upon one or more small lakes. Our journey\\nwas now in a westerly direction; we had, in fact, swept round the great\\nbay of Faxa, and the twin white summits of Sneffels rose to the clouds\\nat a distance of less than five miles.\\n\\nThe horses now advanced rapidly. The accidents and difficulties of the\\nsoil no longer checked them. I confess that fatigue began to tell\\nseverely upon me; but my uncle was as firm and as hard as he had been on\\nthe first day. I could not help admiring both the excellent Professor\\nand the worthy guide; for they appeared to regard this rugged expedition\\nas a mere walk!\\n\\nOn Saturday, the 20th June, at six o\\'clock in the evening, we reached\\nBudir, a small town picturesquely situated on the shore of the ocean;\\nand here the guide asked for his money. My uncle settled with him\\nimmediately. It was now the family of Hans himself, that is to say, his\\nuncles, his cousins--german, who offered us hospitality. We were\\nexceedingly well received, and without taking too much advantage of the\\ngoodness of these worthy people, I should have liked very much to have\\nrested with them after the fatigues of the journey. But my uncle, who\\ndid not require rest, had no idea of anything of the kind; and despite\\nthe fact that next day was Sunday, I was compelled once more to mount my\\nsteed.\\n\\nThe soil was again affected by the neighborhood of the mountains, whose\\ngranite peered out of the ground like tops of an old oak. We were\\nskirting the enormous base of the mighty volcano. My uncle never took\\nhis eyes from off it; he could not keep from gesticulating, and looking\\nat it with a kind of sullen defiance as much as to say \"That is the\\ngiant I have made up my mind to conquer.\"\\n\\nAfter four hours of steady traveling, the horses stopped of themselves\\nbefore the door of the presbytery of Stapi.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\nWE REACH MOUNT SNEFFELS--THE \"REYKIR\"\\n\\n\\nStapi is a town consisting of thirty huts, built on a large plain of\\nlava, exposed to the rays of the sun, reflected from the volcano. It\\nstretches its humble tenements along the end of a little fjord,\\nsurrounded by a basaltic wall of the most singular character.\\n\\nBasalt is a brown rock of igneous origin. It assumes regular forms,\\nwhich astonish by their singular appearance. Here we found Nature\\nproceeding geometrically, and working quite after a human fashion, as if\\nshe had employed the plummet line, the compass and the rule. If\\nelsewhere she produces grand artistic effects by piling up huge masses\\nwithout order or connection--if elsewhere we see truncated cones,\\nimperfect pyramids, with an odd succession of lines; here, as if wishing\\nto give a lesson in regularity, and preceding the architects of the\\nearly ages, she has erected a severe order of architecture, which\\nneither the splendors of Babylon nor the marvels of Greece ever\\nsurpassed.\\n\\nI had often heard of the Giant\\'s Causeway in Ireland, and of Fingal\\'s\\nCave in one of the Hebrides, but the grand spectacle of a real basaltic\\nformation had never yet come before my eyes.\\n\\nThis at Stapi gave us an idea of one in all its wonderful beauty and\\ngrace.\\n\\nThe wall of the fjord, like nearly the whole of the peninsula, consisted\\nof a series of vertical columns, in height about thirty feet. These\\nupright pillars of stone, of the finest proportions, supported an\\narchivault of horizontal columns which formed a kind of half-vaulted\\nroof above the sea. At certain intervals, and below this natural basin,\\nthe eye was pleased and surprised by the sight of oval openings through\\nwhich the outward waves came thundering in volleys of foam. Some banks\\nof basalt, torn from their fastenings by the fury of the waves, lay\\nscattered on the ground like the ruins of an ancient temple--ruins\\neternally young, over which the storms of ages swept without producing\\nany perceptible effect!\\n\\nThis was the last stage of our journey. Hans had brought us along with\\nfidelity and intelligence, and I began to feel somewhat more comfortable\\nwhen I reflected that he was to accompany us still farther on our way.\\n\\nWhen we halted before the house of the Rector, a small and incommodious\\ncabin, neither handsome nor more comfortable than those of his\\nneighbors, I saw a man in the act of shoeing a horse, a hammer in his\\nhand, and a leathern apron tied round his waist.\\n\\n\"Be happy,\" said the eider-down hunter, using his national salutation in\\nhis own language.\\n\\n\"God dag--good day!\" replied the former, in excellent Danish.\\n\\n\"Kyrkoherde,\" cried Hans, turning round and introducing him to my uncle.\\n\\n\"The Rector,\" repeated the worthy Professor; \"it appears, my dear Harry,\\nthat this worthy man is the Rector, and is not above doing his own\\nwork.\"\\n\\nDuring the speaking of these words the guide intimated to the Kyrkoherde\\nwhat was the true state of the case. The good man, ceasing from his\\noccupation, gave a kind of halloo, upon which a tall woman, almost a\\ngiantess, came out of the hut. She was at least six feet high, which in\\nthat region is something considerable.\\n\\nMy first impression was one of horror. I thought she had come to give us\\nthe Icelandic kiss. I had, however, nothing to fear, for she did not\\neven show much inclination to receive us into her house.\\n\\nThe room devoted to strangers appeared to me to be by far the worst in\\nthe presbytery; it was narrow, dirty and offensive. There was, however,\\nno choice about the matter. The Rector had no notion of practicing the\\nusual cordial and antique hospitality. Far from it. Before the day was\\nover, I found we had to deal with a blacksmith, a fisherman, a hunter, a\\ncarpenter, anything but a clergyman. It must be said in his favor that\\nwe had caught him on a weekday; probably he appeared to greater\\nadvantage on the Sunday.\\n\\nThese poor priests receive from the Danish Government a most\\nridiculously inadequate salary, and collect one quarter of the tithe of\\ntheir parish--not more than sixty marks current, or about L3 10s.\\nsterling. Hence the necessity of working to live. In truth, we soon\\nfound that our host did not count civility among the cardinal virtues.\\n\\nMy uncle soon became aware of the kind of man he had to deal with.\\nInstead of a worthy and learned scholar, he found a dull ill-mannered\\npeasant. He therefore resolved to start on his great expedition as soon\\nas possible. He did not care about fatigue, and resolved to spend a few\\ndays in the mountains.\\n\\nThe preparations for our departure were made the very next day after our\\narrival at Stapi; Hans now hired three Icelanders to take the place of\\nthe horses--which could no longer carry our luggage. When, however,\\nthese worthy islanders had reached the bottom of the crater, they were\\nto go back and leave us to ourselves. This point was settled before they\\nwould agree to start.\\n\\nOn this occasion, my uncle partly confided in Hans, the eider-duck\\nhunter, and gave him to understand that it was his intention to continue\\nhis exploration of the volcano to the last possible limits.\\n\\nHans listened calmly, and then nodded his head. To go there, or\\nelsewhere, to bury himself in the bowels of the earth, or to travel over\\nits summits, was all the same to him! As for me, amused and occupied by\\nthe incidents of travel, I had begun to forget the inevitable future;\\nbut now I was once more destined to realize the actual state of affairs.\\nWhat was to be done? Run away? But if I really had intended to leave\\nProfessor Hardwigg to his fate, it should have been at Hamburg and not\\nat the foot of Sneffels.\\n\\nOne idea, above all others, began to trouble me: a very terrible idea,\\nand one calculated to shake the nerves of a man even less sensitive than\\nmyself.\\n\\n\"Let us consider the matter,\" I said to myself; \"we are going to ascend\\nthe Sneffels mountain. Well and good. We are about to pay a visit to the\\nvery bottom of the crater. Good, still. Others have done it and did not\\nperish from that course.\\n\\n\"That, however, is not the whole matter to be considered. If a road does\\nreally present itself by which to descend into the dark and\\nsubterraneous bowels of Mother Earth, if this thrice unhappy Saknussemm\\nhas really told the truth, we shall be most certainly lost in the midst\\nof the labyrinth of subterraneous galleries of the volcano. Now, we have\\nno evidence to prove that Sneffels is really extinct. What proof have we\\nthat an eruption is not shortly about to take place? Because the monster\\nhas slept soundly since 1219, does it follow that he is never to wake?\\n\\n\"If he does wake what is to become of us?\"\\n\\nThese were questions worth thinking about, and upon them I reflected\\nlong and deeply. I could not lie down in search of sleep without\\ndreaming of eruptions. The more I thought, the more I objected to be\\nreduced to the state of dross and ashes.\\n\\nI could stand it no longer; so I determined at last to submit the whole\\ncase to my uncle, in the most adroit manner possible, and under the form\\nof some totally irreconcilable hypothesis.\\n\\nI sought him. I laid before him my fears, and then drew back in order to\\nlet him get his passion over at his ease.\\n\\n\"I have been thinking about the matter,\" he said, in the quietest tone\\nin the world.\\n\\nWhat did he mean? Was he at last about to listen to the voice of reason?\\nDid he think of suspending his projects? It was almost too much\\nhappiness to be true.\\n\\nI however made no remark. In fact, I was only too anxious not to\\ninterrupt him, and allowed him to reflect at his leisure. After some\\nmoments he spoke out.\\n\\n\"I have been thinking about the matter,\" he resumed. \"Ever since we have\\nbeen at Stapi, my mind has been almost solely occupied with the grave\\nquestion which has been submitted to me by yourself--for nothing would\\nbe unwiser and more inconsistent than to act with imprudence.\"\\n\\n\"I heartily agree with you, my dear uncle,\" was my somewhat hopeful\\nrejoinder.\\n\\n\"It is now six hundred years since Sneffels has spoken, but though now\\nreduced to a state of utter silence, he may speak again. New volcanic\\neruptions are always preceded by perfectly well-known phenomena. I have\\nclosely examined the inhabitants of this region; I have carefully\\nstudied the soil, and I beg to tell you emphatically, my dear Harry,\\nthere will be no eruption at present.\"\\n\\nAs I listened to his positive affirmations, I was stupefied and could\\nsay nothing.\\n\\n\"I see you doubt my word,\" said my uncle; \"follow me.\"\\n\\nI obeyed mechanically.\\n\\nLeaving the presbytery, the Professor took a road through an opening in\\nthe basaltic rock, which led far away from the sea. We were soon in open\\ncountry, if we could give such a name to a place all covered with\\nvolcanic deposits. The whole land seemed crushed under the weight of\\nenormous stones--of trap, of basalt, of granite, of lava, and of all\\nother volcanic substances.\\n\\nI could see many spouts of steam rising in the air. These white vapors,\\ncalled in the Icelandic language \"reykir,\" come from hot water\\nfountains, and indicate by their violence the volcanic activity of the\\nsoil. Now the sight of these appeared to justify my apprehension. I was,\\ntherefore, all the more surprised and mortified when my uncle thus\\naddressed me.\\n\\n\"You see all this smoke, Harry, my boy?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as long as you see them thus, you have nothing to fear from the\\nvolcano.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be?\"\\n\\n\"Be careful to remember this,\" continued the Professor. \"At the approach\\nof an eruption these spouts of vapor redouble their activity--to\\ndisappear altogether during the period of volcanic eruption; for the\\nelastic fluids, no longer having the necessary tension, seek refuge in\\nthe interior of the crater, instead of escaping through the fissures of\\nthe earth. If, then, the steam remains in its normal or habitual state,\\nif their energy does not increase, and if you add to this, the remark\\nthat the wind is not replaced by heavy atmospheric pressure and dead\\ncalm, you may be quite sure that there is no fear of any immediate\\neruption.\"\\n\\n\"But--\"\\n\\n\"Enough, my boy. When science has sent forth her fiat--it is only to\\nhear and obey.\"\\n\\nI came back to the house quite downcast and disappointed. My uncle had\\ncompletely defeated me with his scientific arguments. Nevertheless, I\\nhad still one hope, and that was, when once we were at the bottom of the\\ncrater, that it would be impossible in default of a gallery or tunnel,\\nto descend any deeper; and this, despite all the learned Saknussemms in\\nthe world.\\n\\nI passed the whole of the following night with a nightmare on my chest!\\nand, after unheard-of miseries and tortures, found myself in the very\\ndepths of the earth, from which I was suddenly launched into planetary\\nspace, under the form of an eruptive rock!\\n\\nNext day, June 23d, Hans calmly awaited us outside the presbytery with\\nhis three companions loaded with provisions, tools, and instruments. Two\\niron-shod poles, two guns, and two large game bags, were reserved for my\\nuncle and myself. Hans, who was a man who never forgot even the minutest\\nprecautions, had added to our baggage a large skin full of water, as an\\naddition to our gourds. This assured us water for eight days.\\n\\nIt was nine o\\'clock in the morning when we were quite ready. The rector\\nand his huge wife or servant, I never knew which, stood at the door to\\nsee us off. They appeared to be about to inflict on us the usual final\\nkiss of the Icelanders. To our supreme astonishment their adieu took the\\nshape of a formidable bill, in which they even counted the use of the\\npastoral house, really and truly the most abominable and dirty place I\\never was in. The worthy couple cheated and robbed us like a Swiss\\ninnkeeper, and made us feel, by the sum we had to pay, the splendors of\\ntheir hospitality.\\n\\nMy uncle, however, paid without bargaining. A man who had made up his\\nmind to undertake a voyage into the Interior of the Earth, is not the\\nman to haggle over a few miserable rix-dollars.\\n\\nThis important matter settled, Hans gave the signal for departure, and\\nsome few moments later we had left Stapi.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\nTHE ASCENT OF MOUNT SNEFFELS\\n\\n\\nThe huge volcano which was the first stage of our daring experiment is\\nabove five thousand feet high. Sneffels is the termination of a long\\nrange of volcanic mountains, of a different character to the system of\\nthe island itself. One of its peculiarities is its two huge pointed\\nsummits. From whence we started it was impossible to make out the real\\noutlines of the peak against the grey field of sky. All we could\\ndistinguish was a vast dome of white, which fell downwards from the head\\nof the giant.\\n\\nThe commencement of the great undertaking filled me with awe. Now that\\nwe had actually started, I began to believe in the reality of the\\nundertaking!\\n\\nOur party formed quite a procession. We walked in single file, preceded\\nby Hans, the imperturbable eider-duck hunter. He calmly led us by narrow\\npaths where two persons could by no possibility walk abreast.\\nConversation was wholly impossible. We had all the more opportunity to\\nreflect and admire the awful grandeur of the scene around.\\n\\nBeyond the extraordinary basaltic wall of the fjord of Stapi we found\\nourselves making our way through fibrous turf, over which grew a scanty\\nvegetation of grass, the residuum of the ancient vegetation of the\\nswampy peninsula. The vast mass of this combustible, the field of which\\nas yet is utterly unexplored, would suffice to warm Iceland for a whole\\ncentury. This mighty turf pit, measured from the bottom of certain\\nravines, is often not less than seventy feet deep, and presents to the\\neye the view of successive layers of black burned-up rocky detritus,\\nseparated by thin streaks of porous sandstone.\\n\\nThe grandeur of the spectacle was undoubted, as well as its arid and\\ndeserted air.\\n\\nAs a true nephew of the great Professor Hardwigg, and despite my\\npreoccupation and doleful fears of what was to come, I observed with\\ngreat interest the vast collection of mineralogical curiosities spread\\nout before me in this vast museum of natural history. Looking back to my\\nrecent studies, I went over in thought the whole geological history of\\nIceland.\\n\\nThis extraordinary and curious island must have made its appearance from\\nout of the great world of waters at a comparatively recent date. Like\\nthe coral islands of the Pacific, it may, for aught we know, be still\\nrising by slow and imperceptible degrees.\\n\\nIf this really be the case, its origin can be attributed to only one\\ncause--that of the continued action of subterranean fires.\\n\\nThis was a happy thought.\\n\\nIf so, if this were true, away with the theories of Sir Humphry Davy;\\naway with the authority of the parchment of Arne Saknussemm; the\\nwonderful pretensions to discovery on the part of my uncle--and to our\\njourney!\\n\\nAll must end in smoke.\\n\\nCharmed with the idea, I began more carefully to look about me. A\\nserious study of the soil was necessary to negative or confirm my\\nhypothesis. I took in every item of what I saw, and I began to\\ncomprehend the succession of phenomena which had preceded its formation.\\n\\nIceland, being absolutely without sedimentary soil, is composed\\nexclusively of volcanic tufa; that is to say, of an agglomeration of\\nstones and of rocks of a porous texture. Long before the existence of\\nvolcanoes, it was composed of a solid body of massive trap rock lifted\\nbodily and slowly out of the sea, by the action of the centrifugal force\\nat work in the earth.\\n\\nThe internal fires, however, had not as yet burst their bounds and\\nflooded the exterior cake of Mother Earth with hot and raging lava.\\n\\nMy readers must excuse this brief and somewhat pedantic geological\\nlecture. But it is necessary to the complete understanding of what\\nfollows.\\n\\nAt a later period in the world\\'s history, a huge and mighty fissure\\nmust, reasoning by analogy, have been dug diagonally from the southwest\\nto the northeast of the island, through which by degrees flowed the\\nvolcanic crust. The great and wondrous phenomenon then went on without\\nviolence--the outpouring was enormous, and the seething fused matter,\\nejected from the bowels of the earth, spread slowly and peacefully in\\nthe form of vast level plains, or what are called mamelons or mounds.\\n\\nIt was at this epoch that the rocks called feldspars, syenites, and\\nporphyries appeared.\\n\\nBut as a natural consequence of this overflow, the depth of the island\\nincreased. It can readily be believed what an enormous quantity of\\nelastic fluids were piled up within its centre, when at last it afforded\\nno other openings, after the process of cooling the crust had taken\\nplace.\\n\\nAt length a time came when despite the enormous thickness and weight of\\nthe upper crust, the mechanical forces of the combustible gases below\\nbecame so great, that they actually upheaved the weighty back and made\\nfor themselves huge and gigantic shafts. Hence the volcanoes which\\nsuddenly arose through the upper crust, and next the craters, which\\nburst forth at the summit of these new creations.\\n\\nIt will be seen that the first phenomena in connection with the\\nformation of the island were simply eruptive; to these, however, shortly\\nsucceeded the volcanic phenomena.\\n\\nThrough the newly formed openings, escaped the marvelous mass of\\nbasaltic stones with which the plain we were now crossing was covered.\\nWe were trampling our way over heavy rocks of dark grey color, which,\\nwhile cooling, had been moulded into six-sided prisms. In the \"back\\ndistance\" we could see a number of flattened cones, which formerly were\\nso many fire-vomiting mouths.\\n\\nAfter the basaltic eruption was appeased and set at rest, the volcano,\\nthe force of which increased with that of the extinct craters, gave free\\npassage to the fiery overflow of lava, and to the mass of cinders and\\npumice stone, now scattered over the sides of the mountain, like\\ndisheveled hair on the shoulders of a Bacchante.\\n\\nHere, in a nutshell, I had the whole history of the phenomena from which\\nIceland arose. All take their rise in the fierce action of interior\\nfires, and to believe that the central mass did not remain in a state of\\nliquid fire, white hot, was simply and purely madness.\\n\\nThis being satisfactorily proved (Q.E.D.), what insensate folly to\\npretend to penetrate into the interior of the mighty earth!\\n\\nThis mental lecture delivered to myself while proceeding on a journey,\\ndid me good. I was quite reassured as to the fate of our enterprise; and\\ntherefore went, like a brave soldier mounting a bristling battery, to\\nthe assault of old Sneffels.\\n\\nAs we advanced, the road became every moment more difficult. The soil\\nwas broken and dangerous. The rocks broke and gave way under our feet,\\nand we had to be scrupulously careful in order to avoid dangerous and\\nconstant falls.\\n\\nHans advanced as calmly as if he had been walking over Salisbury Plain;\\nsometimes he would disappear behind huge blocks of stone, and we\\nmomentarily lost sight of him. There was a little period of anxiety and\\nthen there was a shrill whistle, just to tell us where to look for him.\\n\\nOccasionally he would take it into his head to stop to pick up lumps of\\nrock, and silently pile them up into small heaps, in order that we might\\nnot lose our way on our return.\\n\\nHe had no idea of the journey we were about to undertake.\\n\\nAt all events, the precaution was a good one; though how utterly useless\\nand unnecessary--but I must not anticipate.\\n\\nThree hours of terrible fatigue, walking incessantly, had only brought\\nus to the foot of the great mountain. This will give some notion of what\\nwe had still to undergo.\\n\\nSuddenly, however, Hans cried a halt--that is, he made signs to that\\neffect--and a summary kind of breakfast was laid out on the lava before\\nus. My uncle, who now was simply Professor Hardwigg, was so eager to\\nadvance, that he bolted his food like a greedy clown. This halt for\\nrefreshment was also a halt for repose. The Professor was therefore\\ncompelled to wait the good pleasure of his imperturbable guide, who did\\nnot give the signal for departure for a good hour.\\n\\nThe three Icelanders, who were as taciturn as their comrade, did not say\\na word; but went on eating and drinking very quietly and soberly.\\n\\nFrom this, our first real stage, we began to ascend the slopes of the\\nSneffels volcano. Its magnificent snowy nightcap, as we began to call\\nit, by an optical delusion very common in mountains, appeared to me to\\nbe close at hand; and yet how many long weary hours must elapse before\\nwe reached its summit. What unheard-of fatigue must we endure!\\n\\nThe stones on the mountain side, held together by no cement of soil,\\nbound together by no roots or creeping herbs, gave way continually under\\nour feet, and went rushing below into the plains, like a series of small\\navalanches.\\n\\nIn certain places the sides of this stupendous mountain were at an angle\\nso steep that it was impossible to climb upwards, and we were compelled\\nto get round these obstacles as best we might.\\n\\nThose who understand Alpine climbing will comprehend our difficulties.\\nOften we were obliged to help each other along by means of our climbing\\npoles.\\n\\nI must say this for my uncle, that he stuck as close to me as possible.\\nHe never lost sight of me, and on many occasions his arm supplied me\\nwith firm and solid support. He was strong, wiry, and apparently\\ninsensible to fatigue. Another great advantage with him was that he had\\nthe innate sentiment of equilibrium--for he never slipped or failed in\\nhis steps. The Icelanders, though heavily loaded, climbed with the\\nagility of mountaineers.\\n\\nLooking up, every now and then, at the height of the great volcano of\\nSneffels, it appeared to me wholly impossible to reach to the summit on\\nthat side; at all events, if the angle of inclination did not speedily\\nchange.\\n\\nFortunately, after an hour of unheard-of fatigues, and of gymnastic\\nexercises that would have been trying to an acrobat, we came to a vast\\nfield of ice, which wholly surrounded the bottom of the cone of the\\nvolcano. The natives called it the tablecloth, probably from some such\\nreason as the dwellers in the Cape of Good Hope call their mountain\\nTable Mountain, and their roads Table Bay.\\n\\nHere, to our mutual surprise, we found an actual flight of stone steps,\\nwhich wonderfully assisted our ascent. This singular flight of stairs\\nwas, like everything else, volcanic. It had been formed by one of those\\ntorrents of stones cast up by the eruptions, and of which the Icelandic\\nname is stina. If this singular torrent had not been checked in its\\ndescent by the peculiar shape of the flanks of the mountain, it would\\nhave swept into the sea, and would have formed new islands.\\n\\nSuch as it was, it served us admirably. The abrupt character of the\\nslopes momentarily increased, but these remarkable stone steps, a little\\nless difficult than those of the Egyptian pyramids, were the one simple\\nnatural means by which we were enabled to proceed.\\n\\nAbout seven in the evening of that day, after having clambered up two\\nthousand of these rough steps, we found ourselves overlooking a kind of\\nspur or projection of the mountain--a sort of buttress upon which the\\nconelike crater, properly so called, leaned for support.\\n\\nThe ocean lay beneath us at a depth of more than three thousand two\\nhundred feet--a grand and mighty spectacle. We had reached the region of\\neternal snows.\\n\\nThe cold was keen, searching and intense. The wind blew with\\nextraordinary violence. I was utterly exhausted.\\n\\nMy worthy uncle, the Professor, saw clearly that my legs refused further\\nservice, and that, in fact, I was utterly exhausted. Despite his hot and\\nfeverish impatience, he decided, with a sigh, upon a halt. He called the\\neider-duck hunter to his side. That worthy, however, shook his head.\\n\\n\"Ofvanfor,\" was his sole spoken reply.\\n\\n\"It appears,\" says my uncle with a woebegone look, \"that we must go\\nhigher.\"\\n\\nHe then turned to Hans, and asked him to give some reason for this\\ndecisive response.\\n\\n\"Mistour,\" replied the guide.\\n\\n\"Ja, mistour--yes, the mistour,\" cried one of the Icelandic guides in a\\nterrified tone.\\n\\nIt was the first time he had spoken.\\n\\n\"What does this mysterious word signify?\" I anxiously inquired.\\n\\n\"Look,\" said my uncle.\\n\\nI looked down upon the plain below, and I saw a vast, a prodigious\\nvolume of pulverized pumice stone, of sand, of dust, rising to the\\nheavens in the form of a mighty waterspout. It resembled the fearful\\nphenomenon of a similar character known to the travelers in the desert\\nof the great Sahara.\\n\\nThe wind was driving it directly towards that side of Sneffels on which\\nwe were perched. This opaque veil standing up between us and the sun\\nprojected a deep shadow on the flanks of the mountain. If this sand\\nspout broke over us, we must all be infallibly destroyed, crushed in its\\nfearful embraces. This extraordinary phenomenon, very common when the\\nwind shakes the glaciers, and sweeps over the arid plains, is in the\\nIcelandic tongue called \"mistour.\"\\n\\n\"Hastigt, hastigt!\" cried our guide.\\n\\nNow I certainly knew nothing of Danish, but I thoroughly understood that\\nhis gestures were meant to quicken us.\\n\\nThe guide turned rapidly in a direction which would take us to the back\\nof the crater, all the while ascending slightly.\\n\\nWe followed rapidly, despite our excessive fatigue.\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later Hans paused to enable us to look back. The\\nmighty whirlwind of sand was spreading up the slope of the mountain to\\nthe very spot where we had proposed to halt. Huge stones were caught up,\\ncast into the air, and thrown about as during an eruption. We were\\nhappily a little out of the direction of the wind, and therefore out of\\nreach of danger. But for the precaution and knowledge of our guide, our\\ndislocated bodies, our crushed and broken limbs, would have been cast to\\nthe wind, like dust from some unknown meteor.\\n\\nHans, however, did not think it prudent to pass the night on the bare\\nside of the cone. We therefore continued our journey in a zigzag\\ndirection. The fifteen hundred feet which remained to be accomplished\\ntook us at least five hours. The turnings and windings, the\\nno-thoroughfares, the marches and marches, turned that insignificant\\ndistance into at least three leagues. I never felt such misery, fatigue\\nand exhaustion in my life. I was ready to faint from hunger and cold.\\nThe rarefied air at the same time painfully acted upon my lungs.\\n\\nAt last, when I thought myself at my last gasp, about eleven at night,\\nit being in that region quite dark, we reached the summit of Mount\\nSneffels! It was in an awful mood of mind, that despite my fatigue,\\nbefore I descended into the crater which was to shelter us for the\\nnight, I paused to behold the sun rise at midnight on the very day of\\nits lowest declension, and enjoyed the spectacle of its ghastly pale\\nrays cast upon the isle which lay sleeping at our feet!\\n\\nI no longer wondered at people traveling all the way from England to\\nNorway to behold this magical and wondrous spectacle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nTHE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS\\n\\n\\nOur supper was eaten with ease and rapidity, after which everybody did\\nthe best he could for himself within the hollow of the crater. The bed\\nwas hard, the shelter unsatisfactory, the situation painful--lying in\\nthe open air, five thousand feet above the level of the sea!\\n\\nNevertheless, it has seldom happened to me to sleep so well as I did on\\nthat particular night. I did not even dream. So much for the effects of\\nwhat my uncle called \"wholesome fatigue.\"\\n\\nNext day, when we awoke under the rays of a bright and glorious sun, we\\nwere nearly frozen by the keen air. I left my granite couch and made one\\nof the party to enjoy a view of the magnificent spectacle which\\ndeveloped itself, panorama-like, at our feet.\\n\\nI stood upon the lofty summit of Mount Sneffels\\' southern peak. Thence I\\nwas able to obtain a view of the greater part of the island. The optical\\ndelusion, common to all lofty heights, raised the shores of the island,\\nwhile the central portions appeared depressed. It was by no means too\\ngreat a flight of fancy to believe that a giant picture was stretched\\nout before me. I could see the deep valleys that crossed each other in\\nevery direction. I could see precipices looking like sides of wells,\\nlakes that seemed to be changed into ponds, ponds that looked like\\npuddles, and rivers that were transformed into petty brooks. To my right\\nwere glaciers upon glaciers, and multiplied peaks, topped with light\\nclouds of smoke.\\n\\nThe undulation of these infinite numbers of mountains, whose snowy\\nsummits make them look as if covered by foam, recalled to my remembrance\\nthe surface of a storm-beaten ocean. If I looked towards the west, the\\nocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur, a continuation as it\\nwere, of these fleecy hilltops.\\n\\nWhere the earth ended and the sea began it was impossible for the eye to\\ndistinguish.\\n\\nI soon felt that strange and mysterious sensation which is awakened in\\nthe mind when looking down from lofty hilltops, and now I was able to do\\nso without any feeling of nervousness, having fortunately hardened\\nmyself to that kind of sublime contemplation.\\n\\nI wholly forgot who I was, and where I was. I became intoxicated with a\\nsense of lofty sublimity, without thought of the abysses into which my\\ndaring was soon about to plunge me. I was presently, however, brought\\nback to the realities of life by the arrival of the Professor and Hans,\\nwho joined me upon the lofty summit of the peak.\\n\\nMy uncle, turning in a westerly direction, pointed out to me a light\\ncloud of vapor, a kind of haze, with a faint outline of land rising out\\nof the waters.\\n\\n\"Greenland!\" said he.\\n\\n\"Greenland?\" cried I in reply.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" continued my uncle, who always when explaining anything spoke as\\nif he were in a professor\\'s chair; \"we are not more than thirty-five\\nleagues distant from that wonderful land. When the great annual breakup\\nof the ice takes place, white bears come over to Iceland, carried by the\\nfloating masses of ice from the north. This, however, is a matter of\\nlittle consequence. We are now on the summit of the great, the\\ntranscendent Sneffels, and here are its two peaks, north and south. Hans\\nwill tell you the name by which the people of Iceland call that on which\\nwe stand.\"\\n\\nMy uncle turned to the imperturbable guide, who nodded, and spoke as\\nusual--one word.\\n\\n\"Scartaris.\"\\n\\nMy uncle looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance.\\n\\n\"A crater,\" he said, \"you hear?\"\\n\\nI did hear, but I was totally unable to make reply.\\n\\nThe crater of Mount Sneffels represented an inverted cone, the gaping\\norifice apparently half a mile across; the depth indefinite feet.\\nConceive what this hole must have been like when full of flame and\\nthunder and lightning. The bottom of the funnel-shaped hollow was about\\nfive hundred feet in circumference, by which it will be seen that the\\nslope from the summit to the bottom was very gradual, and we were\\ntherefore clearly able to get there without much fatigue or difficulty.\\nInvoluntarily, I compared this crater to an enormous loaded cannon; and\\nthe comparison completely terrified me.\\n\\n\"To descend into the interior of a cannon,\" I thought to myself, \"when\\nperhaps it is loaded, and will go off at the least shock, is the act of\\na madman.\"\\n\\nBut there was no longer any opportunity for me to hesitate. Hans, with a\\nperfectly calm and indifferent air, took his usual post at the head of\\nthe adventurous little band. I followed without uttering a syllable.\\n\\nI felt like the lamb led to the slaughter.\\n\\nIn order to render the descent less difficult, Hans took his way down\\nthe interior of the cone in rather a zigzag fashion, making, as the\\nsailors say, long tracks to the eastward, followed by equally long ones\\nto the west. It was necessary to walk through the midst of eruptive\\nrocks, some of which, shaken in their balance, went rolling down with\\nthundering clamor to the bottom of the abyss. These continual falls\\nawoke echoes of singular power and effect.\\n\\nMany portions of the cone consisted of inferior glaciers. Hans, whenever\\nhe met with one of these obstacles, advanced with a great show of\\nprecaution, sounding the soil with his long iron pole in order to\\ndiscover fissures and layers of deep soft snow. In many doubtful or\\ndangerous places, it became necessary for us to be tied together by a\\nlong rope in order that should any one of us be unfortunate enough to\\nslip, he would be supported by his companions. This connecting link was\\ndoubtless a prudent precaution, but not by any means unattended with\\ndanger.\\n\\nNevertheless, and despite all the manifold difficulties of the descent,\\nalong slopes with which our guide was wholly unacquainted, we made\\nconsiderable progress without accident. One of our great parcels of rope\\nslipped from one of the Iceland porters, and rushed by a short cut to\\nthe bottom of the abyss.\\n\\nBy midday we were at the end of our journey. I looked upwards, and saw\\nonly the upper orifice of the cone, which served as a circular frame to\\na very small portion of the sky--a portion which seemed to me singularly\\nbeautiful. Should I ever again gaze on that lovely sunlit sky!\\n\\nThe only exception to this extraordinary landscape, was the Peak of\\nScartaris, which seemed lost in the great void of the heavens.\\n\\nThe bottom of the crater was composed of three separate shafts, through\\nwhich, during periods of eruption, when Sneffels was in action, the\\ngreat central furnace sent forth its burning lava and poisonous vapors.\\nEach of these chimneys or shafts gaped open-mouthed in our path. I kept\\nas far away from them as possible, not even venturing to take the\\nfaintest peep downwards.\\n\\nAs for the Professor, after a rapid examination of their disposition and\\ncharacteristics, he became breathless and panting. He ran from one to\\nthe other like a delighted schoolboy, gesticulating wildly, and uttering\\nincomprehensible and disjointed phrases in all sorts of languages.\\n\\nHans, the guide, and his humbler companions seated themselves on some\\npiles of lava and looked silently on. They clearly took my uncle for a\\nlunatic; and--waited the result.\\n\\nSuddenly the Professor uttered a wild, unearthly cry. At first I\\nimagined he had lost his footing, and was falling headlong into one of\\nthe yawning gulfs. Nothing of the kind. I saw him, his arms spread out\\nto their widest extent, his legs stretched apart, standing upright\\nbefore an enormous pedestal, high enough and black enough to bear a\\ngigantic statue of Pluto. His attitude and mien were that of a man\\nutterly stupefied. But his stupefaction was speedily changed to the\\nwildest joy.\\n\\n\"Harry! Harry! come here!\" he cried; \"make haste--wonderful--wonderful!\"\\n\\nUnable to understand what he meant, I turned to obey his commands.\\nNeither Hans nor the other Icelanders moved a step.\\n\\n\"Look!\" said the Professor, in something of the manner of the French\\ngeneral, pointing out the pyramids to his army.\\n\\nAnd fully partaking his stupefaction, if not his joy, I read on the\\neastern side of the huge block of stone, the same characters, half eaten\\naway by the corrosive action of time, the name, to me a thousand times\\naccursed--\\n\\n[Illustration: Runic Glyphs]\\n\\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" cried my uncle, \"now, unbeliever, do you begin to\\nhave faith?\"\\n\\nIt was totally impossible for me to answer a single word. I went back to\\nmy pile of lava, in a state of silent awe. The evidence was\\nunanswerable, overwhelming!\\n\\nIn a few moments, however, my thoughts were far away, back in my German\\nhome, with Gretchen and the old cook. What would I have given for one of\\nmy cousin\\'s smiles, for one of the ancient domestic\\'s omelettes, and for\\nmy own feather bed!\\n\\nHow long I remained in this state I know not. All I can say is, that\\nwhen at last I raised my head from between my hands, there remained at\\nthe bottom of the crater only myself, my uncle and Hans. The Icelandic\\nporters had been dismissed and were now descending the exterior slopes\\nof Mount Sneffels, on their way to Stapi. How heartily did I wish myself\\nwith them!\\n\\nHans slept tranquilly at the foot of a rock in a kind of rill of lava,\\nwhere he had made himself a rough and ready bed. MY uncle was walking\\nabout the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage. I had no\\ndesire, neither had I the strength, to move from my recumbent position.\\nTaking example by the guide, I gave way to a kind of painful somnolency,\\nduring which I seemed both to hear and feel continued heavings and\\nshudderings in the mountain.\\n\\nIn this way we passed our first night in the interior of a crater.\\n\\nNext morning, a grey, cloudy, heavy sky hung like a funereal pall over\\nthe summit of the volcanic cone. I did not notice it so much from the\\nobscurity that reigned around us, as from the rage with which my uncle\\nwas devoured.\\n\\nI fully understood the reason, and again a glimpse of hope made my heart\\nleap with joy. I will briefly explain the cause.\\n\\nOf the three openings which yawned beneath our steps, only one could\\nhave been followed by the adventurous Saknussemm. According to the words\\nof the learned Icelander, it was only to be known by that one particular\\nmentioned in the cryptograph, that the shadow of Scartaris fell upon it,\\njust touching its mouth in the last days of the month of June.\\n\\nWe were, in fact, to consider the pointed peak as the stylus of an\\nimmense sun-dial, the shadow of which pointed on one given day, like the\\ninexorable finger of fate, to the yawning chasm which led into the\\ninterior of the earth.\\n\\nNow, as often happens in these regions, should the sun fail to burst\\nthrough the clouds, no shadow. Consequently, no chance of discovering\\nthe right aperture. We had already reached the 25th June. If the kindly\\nheavens would only remain densely clouded for six more days, we should\\nhave to put off our voyage of discovery for another year, when certainly\\nthere would be one person fewer in the party. I already had sufficient\\nof the mad and monstrous enterprise.\\n\\nIt would be utterly impossible to depict the impotent rage of Professor\\nHardwigg. The day passed away, and not the faintest outline of a shadow\\ncould be seen at the bottom of the crater. Hans the guide never moved\\nfrom his place. He must have been curious to know what we were about, if\\nindeed he could believe we were about anything. As for my uncle, he\\nnever addressed a word to me. He was nursing his wrath to keep it warm!\\nHis eyes fixed on the black and foggy atmosphere, his complexion hideous\\nwith suppressed passion. Never had his eyes appeared so fierce, his nose\\nso aquiline, his mouth so hard and firm.\\n\\nOn the 26th no change for the better. A mixture of rain and snow fell\\nduring the whole day. Hans very quietly built himself a hut of lava into\\nwhich he retired like Diogenes into his tub. I took a malicious delight\\nin watching the thousand little cascades that flowed down the side of\\nthe cone, carrying with them at times a stream of stones into the \"vasty\\ndeep\" below.\\n\\nMy uncle was almost frantic: to be sure, it was enough to make even a\\npatient man angry. He had reached to a certain extent the goal of his\\ndesires, and yet he was likely to be wrecked in port.\\n\\nBut if the heavens and the elements are capable of causing us much pain\\nand sorrow, there are two sides to a medal. And there was reserved for\\nProfessor Hardwigg a brilliant and sudden surprise which was to\\ncompensate him for all his sufferings.\\n\\nNext day the sky was still overcast, but on Sunday, the 28th, the last\\nday but two of the month, with a sudden change of wind and a new moon\\nthere came a change of weather. The sun poured its beaming rays to the\\nvery bottom of the crater.\\n\\nEach hillock, every rock, every stone, every asperity of the soil had\\nits share of the luminous effulgence, and its shadow fell heavily on the\\nsoil. Among others, to his insane delight, the shadow of Scartaris was\\nmarked and clear, and moved slowly with the radiant start of day.\\n\\nMy uncle moved with it in a state of mental ecstasy.\\n\\nAt twelve o\\'clock exactly, when the sun had attained its highest\\naltitude for the day, the shadow fell upon the edge of the central pit!\\n\\n\"Here it is,\" gasped the Professor in an agony of joy, \"here it is--we\\nhave found it. Forward, my friends, into the Interior of the Earth.\"\\n\\nI looked curiously at Hans to see what reply he would make to this\\nterrific announcement.\\n\\n\"Forut,\" said the guide tranquilly.\\n\\n\"Forward it is,\" answered my uncle, who was now in the seventh heaven of\\ndelight.\\n\\nWhen we were quite ready, our watches indicated thirteen minutes past\\none!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nTHE REAL JOURNEY COMMENCES\\n\\n\\nOur real journey had now commenced. Hitherto our courage and\\ndetermination had overcome all difficulties. We were fatigued at times;\\nand that was all. Now we were about to encounter unknown and fearful\\ndangers.\\n\\nI had not as yet ventured to take a glimpse down the horrible abyss into\\nwhich in a few minutes more I was about to plunge. The fatal moment had,\\nhowever, at last arrived. I had still the option of refusing or\\naccepting a share in this foolish and audacious enterprise. But I was\\nashamed to show more fear than the eider-duck hunter. Hans seemed to\\naccept the difficulties of the journey so tranquilly, with such calm\\nindifference, with such perfect recklessness of all danger, that I\\nactually blushed to appear less of a man than he!\\n\\nHad I been alone with my uncle, I should certainly have sat down and\\nargued the point fully; but in the presence of the guide I held my\\ntongue. I gave one moment to the thought of my charming cousin, and then\\nI advanced to the mouth of the central shaft.\\n\\nIt measured about a hundred feet in diameter, which made about three\\nhundred in circumference. I leaned over a rock which stood on its edge,\\nand looked down. My hair stood on end, my teeth chattered, my limbs\\ntrembled. I seemed utterly to lose my centre of gravity, while my head\\nwas in a sort of whirl, like that of a drunken man. There is nothing\\nmore powerful than this attraction towards an abyss. I was about to fall\\nheadlong into the gaping well, when I was drawn back by a firm and\\npowerful hand. It was that of Hans. I had not taken lessons enough at\\nthe Frelser\\'s-Kirk of Copenhagen in the art of looking down from lofty\\neminences without blinking!\\n\\nHowever, few as the minutes were during which I gazed down this\\ntremendous and even wondrous shaft, I had a sufficient glimpse of it to\\ngive me some idea of its physical conformation. Its sides, which were\\nalmost as perpendicular as those of a well, presented numerous\\nprojections which doubtless would assist our descent.\\n\\nIt was a sort of wild and savage staircase, without bannister or fence.\\nA rope fastened above, near the surface, would certainly support our\\nweight and enable us to reach the bottom, but how, when we had arrived\\nat its utmost depth, were we to loosen it above? This was, I thought, a\\nquestion of some importance.\\n\\nMy uncle, however, was one of those men who are nearly always prepared\\nwith expedients. He hit upon a very simple method of obviating this\\ndifficulty. He unrolled a cord about as thick as my thumb, and at least\\nfour hundred feet in length. He allowed about half of it to go down the\\npit and catch in a hitch over a great block of lava which stood on the\\nedge of the precipice. This done, he threw the second half after the\\nfirst.\\n\\nEach of us could now descend by catching the two cords in one hand. When\\nabout two hundred feet below, all the explorer had to do was to let go\\none end and pull away at the other, when the cord would come falling at\\nhis feet. In order to go down farther, all that was necessary was to\\ncontinue the same operation.\\n\\nThis was a very excellent proposition, and no doubt, a correct one.\\nGoing down appeared to me easy enough; it was the coming up again that\\nnow occupied my thoughts.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, as soon as he had completed this important\\npreparation, \"let us see about the baggage. It must be divided into\\nthree separate parcels, and each of us must carry one on his back. I\\nallude to the more important and fragile articles.\"\\n\\nMy worthy and ingenious uncle did not appear to consider that we came\\nunder the denomination.\\n\\n\"Hans,\" he continued, \"you will take charge of the tools and some of the\\nprovisions; you, Harry, must take possession of another third of the\\nprovisions and of the arms. I will load myself with the rest of the\\neatables, and with the more delicate instruments.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" I exclaimed, \"our clothes, this mass of cord and ladders--who\\nwill undertake to carry them down?\"\\n\\n\"They will go down of themselves.\"\\n\\n\"And how so?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"You shall see.\"\\n\\nMy uncle was not fond of half measures, nor did he like anything in the\\nway of hesitation. Giving his orders to Hans he had the whole of the\\nnonfragile articles made up into one bundle; and the packet, firmly and\\nsolidly fastened, was simply pitched over the edge of the gulf.\\n\\nI heard the moaning of the suddenly displaced air, and the noise of\\nfalling stones. My uncle leaning over the abyss followed the descent of\\nhis luggage with a perfectly self-satisfied air, and did not rise until\\nit had completely disappeared from sight.\\n\\n\"Now then,\" he cried, \"it is our turn.\"\\n\\nI put it in good faith to any man of common sense--was it possible to\\nhear this energetic cry without a shudder?\\n\\nThe Professor fastened his case of instruments on his back. Hans took\\ncharge of the tools, I of the arms. The descent then commenced in the\\nfollowing order: Hans went first, my uncle followed, and I went last.\\nOur progress was made in profound silence--a silence only troubled by\\nthe fall of pieces of rock, which breaking from the jagged sides, fell\\nwith a roar into the depths below.\\n\\nI allowed myself to slide, so to speak, holding frantically on the\\ndouble cord with one hand and with the other keeping myself off the\\nrocks by the assistance of my iron-shod pole. One idea was all the time\\nimpressed upon my brain. I feared that the upper support would fail me.\\nThe cord appeared to me far too fragile to bear the weight of three such\\npersons as we were, with our luggage. I made as little use of it as\\npossible, trusting to my own agility and doing miracles in the way of\\nfeats of dexterity and strength upon the projecting shelves and spurs of\\nlava which my feet seemed to clutch as strongly as my hands.\\n\\nThe guide went first, I have said, and when one of the slippery and\\nfrail supports broke from under his feet he had recourse to his usual\\nmonosyllabic way of speaking.\\n\\n\"Gif akt--\"\\n\\n\"Attention--look out,\" repeated my uncle.\\n\\nIn about half an hour we reached a kind of small terrace formed by a\\nfragment of rock projecting some distance from the sides of the shaft.\\n\\nHans now began to haul upon the cord on one side only, the other going\\nas quietly upward as the other came down. It fell at last, bringing with\\nit a shower of small stones, lava and dust, a disagreeable kind of rain\\nor hail.\\n\\nWhile we were seated on this extraordinary bench I ventured once more to\\nlook downwards. With a sigh I discovered that the bottom was still\\nwholly invisible. Were we, then, going direct to the interior of the\\nearth?\\n\\nThe performance with the cord recommenced, and a quarter of an hour\\nlater we had reached to the depth of another two hundred feet.\\n\\nI have very strong doubts if the most determined geologist would, during\\nthat descent, have studied the nature of the different layers of earth\\naround him. I did not trouble my head much about the matter; whether we\\nwere among the combustible carbon, Silurians, or primitive soil, I\\nneither knew nor cared to know.\\n\\nNot so the inveterate Professor. He must have taken notes all the way\\ndown, for, at one of our halts, he began a brief lecture.\\n\\n\"The farther we advance,\" said he, \"the greater is my confidence in the\\nresult. The disposition of these volcanic strata absolutely confirms the\\ntheories of Sir Humphry Davy. We are still within the region of the\\nprimordial soil, the soil in which took place the chemical operation of\\nmetals becoming inflamed by coming in contact with the air and water. I\\nat once regret the old and now forever exploded theory of a central\\nfire. At all events, we shall soon know the truth.\"\\n\\nSuch was the everlasting conclusion to which he came. I, however, was\\nvery far from being in humor to discuss the matter. I had something else\\nto think of. My silence was taken for consent; and still we continued to\\ngo down.\\n\\nAt the expiration of three hours, we were, to all appearance, as far off\\nas ever from the bottom of the well. When I looked upwards, however, I\\ncould see that the upper orifice was every minute decreasing in size.\\nThe sides of the shaft were getting closer and closer together, we were\\napproaching the regions of eternal night!\\n\\nAnd still we continued to descend!\\n\\nAt length, I noticed that when pieces of stone were detached from the\\nsides of this stupendous precipice, they were swallowed up with less\\nnoise than before. The final sound was sooner heard. We were approaching\\nthe bottom of the abyss!\\n\\nAs I had been very careful to keep account of all the changes of cord\\nwhich took place, I was able to tell exactly what was the depth we had\\nreached, as well as the time it had taken.\\n\\nWe had shifted the rope twenty-eight times, each operation taking a\\nquarter of an hour, which in all made seven hours. To this had to be\\nadded twenty-eight pauses; in all ten hours and a half. We started at\\none, it was now, therefore, about eleven o\\'clock at night.\\n\\nIt does not require great knowledge of arithmetic to know that\\ntwenty-eight times two hundred feet makes five thousand six hundred feet\\nin all (more than an English mile).\\n\\nWhile I was making this mental calculation a voice broke the silence. It\\nwas the voice of Hans.\\n\\n\"Halt!\" he cried.\\n\\nI checked myself very suddenly, just at the moment when I was about to\\nkick my uncle on the head.\\n\\n\"We have reached the end of our journey,\" said the worthy Professor in a\\nsatisfied tone.\\n\\n\"What, the interior of the earth?\" said I, slipping down to his side.\\n\\n\"No, you stupid fellow! but we have reached the bottom of the well.\"\\n\\n\"And I suppose there is no farther progress to be made?\" I hopefully\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I can dimly see a sort of tunnel, which turns off obliquely to\\nthe right. At all events, we must see about that tomorrow. Let us sup\\nnow, and seek slumber as best we may.\"\\n\\nI thought it time, but made no observations on that point. I was fairly\\nlaunched on a desperate course, and all I had to do was to go forward\\nhopefully and trustingly.\\n\\nIt was not even now quite dark, the light filtering down in a most\\nextraordinary manner.\\n\\nWe opened the provision bag, ate a frugal supper, and each did his best\\nto find a bed amid the pile of stones, dirt, and lava which had\\naccumulated for ages at the bottom of the shaft.\\n\\nI happened to grope out the pile of ropes, ladders, and clothes which we\\nhad thrown down; and upon them I stretched myself. After such a day\\'s\\nlabor, my rough bed seemed as soft as down!\\n\\nFor a while I lay in a sort of pleasant trance.\\n\\nPresently, after lying quietly for some minutes, I opened my eyes and\\nlooked upwards. As I did so I made out a brilliant little dot, at the\\nextremity of this long, gigantic telescope.\\n\\nIt was a star without scintillating rays. According to my calculation,\\nit must be Beta in the constellation of the Little Bear.\\n\\nAfter this little bit of astronomical recreation, I dropped into a sound\\nsleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\nWE CONTINUE OUR DESCENT\\n\\n\\nAt eight o\\'clock the next morning, a faint kind of dawn of day awoke us.\\nThe thousand and one prisms of the lava collected the light as it passed\\nand brought it to us like a shower of sparks.\\n\\nWe were able with ease to see objects around us.\\n\\n\"Well, Harry, my boy,\" cried the delighted Professor, rubbing his hands\\ntogether, \"what say you now? Did you ever pass a more tranquil night in\\nour house in the Konigstrasse? No deafening sounds of cart wheels, no\\ncries of hawkers, no bad language from boatmen or watermen!\"\\n\\n\"Well, Uncle, we are quite at the bottom of this well--but to me there\\nis something terrible in this calm.\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" said the Professor hotly, \"one would say you were already\\nbeginning to be afraid. How will you get on presently? Do you know, that\\nas yet, we have not penetrated one inch into the bowels of the earth.\"\\n\\n\"What can you mean, sir?\" was my bewildered and astonished reply.\\n\\n\"I mean to say that we have only just reached the soil of the island\\nitself. This long vertical tube, which ends at the bottom of the crater\\nof Sneffels, ceases here just about on a level with the sea.\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Quite sure. Consult the barometer.\"\\n\\nIt was quite true that the mercury, after rising gradually in the\\ninstrument, as long as our descent was taking place, had stopped\\nprecisely at twenty-nine degrees.\\n\\n\"You perceive,\" said the Professor, \"we have as yet only to endure the\\npressure of air. I am curious to replace the barometer by the\\nmanometer.\"\\n\\nThe barometer, in fact, was about to become useless--as soon as the\\nweight of the air was greater than what was calculated as above the\\nlevel of the ocean.\\n\\n\"But,\" said I, \"is it not very much to be feared that this\\never-increasing pressure may not in the end turn out very painful and\\ninconvenient?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said he. \"We shall descend very slowly, and our lungs will be\\ngradually accustomed to breathe compressed air. It is well known that\\naeronauts have gone so high as to be nearly without air at all--why,\\nthen, should we not accustom ourselves to breathe when we have, say, a\\nlittle too much of it? For myself, I am certain I shall prefer it. Let\\nus not lose a moment. Where is the packet which preceded us in our\\ndescent?\"\\n\\nI smilingly pointed it out to my uncle. Hans had not seen it, and\\nbelieved it caught somewhere above us: \"Huppe\" as he phrased it.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, \"let us breakfast, and break fast like people who\\nhave a long day\\'s work before them.\"\\n\\nBiscuit and dried meat, washed down by some mouthfuls of water flavored\\nwith Schiedam, was the material of our luxurious meal.\\n\\nAs soon as it was finished, my uncle took from his pocket a notebook\\ndestined to be filled by memoranda of our travels. He had already placed\\nhis instruments in order, and this is what he wrote:\\n\\n\\n     Monday, June 29th\\n\\n     Chronometer, 8h. 17m. morning.\\n\\n     Barometer, 29.6 inches.\\n\\n     Thermometer, 6 degrees [43 degrees Fahr.]\\n\\n     Direction, E.S.E.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis last observation referred to the obscure gallery, and was indicated\\nto us by the compass.\\n\\n\"Now, Harry,\" cried the Professor, in an enthusiastic tone of voice, \"we\\nare truly about to take our first step into the Interior of the Earth;\\nnever before visited by man since the first creation of the world. You\\nmay consider, therefore, that at this precise moment our travels really\\ncommence.\"\\n\\nAs my uncle made this remark, he took in one hand the Ruhmkorff coil\\napparatus, which hung round his neck, and with the other he put the\\nelectric current into communication with the worm of the lantern. And a\\nbright light at once illumined that dark and gloomy tunnel!\\n\\nThe effect was magical!\\n\\nHans, who carried the second apparatus, had it also put into operation.\\nThis ingenious application of electricity to practical purposes enabled\\nus to move along by the light of an artificial day, amid even the flow\\nof the most inflammable and combustible gases.\\n\\n\"Forward!\" cried my uncle. Each took up his burden. Hans went first, my\\nuncle followed, and I going third, we entered the somber gallery!\\n\\nJust as we were about to engulf ourselves in this dismal passage, I\\nlifted up my head, and through the tubelike shaft saw that Iceland sky I\\nwas never to see again!\\n\\nWas it the last I should ever see of any sky?\\n\\nThe stream of lava flowing from the bowels of the earth in 1219 had\\nforced itself a passage through the tunnel. It lined the whole of the\\ninside with its thick and brilliant coating. The electric light added\\nvery greatly to the brilliancy of the effect.\\n\\nThe great difficulty of our journey now began. How were we to prevent\\nourselves from slipping down the steeply inclined plane? Happily some\\ncracks, abrasures of the soil, and other irregularities, served the\\nplace of steps; and we descended slowly; allowing our heavy luggage to\\nslip on before, at the end of a long cord.\\n\\nBut that which served as steps under our feet became in other places\\nstalactites. The lava, very porous in certain places, took the form of\\nlittle round blisters. Crystals of opaque quartz, adorned with limpid\\ndrops of natural glass suspended to the roof like lusters, seemed to\\ntake fire as we passed beneath them. One would have fancied that the\\ngenii of romance were illuminating their underground palaces to receive\\nthe sons of men.\\n\\n\"Magnificent, glorious!\" I cried in a moment of involuntary enthusiasm,\\n\"What a spectacle, Uncle! Do you not admire these variegated shades of\\nlava, which run through a whole series of colors, from reddish brown to\\npale yellow--by the most insensible degrees? And these crystals, they\\nappear like luminous globes.\"\\n\\n\"You are beginning to see the charms of travel, Master Harry,\" cried my\\nuncle. \"Wait a bit, until we advance farther. What we have as yet\\ndiscovered is nothing--onwards, my boy, onwards!\"\\n\\nIt would have been a far more correct and appropriate expression, had he\\nsaid, \"let us slide,\" for we were going down an inclined plane with\\nperfect ease. The compass indicated that we were moving in a\\nsoutheasterly direction. The flow of lava had never turned to the right\\nor the left. It had the inflexibility of a straight line.\\n\\nNevertheless, to my surprise, we found no perceptible increase in heat.\\nThis proved the theories of Humphry Davy to be founded on truth, and\\nmore than once I found myself examining the thermometer in silent\\nastonishment.\\n\\nTwo hours after our departure it only marked fifty-four degrees\\nFahrenheit. I had every reason to believe from this that our descent was\\nfar more horizontal than vertical. As for discovering the exact depth to\\nwhich we had attained, nothing could be easier. The Professor as he\\nadvanced measured the angles of deviation and inclination; but he kept\\nthe result of his observations to himself.\\n\\nAbout eight o\\'clock in the evening, my uncle gave the signal for\\nhalting. Hans seated himself on the ground. The lamps were hung to\\nfissures in the lava rock. We were now in a large cavern where air was\\nnot wanting. On the contrary, it abounded. What could be the cause of\\nthis--to what atmospheric agitation could be ascribed this draught? But\\nthis was a question which I did not care to discuss just then. Fatigue\\nand hunger made me incapable of reasoning. An unceasing march of seven\\nhours had not been kept up without great exhaustion. I was really and\\ntruly worn out; and delighted enough I was to hear the word Halt.\\n\\nHans laid out some provisions on a lump of lava, and we each supped with\\nkeen relish. One thing, however, caused us great uneasiness--our water\\nreserve was already half exhausted. My uncle had full confidence in\\nfinding subterranean resources, but hitherto we had completely failed in\\nso doing. I could not help calling my uncle\\'s attention to the\\ncircumstance.\\n\\n\"And you are surprised at this total absence of springs?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Doubtless--I am very uneasy on the point. We have certainly not enough\\nwater to last us five days.\"\\n\\n\"Be quite easy on that matter,\" continued my uncle. \"I answer for it we\\nshall find plenty of water--in fact, far more than we shall want.\"\\n\\n\"But when?\"\\n\\n\"When we once get through this crust of lava. How can you expect springs\\nto force their way through these solid stone walls?\"\\n\\n\"But what is there to prove that this concrete mass of lava does not\\nextend to the centre of the earth? I don\\'t think we have as yet done\\nmuch in a vertical way.\"\\n\\n\"What puts that into your head, my boy?\" asked my uncle mildly.\\n\\n\"Well, it appears to me that if we had descended very far below the\\nlevel of the sea--we should find it rather hotter than we have.\"\\n\\n\"According to your system,\" said my uncle; \"but what does the\\nthermometer say?\"\\n\\n\"Scarcely fifteen degrees by Reaumur, which is only an increase of nine\\nsince our departure.\"\\n\\n\"Well, and what conclusion does that bring you to?\" inquired the\\nProfessor.\\n\\n\"The deduction I draw from this is very simple. According to the most\\nexact observations, the augmentation of the temperature of the interior\\nof the earth is one degree for every hundred feet. But certain local\\ncauses may considerably modify this figure. Thus at Yakoust in Siberia,\\nit has been remarked that the heat increases a degree every thirty-six\\nfeet. The difference evidently depends on the conductibility of certain\\nrocks. In the neighborhood of an extinct volcano, it has been remarked\\nthat the elevation of temperature was only one degree in every\\nfive-and-twenty feet. Let us, then, go upon this calculation--which is\\nthe most favorable--and calculate.\"\\n\\n\"Calculate away, my boy.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing easier,\" said I, pulling out my notebook and pencil. \"Nine\\ntimes one hundred and twenty-five feet make a depth of eleven hundred\\nand twenty-five feet.\"\\n\\n\"Archimedes could not have spoken more geometrically.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\n\"Well, according to my observations, we are at least ten thousand feet\\nbelow the level of the sea.\"\\n\\n\"Can it be possible?\"\\n\\n\"Either my calculation is correct, or there is no truth in figures.\"\\n\\nThe calculations of the Professor were perfectly correct. We were\\nalready six thousand feet deeper down in the bowels of the earth than\\nanyone had ever been before. The lowest known depth to which man had\\nhitherto penetrated was in the mines of Kitzbuhel, in the Tirol, and\\nthose of Wurttemberg.\\n\\nThe temperature, which should have been eighty-one, was in this place\\nonly fifteen. This was a matter for serious consideration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\nTHE EASTERN TUNNEL\\n\\n\\nThe next day was Tuesday, the 30th of June--and at six o\\'clock in the\\nmorning we resumed our journey.\\n\\nWe still continued to follow the gallery of lava, a perfect natural\\npathway, as easy of descent as some of those inclined planes which, in\\nvery old German houses, serve the purpose of staircases. This went on\\nuntil seventeen minutes past twelve, the precise instant at which we\\nrejoined Hans, who, having been somewhat in advance, had suddenly\\nstopped.\\n\\n\"At last,\" cried my uncle, \"we have reached the end of the shaft.\"\\n\\nI looked wonderingly about me. We were in the centre of four cross\\npaths--somber and narrow tunnels. The question now arose as to which it\\nwas wise to take; and this of itself was no small difficulty.\\n\\nMy uncle, who did not wish to appear to have any hesitation about the\\nmatter before myself or the guide, at once made up his mind. He pointed\\nquietly to the eastern tunnel; and, without delay, we entered within its\\ngloomy recesses.\\n\\nBesides, had he entertained any feeling of hesitation it might have been\\nprolonged indefinitely, for there was no indication by which to\\ndetermine on a choice. It was absolutely necessary to trust to chance\\nand good fortune!\\n\\nThe descent of this obscure and narrow gallery was very gradual and\\nwinding. Sometimes we gazed through a succession of arches, its course\\nvery like the aisles of a Gothic cathedral. The great artistic sculptors\\nand builders of the Middle Ages might have here completed their studies\\nwith advantage. Many most beautiful and suggestive ideas of\\narchitectural beauty would have been discovered by them. After passing\\nthrough this phase of the cavernous way, we suddenly came, about a mile\\nfarther on, upon a square system of arch, adopted by the early Romans,\\nprojecting from the solid rock, and keeping up the weight of the roof.\\n\\nSuddenly we would come upon a series of low subterranean tunnels which\\nlooked like beaver holes, or the work of foxes--through whose narrow and\\nwinding ways we had literally to crawl!\\n\\nThe heat still remained at quite a supportable degree. With an\\ninvoluntary shudder, I reflected on what the heat must have been when\\nthe volcano of Sneffels was pouring its smoke, flames, and streams of\\nboiling lava--all of which must have come up by the road we were now\\nfollowing. I could imagine the torrents of hot seething stone darting\\non, bubbling up with accompaniments of smoke, steam, and sulphurous\\nstench!\\n\\n\"Only to think of the consequences,\" I mused, \"if the old volcano were\\nonce more to set to work.\"\\n\\nI did not communicate these rather unpleasant reflections to my uncle.\\nHe not only would not have understood them, but would have been\\nintensely disgusted. His only idea was to go ahead. He walked, he slid,\\nhe clambered over piles of fragments, he rolled down heaps of broken\\nlava, with an earnestness and conviction it was impossible not to\\nadmire.\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock in the evening, after a very wearisome journey, but one\\nnot so fatiguing as before, we had made six miles towards the southward,\\nbut had not gone more than a mile downwards.\\n\\nMy uncle, as usual, gave the signal to halt. We ate our meal in\\nthoughtful silence, and then retired to sleep.\\n\\nOur arrangements for the night were very primitive and simple. A\\ntraveling rug, in which each rolled himself, was all our bedding. We had\\nno necessity to fear cold or any unpleasant visit. Travelers who bury\\nthemselves in the wilds and depths of the African desert, who seek\\nprofit and pleasure in the forests of the New World, are compelled to\\ntake it in turn to watch during the hours of sleep; but in this region\\nof the earth absolute solitude and complete security reigned supreme.\\n\\nWe had nothing to fear either from savages or from wild beasts.\\n\\nAfter a night\\'s sweet repose, we awoke fresh and ready for action. There\\nbeing nothing to detain us, we started on our journey. We continued to\\nburrow through the lava tunnel as before. It was impossible to make out\\nthrough what soil we were making way. The tunnel, moreover, instead of\\ngoing down into the bowels of the earth, became absolutely horizontal.\\n\\nI even thought, after some examination, that we were actually tending\\nupwards. About ten o\\'clock in the day this state of things became so\\nclear that, finding the change very fatiguing, I was obliged to slacken\\nmy pace and finally come to a halt.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the Professor quickly, \"what is the matter?\"\\n\\n\"The fact is, I am dreadfully tired,\" was my earnest reply.\\n\\n\"What,\" cried my uncle, \"tired after a three hours\\' walk, and by so easy\\na road?\"\\n\\n\"Easy enough, I dare say, but very fatiguing.\"\\n\\n\"But how can that be, when all we have to do is to go downwards.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. For some time I have noticed that we are going\\nupwards.\"\\n\\n\"Upwards,\" cried my uncle, shrugging his shoulders, \"how can that be?\"\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt about it. For the last half hour the slopes have\\nbeen upward--and if we go on in this way much longer we shall find\\nourselves back in Iceland.\"\\n\\nMy uncle shook his head with the air of a man who does not want to be\\nconvinced. I tried to continue the conversation. He would not answer me,\\nbut once more gave the signal for departure. His silence I thought was\\nonly caused by concentrated ill-temper.\\n\\nHowever this might be, I once more took up my load, and boldly and\\nresolutely followed Hans, who was now in advance of my uncle. I did not\\nlike to be beaten or even distanced. I was naturally anxious not to lose\\nsight of my companions. The very idea of being left behind, lost in that\\nterrible labyrinth, made me shiver as with the ague.\\n\\nBesides, if the ascending path was more arduous and painful to clamber,\\nI had one source of secret consolation and delight. It was to all\\nappearance taking us back to the surface of the earth. That of itself\\nwas hopeful. Every step I took confirmed me in my belief, and I began\\nalready to build castles in the air in relation to my marriage with my\\npretty little cousin.\\n\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock there was a great and sudden change in the aspect\\nof the rocky sides of the gallery. I first noticed it from the\\ndiminution of the rays of light which cast back the reflection of the\\nlamp. From being coated with shining and resplendent lava, it became\\nliving rock. The sides were sloping walls, which sometimes became quite\\nvertical.\\n\\nWe were now in what the geological professors call a state of\\ntransition, in the period of Silurian stones, so called because this\\nspecimen of early formation is very common in England in the counties\\nformerly inhabited by the Celtic nation known as Silures.\\n\\n\"I can see clearly now,\" I cried; \"the sediment from the waters which\\nonce covered the whole earth formed during the second period of its\\nexistence these schists and these calcareous rocks. We are turning our\\nbacks on the granite rocks, and are like people from Hamburg who would\\ngo to Lubeck by way of Hanover.\"\\n\\nI might just as well have kept my observations to myself. My geological\\nenthusiasm got the better, however, of my cooler judgment, and Professor\\nHardwigg heard my observations.\\n\\n\"What is the matter now?\" he said, in a tone of great gravity.\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried I, \"do you not see these different layers of calcareous\\nrocks and the first indication of slate strata?\"\\n\\n\"Well; what then?\"\\n\\n\"We have arrived at that period of the world\\'s existence when the first\\nplants and the first animals made their appearance.\"\\n\\n\"You think so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, look; examine and judge for yourself.\"\\n\\nI induced the Professor with some difficulty to cast the light of his\\nlamp on the sides of the long winding gallery. I expected some\\nexclamation to burst from his lips. I was very much mistaken. The worthy\\nProfessor never spoke a word.\\n\\nIt was impossible to say whether he understood me or not. Perhaps it was\\npossible that in his pride--my uncle and a learned professor--he did not\\nlike to own that he was wrong in having chosen the eastern tunnel, or\\nwas he determined at any price to go to the end of it? It was quite\\nevident we had left the region of lava, and that the road by which we\\nwere going could not take us back to the great crater of Mount Sneffels.\\n\\nAs we went along I could not help ruminating on the whole question, and\\nasked myself if I did not lay too great a stress on these sudden and\\npeculiar modifications of the earth\\'s crust.\\n\\nAfter all, I was very likely to be mistaken--and it was within the range\\nof probability and possibility that we were not making our way through\\nthe strata of rocks which I believed I recognized piled on the lower\\nlayer of granitic formation.\\n\\n\"At all events, if I am right,\" I thought to myself, \"I must certainly\\nfind some remains of primitive plants, and it will be absolutely\\nnecessary to give way to such indubitable evidence. Let us have a good\\nsearch.\"\\n\\nI accordingly lost no opportunity of searching, and had not gone more\\nthan about a hundred yards, when the evidence I sought for cropped up in\\nthe most incontestable manner before my eyes. It was quite natural that\\nI should expect to find these signs, for during the Silurian period the\\nseas contained no fewer than fifteen hundred different animal and\\nvegetable species. My feet, so long accustomed to the hard and arid lava\\nsoil, suddenly found themselves treading on a kind of soft dust, the\\nremains of plants and shells.\\n\\nUpon the walls themselves I could clearly make out the outline, as plain\\nas a sun picture, of the fucus and the lycopods. The worthy and\\nexcellent Professor Hardwigg could not of course make any mistake about\\nthe matter; but I believe he deliberately closed his eyes, and continued\\non his way with a firm and unalterable step.\\n\\nI began to think that he was carrying his obstinacy a great deal too\\nfar. I could no longer act with prudence or composure. I stooped on a\\nsudden and picked up an almost perfect shell, which had undoubtedly\\nbelonged to some animal very much resembling some of the present day.\\nHaving secured the prize, I followed in the wake of my uncle.\\n\\n\"Do you see this?\" I said.\\n\\n\"Well, said the Professor, with the most imperturbable tranquillity, \"it\\nis the shell of a crustaceous animal of the extinct order of the\\ntrilobites; nothing more, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" cried I, much troubled at his coolness, \"do you draw no\\nconclusion from it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, if I may ask, what conclusion do you draw from it yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I thought--\"\\n\\n\"I know, my boy, what you would say, and you are right, perfectly and\\nincontestably right. We have finally abandoned the crust of lava and the\\nroad by which the lava ascended. It is quite possible that I may have\\nbeen mistaken, but I shall be unable to discover my error until I get to\\nthe end of this gallery.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right as far as that is concerned,\" I replied, \"and I\\nshould highly approve of your decision, if we had not to fear the\\ngreatest of all dangers.\"\\n\\n\"And what is that?\"\\n\\n\"Want of water.\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear Henry, it can\\'t be helped. We must put ourselves on\\nrations.\"\\n\\nAnd on he went.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\nDEEPER AND DEEPER--THE COAL MINE\\n\\n\\nIn truth, we were compelled to put ourselves upon rations. Our supply\\nwould certainly last not more than three days. I found this out about\\nsupper time. The worst part of the matter was that, in what is called\\nthe transition rocks, it was hardly to be expected we should meet with\\nwater!\\n\\nI had read of the horrors of thirst, and I knew that where we were, a\\nbrief trial of its sufferings would put an end to our adventures--and\\nour lives! But it was utterly useless to discuss the matter with my\\nuncle. He would have answered by some axiom from Plato.\\n\\nDuring the whole of next day we proceeded on our journey through this\\ninterminable gallery, arch after arch, tunnel after tunnel. We journeyed\\nwithout exchanging a word. We had become as mute and reticent as Hans,\\nour guide.\\n\\nThe road had no longer an upward tendency; at all events, if it had, it\\nwas not to be made out very clearly. Sometimes there could be no doubt\\nthat we were going downwards. But this inclination was scarcely to be\\ndistinguished, and was by no means reassuring to the Professor, because\\nthe character of the strata was in no wise modified, and the transition\\ncharacter of the rocks became more and more marked.\\n\\nIt was a glorious sight to see how the electric light brought out the\\nsparkles in the walls of the calcareous rocks, and the old red\\nsandstone. One might have fancied oneself in one of those deep cuttings\\nin Devonshire, which have given their name to this kind of soil. Some\\nmagnificent specimens of marble projected from the sides of the gallery:\\nsome of an agate grey with white veins of variegated character, others\\nof a yellow spotted color, with red veins; farther off might be seen\\nsamples of color in which cherry-tinted seams were to be found in all\\ntheir brightest shades.\\n\\nThe greater number of these marbles were stamped with the marks of\\nprimitive animals. Since the previous evening, nature and creation had\\nmade considerable progress. Instead of the rudimentary trilobites, I\\nperceived the remains of a more perfect order. Among others, the fish in\\nwhich the eye of a geologist has been able to discover the first form of\\nthe reptile.\\n\\nThe Devonian seas were inhabited by a vast number of animals of this\\nspecies, which were deposited in tens of thousands in the rocks of new\\nformation.\\n\\nIt was quite evident to me that we were ascending the scale of animal\\nlife of which man forms the summit. My excellent uncle, the Professor,\\nappeared not to take notice of these warnings. He was determined at any\\nrisk to proceed.\\n\\nHe must have been in expectation of one of two things; either that a\\nvertical well was about to open under his feet, and thus allow him to\\ncontinue his descent, or that some insurmountable obstacle would compel\\nus to stop and go back by the road we had so long traveled. But evening\\ncame again, and, to my horror, neither hope was doomed to be realized!\\n\\nOn Friday, after a night when I began to feel the gnawing agony of\\nthirst, and when in consequence appetite decreased, our little band rose\\nand once more followed the turnings and windings, the ascents and\\ndescents, of this interminable gallery. All were silent and gloomy. I\\ncould see that even my uncle had ventured too far.\\n\\nAfter about ten hours of further progress--a progress dull and\\nmonotonous to the last degree--I remarked that the reverberation, and\\nreflection of our lamps upon the sides of the tunnel, had singularly\\ndiminished. The marble, the schist, the calcareous rocks, the red\\nsandstone, had disappeared, leaving in their places a dark and gloomy\\nwall, somber and without brightness. When we reached a remarkably narrow\\npart of the tunnel, I leaned my left hand against the rock.\\n\\nWhen I took my hand away, and happened to glance at it, it was quite\\nblack. We had reached the coal strata of the Central Earth.\\n\\n\"A coal mine!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"A coal mine without miners,\" responded my uncle, a little severely.\\n\\n\"How can we tell?\"\\n\\n\"I can tell,\" replied my uncle, in a sharp and doctorial tone. \"I am\\nperfectly certain that this gallery through successive layers of coal\\nwas not cut by the hand of man. But whether it is the work of nature or\\nnot is of little concern to us. The hour for our evening meal has\\ncome--let us sup.\"\\n\\nHans, the guide, occupied himself in preparing food. I had come to that\\npoint when I could no longer eat. All I cared about were the few drops\\nof water which fell to my share. What I suffered it is useless to\\nrecord. The guide\\'s gourd, not quite half full, was all that was left\\nfor us three!\\n\\nHaving finished their repast, my two companions laid themselves down\\nupon their rugs, and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and\\nsufferings. As for me, I could not sleep, I lay counting the hours until\\nmorning.\\n\\nThe next morning, Saturday, at six o\\'clock, we started again. Twenty\\nminutes later we suddenly came upon a vast excavation. From its mighty\\nextent I saw at once that the hand of man could have had nothing to do\\nwith this coal mine; the vault above would have fallen in; as it was, it\\nwas only held together by some miracle of nature.\\n\\nThis mighty natural cavern was about a hundred feet wide, by about a\\nhundred and fifty high. The earth had evidently been cast apart by some\\nviolent subterranean commotion. The mass, giving way to some prodigious\\nupheaving of nature, had split in two, leaving the vast gap into which\\nwe inhabitants of the earth had penetrated for the first time.\\n\\nThe whole singular history of the coal period was written on those dark\\nand gloomy walls. A geologist would have been able easily to follow the\\ndifferent phases of its formation. The seams of coal were separated by\\nstrata of sandstone, a compact clay, which appeared to be crushed down\\nby the weight from above.\\n\\nAt that period of the world which preceded the secondary epoch, the\\nearth was covered by a coating of enormous and rich vegetation, due to\\nthe double action of tropical heat and perpetual humidity. A vast\\natmospheric cloud of vapor surrounded the earth on all sides, preventing\\nthe rays of the sun from ever reaching it.\\n\\nHence the conclusion that these intense heats did not arise from this\\nnew source of caloric.\\n\\nPerhaps even the star of day was not quite ready for its brilliant\\nwork--to illumine a universe. Climates did not as yet exist, and a level\\nheat pervaded the whole surface of the globe--the same heat existing at\\nthe North Pole as at the equator.\\n\\nWhence did it come? From the interior of the earth?\\n\\nIn spite of all the learned theories of Professor Hardwigg, a fierce and\\nvehement fire certainly burned within the entrails of the great\\nspheroid. Its action was felt even to the very topmost crust of the\\nearth; the plants then in existence, being deprived of the vivifying\\nrays of the sun, had neither buds, nor flowers, nor odor, but their\\nroots drew a strong and vigorous life from the burning earth of early\\ndays.\\n\\nThere were but few of what may be called trees--only herbaceous plants,\\nimmense turfs, briers, mosses, rare families, which, however, in those\\ndays were counted by tens and tens of thousands.\\n\\nIt is entirely to this exuberant vegetation that coal owes its origin.\\nThe crust of the vast globe still yielded under the influence of the\\nseething, boiling mass, which was forever at work beneath. Hence arose\\nnumerous fissures, and continual falling in of the upper earth. The\\ndense mass of plants being beneath the waters, soon formed themselves\\ninto vast agglomerations.\\n\\nThen came about the action of natural chemistry; in the depths of the\\nocean the vegetable mass at first became turf, then, thanks to the\\ninfluence of gases and subterranean fermentation, they underwent the\\ncomplete process of mineralization.\\n\\nIn this manner, in early days, were formed those vast and prodigious\\nlayers of coal, which an ever--increasing consumption must utterly use\\nup in about three centuries more, if people do not find some more\\neconomic light than gas, and some cheaper motive power than steam.\\n\\nAll these reflections, the memories of my school studies, came to my\\nmind while I gazed upon these mighty accumulations of coal, whose\\nriches, however, are scarcely likely to be ever utilized. The working of\\nthese mines could only be carried out at an expense that would never\\nyield a profit.\\n\\nThe matter, however, is scarcely worthy consideration, when coal is\\nscattered over the whole surface of the globe, within a few yards of the\\nupper crust. As I looked at these untouched strata, therefore, I knew\\nthey would remain as long as the world lasts.\\n\\nWhile we still continued our journey, I alone forgot the length of the\\nroad, by giving myself up wholly to these geological considerations. The\\ntemperature continued to be very much the same as while we were\\ntraveling amid the lava and the schists. On the other hand my sense of\\nsmell was much affected by a very powerful odor. I immediately knew that\\nthe gallery was filled to overflowing with that dangerous gas the miners\\ncall fire damp, the explosion of which has caused such fearful and\\nterrible accidents, making a hundred widows and hundreds of orphans in a\\nsingle hour.\\n\\nHappily, we were able to illumine our progress by means of the Ruhmkorff\\napparatus. If we had been so rash and imprudent as to explore this\\ngallery, torch in hand, a terrible explosion would have put an end to\\nour travels, simply because no travelers would be left.\\n\\nOur excursion through this wondrous coal mine in the very bowels of the\\nearth lasted until evening. My uncle was scarcely able to conceal his\\nimpatience and dissatisfaction at the road continuing still to advance\\nin a horizontal direction.\\n\\nThe darkness, dense and opaque a few yards in advance and in the rear,\\nrendered it impossible to make out what was the length of the gallery.\\nFor myself, I began to believe that it was simply interminable, and\\nwould go on in the same manner for months.\\n\\nSuddenly, at six o\\'clock, we stood in front of a wall. To the right, to\\nthe left above, below, nowhere was there any passage. We had reached a\\nspot where the rocks said in unmistakable accents--No Thoroughfare.\\n\\nI stood stupefied. The guide simply folded his arms. My uncle was\\nsilent.\\n\\n\"Well, well, so much the better,\" cried my uncle, at last, \"I now know\\nwhat we are about. We are decidedly not upon the road followed by\\nSaknussemm. All we have to do is to go back. Let us take one night\\'s\\ngood rest, and before three days are over, I promise you we shall have\\nregained the point where the galleries divided.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, we may, if our strength lasts as long,\" I cried, in a lamentable\\nvoice.\\n\\n\"And why not?\"\\n\\n\"Tomorrow, among us three, there will not be a drop of water. It is just\\ngone.\"\\n\\n\"And your courage with it,\" said my uncle, speaking in a severe tone.\\n\\nWhat could I say? I turned round on my side, and from sheer exhaustion\\nfell into a heavy sleep disturbed by dreams of water! And I awoke\\nunrefreshed.\\n\\nI would have bartered a diamond mine for a glass of pure spring water!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\nTHE WRONG ROAD!\\n\\n\\nNext day, our departure took place at a very early hour. There was no\\ntime for the least delay. According to my account, we had five days\\'\\nhard work to get back to the place where the galleries divided.\\n\\nI can never tell all the sufferings we endured upon our return. My uncle\\nbore them like a man who has been in the wrong--that is, with\\nconcentrated and suppressed anger; Hans, with all the resignation of his\\npacific character; and I--I confess that I did nothing but complain, and\\ndespair. I had no heart for this bad fortune.\\n\\nBut there was one consolation. Defeat at the outset would probably upset\\nthe whole journey!\\n\\nAs I had expected from the first, our supply of water gave completely\\nout on our first day\\'s march. Our provision of liquids was reduced to\\nour supply of Schiedam; but this horrible--nay, I will say it--this\\ninfernal liquor burnt the throat, and I could not even bear the sight of\\nit. I found the temperature to be stifling. I was paralyzed with\\nfatigue. More than once I was about to fall insensible to the ground.\\nThe whole party then halted, and the worthy Icelander and my excellent\\nuncle did their best to console and comfort me. I could, however,\\nplainly see that my uncle was contending painfully against the extreme\\nfatigues of our journey, and the awful torture generated by the absence\\nof water.\\n\\nAt length a time came when I ceased to recollect anything--when all was\\none awfull hideous, fantastic dream!\\n\\nAt last, on Tuesday, the seventh of the month of July, after crawling on\\nour hands and knees for many hours, more dead than alive, we reached the\\npoint of junction between the galleries. I lay like a log, an inert mass\\nof human flesh on the arid lava soil. It was then ten in the morning.\\n\\nHans and my uncle, leaning against the wall, tried to nibble away at\\nsome pieces of biscuit, while deep groans and sighs escaped from my\\nscorched and swollen lips. Then I fell off into a kind of deep lethargy.\\n\\nPresently I felt my uncle approach, and lift me up tenderly in his arms.\\n\\n\"Poor boy,\" I heard him say in a tone of deep commiseration.\\n\\nI was profoundly touched by these words, being by no means accustomed to\\nsigns of womanly weakness in the Professor. I caught his trembling hands\\nin mine and gave them a gentle pressure. He allowed me to do so without\\nresistance, looking at me kindly all the time. His eyes were wet with\\ntears.\\n\\nI then saw him take the gourd which he wore at his side. To my surprise,\\nor rather to my stupefaction, he placed it to my lips.\\n\\n\"Drink, my boy,\" he said.\\n\\nWas it possible my ears had not deceived me? Was my uncle mad? I looked\\nat him, with, I am sure, quite an idiotic expression. I could not\\nbelieve him. I too much feared the counteraction of disappointment.\\n\\n\"Drink,\" he said again.\\n\\nHad I heard aright? Before, however, I could ask myself the question a\\nsecond time, a mouthful of water cooled my parched lips and throat--one\\nmouthful, but I do believe it brought me back to life.\\n\\nI thanked my uncle by clasping my hands. My heart was too full to speak.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"one mouthful of water, the very last--do you hear, my\\nboy--the very last! I have taken care of it at the bottom of my bottle\\nas the apple of my eye. Twenty times, a hundred times, I have resisted\\nthe fearful desire to drink it. But--no--no, Harry, I saved it for you.\"\\n\\n\"My dear uncle,\" I exclaimed, and the big tears rolled down my hot and\\nfeverish cheeks.\\n\\n\"Yes, my poor boy, I knew that when you reached this place, this\\ncrossroad in the earth, you would fall down half dead, and I saved my\\nlast drop of water in order to restore you.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" I cried; \"thanks from my heart.\"\\n\\nAs little as my thirst was really quenched, I had nevertheless partially\\nrecovered my strength. The contracted muscles of my throat relaxed--and\\nthe inflammation of my lips in some measure subsided. At all events, I\\nwas able to speak.\\n\\n\"Well,\" I said, \"there can be no doubt now as to what we have to do.\\nWater has utterly failed us; our journey is therefore at an end. Let us\\nreturn.\"\\n\\nWhile I spoke thus, my uncle evidently avoided my face: he held down his\\nhead; his eyes were turned in every possible direction but the right\\none.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I continued, getting excited by my own words, \"we must go back to\\nSneffels. May heaven give us strength to enable us once more to revisit\\nthe light of day. Would that we now stood on the summit of the crater.\"\\n\\n\"Go back,\" said my uncle, speaking to himself, \"and must it be so?\"\\n\\n\"Go back--yes, and without losing a single moment,\" I vehemently cried.\\n\\nFor some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault.\\n\\n\"So, my dear Harry,\" said the Professor in a very singular tone of\\nvoice, \"those few drops of water have not sufficed to restore your\\nenergy and courage.\"\\n\\n\"Courage!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"I see that you are quite as downcast as before--and still give way to\\ndiscouragement and despair.\"\\n\\nWhat, then, was the man made of, and what other projects were entering\\nhis fertile and audacious brain!\\n\\n\"You are not discouraged, sir?\"\\n\\n\"What! Give up just as we are on the verge of success?\" he cried.\\n\"Never, never shall it be said that Professor Hardwigg retreated.\"\\n\\n\"Then we must make up our minds to perish,\" I cried with a helpless\\nsigh.\\n\\n\"No, Harry, my boy, certainly not. Go, leave me, I am very far from\\ndesiring your death. Take Hans with you. <i>I will go on alone.</i>\"\\n\\n\"You ask us to leave you?\"\\n\\n\"Leave me, I say. I have undertaken this dangerous and perilous\\nadventure. I will carry it to the end--or I will never return to the\\nsurface of Mother Earth. Go, Harry--once more I say to you--go!\"\\n\\nMy uncle as he spoke was terribly excited. His voice, which before had\\nbeen tender, almost womanly, became harsh and menacing. He appeared to\\nbe struggling with desperate energy against the impossible. I did not\\nwish to abandon him at the bottom of that abyss, while, on the other\\nhand, the instinct of preservation told me to fly.\\n\\nMeanwhile, our guide was looking on with profound calmness and\\nindifference. He appeared to be an unconcerned party, and yet he\\nperfectly well knew what was going on between us. Our gestures\\nsufficiently indicated the different roads each wished to follow--and\\nwhich each tried to influence the other to undertake. But Hans appeared\\nnot to take the slightest interest in what was really a question of life\\nand death for us all, but waited quite ready to obey the signal which\\nshould say go aloft, or to resume his desperate journey into the\\ninterior of the earth.\\n\\nHow then I wished with all my heart and soul that I could make him\\nunderstand my words. My representations, my sighs and groans, the\\nearnest accents in which I should have spoken would have convinced that\\ncold, hard nature. Those fearful dangers and perils of which the stolid\\nguide had no idea, I would have pointed them out to him--I would have,\\nas it were, made him see and feel. Between us, we might have convinced\\nthe obstinate Professor. If the worst had come to the worst, we could\\nhave compelled him to return to the summit of Sneffels.\\n\\nI quietly approached Hans. I caught his hand in mine. He never moved a\\nmuscle. I indicated to him the road to the top of the crater. He\\nremained motionless. My panting form, my haggard countenance, must have\\nindicated the extent of my sufferings. The Icelander gently shook his\\nhead and pointed to my uncle.\\n\\n\"Master,\" he said.\\n\\nThe word is Icelandic as well as English.\\n\\n\"The master!\" I cried, beside myself with fury--\"madman! no--I tell you\\nhe is not the master of our lives; we must fly! we must drag him with\\nus! do you hear me? Do you understand me, I say?\"\\n\\nI have already explained that I held Hans by the arm. I tried to make\\nhim rise from his seat. I struggled with him and tried to force him\\naway. My uncle now interposed.\\n\\n\"My good Henry, be calm,\" he said. \"You will obtain nothing from my\\ndevoted follower; therefore, listen to what I have to say.\"\\n\\nI folded my arms, as well as I could, and looked my uncle full in the\\nface.\\n\\n\"This wretched want of water,\" he said, \"is the sole obstacle to the\\nsuccess of my project. In the entire gallery, made of lava, schist, and\\ncoal, it is true we found not one liquid molecule. It is quite possible\\nthat we may be more fortunate in the western tunnel.\"\\n\\nMy sole reply was to shake my head with an air of deep incredulity.\\n\\n\"Listen to me to the end,\" said the Professor in his well-known\\nlecturing voice. \"While you lay yonder without life or motion, I\\nundertook a reconnoitering journey into the conformation of this other\\ngallery. I have discovered that it goes directly downwards into the\\nbowels of the earth, and in a few hours will take us to the old granitic\\nformation. In this we shall undoubtedly find innumerable springs. The\\nnature of the rock makes this a mathematical certainty, and instinct\\nagrees with logic to say that it is so. Now, this is the serious\\nproposition which I have to make to you. When Christopher Columbus asked\\nof his men three days to discover the land of promise, his men ill,\\nterrified, and hopeless, yet gave him three days--and the New World was\\ndiscovered. Now I, the Christopher Columbus of this subterranean region,\\nonly ask of you one more day. If, when that time is expired, I have not\\nfound the water of which we are in search, I swear to you, I will give\\nup my mighty enterprise and return to the earth\\'s surface.\"\\n\\nDespite my irritation and despair, I knew how much it cost my uncle to\\nmake this proposition, and to hold such conciliatory language. Under the\\ncircumstances, what could I do but yield?\\n\\n\"Well,\" I cried, \"let it be as you wish, and may heaven reward your\\nsuperhuman energy. But as, unless we discover water, our hours are\\nnumbered, let us lose no time, but go ahead.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\nTHE WESTERN GALLERY--A NEW ROUTE\\n\\n\\nOur descent was now resumed by means of the second gallery. Hans took up\\nhis post in front as usual. We had not gone more than a hundred yards\\nwhen the Professor carefully examined the walls.\\n\\n\"This is the primitive formation--we are on the right road--onwards is\\nour hope!\"\\n\\nWhen the whole earth got cool in the first hours of the world\\'s morning,\\nthe diminution of the volume of the earth produced a state of\\ndislocation in its upper crust, followed by ruptures, crevasses and\\nfissures. The passage was a fissure of this kind, through which, ages\\nago, had flowed the eruptive granite. The thousand windings and turnings\\nformed an inextricable labyrinth through the ancient soil.\\n\\nAs we descended, successions of layers composing the primitive soil\\nappeared with the utmost fidelity of detail. Geological science\\nconsiders this primitive soil as the base of the mineral crust, and it\\nhas recognized that it is composed of three different strata or layers,\\nall resting on the immovable rock known as granite.\\n\\nNo mineralogists had even found themselves placed in such a marvelous\\nposition to study nature in all her real and naked beauty. The sounding\\nrod, a mere machine, could not bring to the surface of the earth the\\nobjects of value for the study of its internal structure, which we were\\nabout to see with our own eyes, to touch with our own hands.\\n\\nRemember that I am writing this after the journey.\\n\\nAcross the streak of the rocks, colored by beautiful green tints, wound\\nmetallic threads of copper, of manganese, with traces of platinum and\\ngold. I could not help gazing at these riches buried in the entrails of\\nMother Earth, and of which no man would have the enjoyment to the end of\\ntime! These treasures--mighty and inexhaustible, were buried in the\\nmorning of the earth\\'s history, at such awful depths, that no crowbar or\\npickax will ever drag them from their tomb!\\n\\nThe light of our Ruhmkorff\\'s coil, increased tenfold by the myriad of\\nprismatic masses of rock, sent its jets of fire in every direction, and\\nI could fancy myself traveling through a huge hollow diamond, the rays\\nof which produced myriads of extraordinary effects.\\n\\nTowards six o\\'clock, this festival of light began sensibly and visibly\\nto decrease, and soon almost ceased. The sides of the gallery assumed a\\ncrystallized tint, with a somber hue; white mica began to commingle more\\nfreely with feldspar and quartz, to form what may be called the true\\nrock--the stone which is hard above all, that supports, without being\\ncrushed, the four stories of the earth\\'s soil.\\n\\nWe were walled by an immense prison of granite!\\n\\nIt was now eight o\\'clock, and still there was no sign of water. The\\nsufferings I endured were horrible. My uncle now kept at the head of our\\nlittle column. Nothing could induce him to stop. I, meanwhile, had but\\none real thought. My ear was keenly on the watch to catch the sound of a\\nspring. But no pleasant sound of falling water fell upon my listening\\near.\\n\\nBut at last the time came when my limbs refused to carry me longer. I\\ncontended heroically against the terrible tortures I endured, because I\\ndid not wish to compel my uncle to halt. To him I knew this would be the\\nlast fatal stroke.\\n\\nSuddenly I felt a deadly faintness come over me. My eyes could no longer\\nsee; my knees shook. I gave one despairing cry--and fell!\\n\\n\"Help, help, I am dying!\"\\n\\nMy uncle turned and slowly retraced his steps. He looked at me with\\nfolded arms, and then allowed one sentence to escape, in hollow accents,\\nfrom his lips:\\n\\n\"All is over.\"\\n\\nThe last thing I saw was a face fearfully distorted with pain and\\nsorrow; and then my eyes closed.\\n\\n\\nWhen I again opened them, I saw my companions lying near me, motionless,\\nwrapped in their huge traveling rugs. Were they asleep or dead? For\\nmyself, sleep was wholly out of the question. My fainting fit over, I\\nwas wakeful as the lark. I suffered too much for sleep to visit my\\neyelids--the more, that I thought myself sick unto death--dying. The\\nlast words spoken by my uncle seemed to be buzzing in my ears--all is\\nover! And it was probable that he was right. In the state of prostration\\nto which I was reduced, it was madness to think of ever again seeing the\\nlight of day.\\n\\nAbove were miles upon miles of the earth\\'s crust. As I thought of it, I\\ncould fancy the whole weight resting on my shoulders. I was crushed,\\nannihilated! and exhausted myself in vain attempts to turn in my granite\\nbed.\\n\\nHours upon hours passed away. A profound and terrible silence reigned\\naround us--a silence of the tomb. Nothing could make itself heard\\nthrough these gigantic walls of granite. The very thought was\\nstupendous.\\n\\nPresently, despite my apathy, despite the kind of deadly calm into which\\nI was cast, something aroused me. It was a slight but peculiar noise.\\nWhile I was watching intently, I observed that the tunnel was becoming\\ndark. Then gazing through the dim light that remained, I thought I saw\\nthe Icelander taking his departure, lamp in hand.\\n\\nWhy had he acted thus? Did Hans the guide mean to abandon us? My uncle\\nlay fast asleep--or dead. I tried to cry out, and arouse him. My voice,\\nfeebly issuing from my parched and fevered lips, found no echo in that\\nfearful place. My throat was dry, my tongue stuck to the roof of my\\nmouth. The obscurity had by this time become intense, and at last even\\nthe faint sound of the guide\\'s footsteps was lost in the blank distance.\\nMy soul seemed filled with anguish, and death appeared welcome, only let\\nit come quickly.\\n\\n\"Hans is leaving us,\" I cried. \"Hans--Hans, if you are a man, come\\nback.\"\\n\\nThese words were spoken to myself. They could not be heard aloud.\\nNevertheless, after the first few moments of terror were over, I was\\nashamed of my suspicions against a man who hitherto had behaved so\\nadmirably. Nothing in his conduct or character justified suspicion.\\nMoreover, a moment\\'s reflection reassured me. His departure could not be\\na flight. Instead of ascending the gallery, he was going deeper down\\ninto the gulf. Had he had any bad design, his way would have been\\nupwards.\\n\\nThis reasoning calmed me a little and I began to hope!\\n\\nThe good, and peaceful, and imperturbable Hans would certainly not have\\narisen from his sleep without some serious and grave motive. Was he bent\\non a voyage of discovery? During the deep, still silence of the night\\nhad he at last heard that sweet murmur about which we were all so\\nanxious?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\nWATER, WHERE IS IT? A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT\\n\\n\\nDuring a long, long, weary hour, there crossed my wildly delirious brain\\nall sorts of reasons as to what could have aroused our quiet and\\nfaithful guide. The most absurd and ridiculous ideas passed through my\\nhead, each more impossible than the other. I believe I was either half\\nor wholly mad.\\n\\nSuddenly, however, there arose, as it were from the depths of the earth,\\na voice of comfort. It was the sound of footsteps! Hans was returning.\\n\\nPresently the uncertain light began to shine upon the walls of the\\npassage, and then it came in view far down the sloping tunnel. At length\\nHans himself appeared.\\n\\nHe approached my uncle, placed his hand upon his shoulder, and gently\\nawakened him. My uncle, as soon as he saw who it was, instantly arose.\\n\\n\"Well!\" exclaimed the Professor.\\n\\n\"Vatten,\" said the hunter.\\n\\nI did not know a single word of the Danish language, and yet by a sort\\nof mysterious instinct I understood what the guide had said.\\n\\n\"Water, water!\" I cried, in a wild and frantic tone, clapping my hands,\\nand gesticulating like a madman.\\n\\n\"Water!\" murmured my uncle, in a voice of deep emotion and gratitude.\\n\"Hvar?\" (\"Where?\")\\n\\n\"Nedat.\" (\"Below.\")\\n\\n\"Where? below!\" I understood every word. I had caught the hunter by the\\nhands, and I shook them heartily, while he looked on with perfect\\ncalmness.\\n\\nThe preparations for our departure did not take long, and we were soon\\nmaking a rapid descent into the tunnel.\\n\\nAn hour later we had advanced a thousand yards, and descended two\\nthousand feet.\\n\\nAt this moment I heard an accustomed and well-known sound running along\\nthe floors of the granite rock--a kind of dull and sullen roar, like\\nthat of a distant waterfall.\\n\\nDuring the first half hour of our advance, not finding the discovered\\nspring, my feelings of intense suffering appeared to return. Once more I\\nbegan to lose all hope. My uncle, however, observing how downhearted I\\nwas again becoming, took up the conversation.\\n\\n\"Hans was right,\" he exclaimed enthusiastically; \"that is the dull\\nroaring of a torrent.\"\\n\\n\"A torrent,\" I cried, delighted at even hearing the welcome words.\\n\\n\"There\\'s not the slightest doubt about it,\" he replied, \"a subterranean\\nriver is flowing beside us.\"\\n\\nI made no reply, but hastened on, once more animated by hope. I began\\nnot even to feel the deep fatigue which hitherto had overpowered me. The\\nvery sound of this glorious murmuring water already refreshed me. We\\ncould hear it increasing in volume every moment. The torrent, which for\\na long time could be heard flowing over our heads, now ran distinctly\\nalong the left wall, roaring, rushing, spluttering, and still falling.\\n\\nSeveral times I passed my hand across the rock hoping to find some trace\\nof humidity--of the slightest percolation. Alas! in vain.\\n\\nAgain a half hour passed in the same weary toil. Again we advanced.\\n\\nIt now became evident that the hunter, during his absence, had not been\\nable to carry his researches any farther. Guided by an instinct peculiar\\nto the dwellers in mountain regions and water finders, he \"smelt\" the\\nliving spring through the rock. Still he had not seen the precious\\nliquid. He had neither quenched his own thirst, nor brought us one drop\\nin his gourd.\\n\\nMoreover, we soon made the disastrous discovery that, if our progress\\ncontinued, we should soon be moving away from the torrent, the sound of\\nwhich gradually diminished. We turned back. Hans halted at the precise\\nspot where the sound of the torrent appeared nearest.\\n\\nI could bear the suspense and suffering no longer, and seated myself\\nagainst the wall, behind which I could hear the water seething and\\neffervescing not two feet away. But a solid wall of granite still\\nseparated us from it!\\n\\nHans looked keenly at me, and, strange enough, for once I thought I saw\\na smile on his imperturbable face.\\n\\nHe rose from a stone on which he had been seated, and took up the lamp.\\nI could not help rising and following. He moved slowly along the firm\\nand solid granite wall. I watched him with mingled curiosity and\\neagerness. Presently he halted and placed his ear against the dry stone,\\nmoving slowly along and listening with the most extreme care and\\nattention. I understood at once that he was searching for the exact spot\\nwhere the torrent\\'s roar was most plainly heard. This point he soon\\nfound in the lateral wall on the left side, about three feet above the\\nlevel of the tunnel floor.\\n\\nI was in a state of intense excitement. I scarcely dared believe what\\nthe eider-duck hunter was about to do. It was, however, impossible in a\\nmoment more not to both understand and applaud, and even to smother him\\nin my embraces, when I saw him raise the heavy crowbar and commence an\\nattack upon the rock itself.\\n\\n\"Saved!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" cried my uncle, even more excited and delighted than myself;\\n\"Hans is quite right. Oh, the worthy, excellent man! We should never\\nhave thought of such an idea.\"\\n\\nAnd nobody else, I think, would have done so. Such a process, simple as\\nit seemed, would most certainly not have entered our heads. Nothing\\ncould be more dangerous than to begin to work with pickaxes in that\\nparticular part of the globe. Supposing while he was at work a break-up\\nwere to take place, and supposing the torrent once having gained an inch\\nwere to take an ell, and come pouring bodily through the broken rock!\\n\\nNot one of these dangers was chimerical. They were only too real. But at\\nthat moment no fear of falling in of the roof, or even of inundation was\\ncapable of stopping us. Our thirst was so intense that to quench it we\\nwould have dug below the bed of old Ocean itself.\\n\\nHans went quietly to work--a work which neither my uncle nor I would\\nhave undertaken at any price. Our impatience was so great that if we had\\nonce begun with pickax and crowbar, the rock would soon have split into\\na hundred fragments. The guide, on the contrary, calm, ready, moderate,\\nwore away the hard rock by little steady blows of his instrument, making\\nno attempt at a larger hole than about six inches. As I stood, I heard,\\nor I thought I heard, the roar of the torrent momentarily increasing in\\nloudness, and at times I almost felt the pleasant sensation of water\\nupon my parched lips.\\n\\nAt the end of what appeared an age, Hans had made a hole which enabled\\nhis crowbar to enter two feet into the solid rock. He had been at work\\nexactly an hour. It appeared a dozen. I was getting wild with\\nimpatience. My uncle began to think of using more violent measures. I\\nhad the greatest difficulty in checking him. He had indeed just got hold\\nof his crowbar when a loud and welcome hiss was heard. Then a stream, or\\nrather jet, of water burst through the wall and came out with such force\\nas to hit the opposite side!\\n\\nHans, the guide, who was half upset by the shock, was scarcely able to\\nkeep down a cry of pain and grief. I understood his meaning when,\\nplunging my hands into the sparkling jet, I myself gave a wild and\\nfrantic cry. The water was scalding hot!\\n\\n\"Boiling,\" I cried, in bitter disappointment.\\n\\n\"Well, never mind,\" said my uncle, \"it will soon get cool.\"\\n\\nThe tunnel began to be filled by clouds of vapor, while a small stream\\nran away into the interior of the earth. In a short time we had some\\nsufficiently cool to drink. We swallowed it in huge mouthfuls.\\n\\nOh! what exalted delight--what rich and incomparable luxury! What was\\nthis water, whence did it come? To us what was that? The simple fact\\nwas--it was water; and, though still with a tingle of warmth about it,\\nit brought back to the heart, that life which, but for it, must surely\\nhave faded away. I drank greedily, almost without tasting it.\\n\\nWhen, however, I had almost quenched my ravenous thirst, I made a\\ndiscovery.\\n\\n\"Why, it is chalybeate water!\"\\n\\n\"A most excellent stomachic,\" replied my uncle, \"and highly mineralized.\\nHere is a journey worth twenty to Spa.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s very good,\" I replied.\\n\\n\"I should think so. Water found six miles under ground. There is a\\npeculiarly inky flavor about it, which is by no means disagreeable. Hans\\nmay congratulate himself on having made a rare discovery. What do you\\nsay, nephew, according to the usual custom of travelers, to name the\\nstream after him?\"\\n\\n\"Good,\" said I. And the name of \"Hansbach\" (\"Hans Brook\") was at once\\nagreed upon.\\n\\nHans was not a bit more proud after hearing our determination than he\\nwas before. After having taken a very small modicum of the welcome\\nrefreshment, he had seated himself in a corner with his usual\\nimperturbable gravity.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said I, \"it is not worth while letting this water run to waste.\"\\n\\n\"What is the use,\" replied my uncle, \"the source from which this river\\nrises is inexhaustible.\"\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" I continued, \"let us fill our goatskin and gourds, and\\nthen try to stop the opening up.\"\\n\\nMy advice, after some hesitation, was followed or attempted to be\\nfollowed. Hans picked up all the broken pieces of granite he had knocked\\nout, and using some tow he happened to have about him, tried to shut up\\nthe fissure he had made in the wall. All he did was to scald his hands.\\nThe pressure was too great, and all our attempts were utter failures.\\n\\n\"It is evident,\" I remarked, \"that the upper surface of these springs is\\nsituated at a very great height above--as we may fairly infer from the\\ngreat pressure of the jet.\"\\n\\n\"That is by no means doubtful,\" replied my uncle, \"if this column of\\nwater is about thirty-two thousand feet high, the atmospheric pressure\\nmust be something enormous. But a new idea has just struck me.\"\\n\\n\"And what is that?\"\\n\\n\"Why be at so much trouble to close this aperture?\"\\n\\n\"Because--\"\\n\\nI hesitated and stammered, having no real reason.\\n\\n\"When our water bottles are empty, we are not at all sure that we shall\\nbe able to fill them,\" observed my uncle.\\n\\n\"I think that is very probable.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, let this water run. It will, of course, naturally follow in\\nour track, and will serve to guide and refresh us.\"\\n\\n\"I think the idea a good one,\" I cried in reply, \"and with this rivulet\\nas a companion, there is no further reason why we should not succeed in\\nour marvelous project.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, my boy,\" said the Professor, laughing, \"after all, you are coming\\nround.\"\\n\\n\"More than that, I am now confident of ultimate success.\"\\n\\n\"One moment, nephew mine. Let us begin by taking some hours of repose.\"\\n\\nI had utterly forgotten that it was night. The chronometer, however,\\ninformed me of the fact. Soon we were sufficiently restored and\\nrefreshed, and had all fallen into a profound sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\nUNDER THE OCEAN\\n\\n\\nBy the next day we had nearly forgotten our past sufferings. The first\\nsensation I experienced was surprise at not being thirsty, and I\\nactually asked myself the reason. The running stream, which flowed in\\nrippling wavelets at my feet, was the satisfactory reply.\\n\\nWe breakfasted with a good appetite, and then drank our fill of the\\nexcellent water. I felt myself quite a new man, ready to go anywhere my\\nuncle chose to lead. I began to think. Why should not a man as seriously\\nconvinced as my uncle, succeed, with so excellent a guide as worthy\\nHans, and so devoted a nephew as myself? These were the brilliant ideas\\nwhich now invaded my brain. Had the proposition now been made to go back\\nto the summit of Mount Sneffels, I should have declined the offer in a\\nmost indignant manner.\\n\\nBut fortunately there was no question of going up. We were about to\\ndescend farther into the interior of the earth.\\n\\n\"Let us be moving,\" I cried, awakening the echoes of the old world.\\n\\nWe resumed our march on Thursday at eight o\\'clock in the morning. The\\ngreat granite tunnel, as it went round by sinuous and winding ways,\\npresented every now and then sharp turns, and in fact all the appearance\\nof a labyrinth. Its direction, however, was in general towards the\\nsouthwest. My uncle made several pauses in order to consult his compass.\\n\\nThe gallery now began to trend downwards in a horizontal direction, with\\nabout two inches of fall in every furlong. The murmuring stream flowed\\nquietly at our feet. I could not but compare it to some familiar spirit,\\nguiding us through the earth, and I dabbled my fingers in its tepid\\nwater, which sang like a naiad as we progressed. My good humor began to\\nassume a mythological character.\\n\\nAs for my uncle he began to complain of the horizontal character of the\\nroad. His route, he found, began to be indefinitely prolonged, instead\\nof \"sliding down the celestial ray,\" according to his expression.\\n\\nBut we had no choice; and as long as our road led towards the\\ncentre--however little progress we made, there was no reason to\\ncomplain.\\n\\nMoreover, from time to time the slopes were much greater, the naiad sang\\nmore loudly, and we began to dip downwards in earnest.\\n\\nAs yet, however, I felt no painful sensation. I had not got over the\\nexcitement of the discovery of water.\\n\\nThat day and the next we did a considerable amount of horizontal, and\\nrelatively very little vertical, traveling.\\n\\nOn Friday evening, the tenth of July, according to our estimation, we\\nought to have been thirty leagues to the southeast of Reykjavik, and\\nabout two leagues and a half deep. We now received a rather startling\\nsurprise.\\n\\nUnder our feet there opened a horrible well. My uncle was so delighted\\nthat he actually clapped his hands--as he saw how steep and sharp was\\nthe descent.\\n\\n\"Ah, ah!\" he cried, in rapturous delight; \"this will take us a long way.\\nLook at the projections of the rock. Hah!\" he exclaimed, \"it\\'s a fearful\\nstaircase!\"\\n\\nHans, however, who in all our troubles had never given up the ropes,\\ntook care so to dispose of them as to prevent any accidents. Our descent\\nthen began. I dare not call it a perilous descent, for I was already too\\nfamiliar with that sort of work to look upon it as anything but a very\\nordinary affair.\\n\\nThis well was a kind of narrow opening in the massive granite of the\\nkind known as a fissure. The contraction of the terrestrial scaffolding,\\nwhen it suddenly cooled, had been evidently the cause. If it had ever\\nserved in former times as a kind of funnel through which passed the\\neruptive masses vomited by Sneffels, I was at a loss to explain how it\\nhad left no mark. We were, in fact, descending a spiral, something like\\nthose winding staircases in use in modern houses.\\n\\nWe were compelled every quarter of an hour or thereabouts to sit down in\\norder to rest our legs. Our calves ached. We then seated ourselves on\\nsome projecting rock with our legs hanging over, and gossiped while we\\nate a mouthful--drinking still from the pleasantly warm running stream\\nwhich had not deserted us.\\n\\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that in this curiously shaped fissure\\nthe Hansbach had become a cascade to the detriment of its size. It was\\nstill, however, sufficient, and more, for our wants. Besides we knew\\nthat, as soon as the declivity ceased to be so abrupt, the stream must\\nresume its peaceful course. At this moment it reminded me of my uncle,\\nhis impatience and rage, while when it flowed more peacefully, I\\npictured to myself the placidity of the Icelandic guide.\\n\\nDuring the whole of two days, the sixth and seventh of July, we followed\\nthe extraordinary spiral staircase of the fissure, penetrating two\\nleagues farther into the crust of the earth, which put us five leagues\\nbelow the level of the sea. On the eighth, however, at twelve o\\'clock in\\nthe day, the fissure suddenly assumed a much more gentle slope still\\ntrending in a southeast direction.\\n\\nThe road now became comparatively easy, and at the same time dreadfully\\nmonotonous. It would have been difficult for matters to have turned out\\notherwise. Our peculiar journey had no chance of being diversified by\\nlandscape and scenery. At all events, such was my idea.\\n\\nAt length, on Wednesday the fifteenth, we were actually seven leagues\\n(twenty-one miles) below the surface of the earth, and fifty leagues\\ndistant from the mountain of Sneffels. Though, if the truth be told, we\\nwere very tired, our health had resisted all suffering, and was in a\\nmost satisfactory state. Our traveler\\'s box of medicaments had not even\\nbeen opened.\\n\\nMy uncle was careful to note every hour the indications of the compass,\\nof the manometer, and of the thermometer, all which he afterwards\\npublished in his elaborate philosophical and scientific account of our\\nremarkable voyage. He was therefore able to give an exact relation of\\nthe situation. When, therefore, he informed me that we were fifty\\nleagues in a horizontal direction distant from our starting point, I\\ncould not suppress a loud exclamation.\\n\\n\"What is the matter now?\" cried my uncle.\\n\\n\"Nothing very important, only an idea has entered my head,\" was my\\nreply.\\n\\n\"Well, out with it, My boy.\"\\n\\n\"It is my opinion that if your calculations are correct we are no longer\\nunder Iceland.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\"\\n\\n\"We can very easily find out,\" I replied, pulling out a map and\\ncompasses.\\n\\n\"You see,\" I said, after careful measurement, \"that I am not mistaken.\\nWe are far beyond Cape Portland; and those fifty leagues to the\\nsoutheast will take us into the open sea.\"\\n\\n\"Under the open sea,\" cried my uncle, rubbing his hands with a delighted\\nair.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I cried, \"no doubt old Ocean flows over our heads!\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear boy, what can be more natural! Do you not know that in\\nthe neighborhood of Newcastle there are coal mines which have been\\nworked far out under the sea?\"\\n\\nNow my worthy uncle, the Professor, no doubt regarded this discovery as\\na very simple fact, but to me the idea was by no means a pleasant one.\\nAnd yet when one came to think the matter over seriously, what mattered\\nit whether the plains and mountains of Iceland were suspended over our\\ndevoted heads, or the mighty billows of the Atlantic Ocean? The whole\\nquestion rested on the solidity of the granite roof above us. However, I\\nsoon got used to the ideal for the passage now level, now running down,\\nand still always to the southeast, kept going deeper and deeper into the\\nprofound abysses of Mother Earth.\\n\\nThree days later, on the eighteenth day of July, on a Saturday, we\\nreached a kind of vast grotto. My uncle here paid Hans his usual\\nrix-dollars, and it was decided that the next day should be a day of\\nrest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\nSUNDAY BELOW GROUND\\n\\n\\nI Awoke on Sunday morning without any sense of hurry and bustle\\nattendant on an immediate departure. Though the day to be devoted to\\nrepose and reflection was spent under such strange circumstances, and in\\nso wonderful a place, the idea was a pleasant one. Besides, we all began\\nto get used to this kind of existence. I had almost ceased to think of\\nthe sun, of the moon, of the stars, of the trees, houses, and towns; in\\nfact, about any terrestrial necessities. In our peculiar position we\\nwere far above such reflections.\\n\\nThe grotto was a vast and magnificent hall. Along its granitic soil the\\nstream flowed placidly and pleasantly. So great a distance was it now\\nfrom its fiery source that its water was scarcely lukewarm, and could be\\ndrunk without delay or difficulty.\\n\\nAfter a frugal breakfast, the Professor made up his mind to devote some\\nhours to putting his notes and calculations in order.\\n\\n\"In the first place,\" he said, \"I have a good many to verify and prove,\\nin order that we may know our exact position. I wish to be able on our\\nreturn to the upper regions to make a map of our journey, a kind of\\nvertical section of the globe, which will be, as it were, the profile of\\nthe expedition.\"\\n\\n\"That would indeed be a curious work, Uncle; but can you make your\\nobservations with anything like certainty and precision?\"\\n\\n\"I can. I have never on any occasion failed to note with great care the\\nangles and slopes. I am certain as to having made no mistake. Take the\\ncompass and examine how she points.\"\\n\\nI looked at the instrument with care.\\n\\n\"East one quarter southeast.\"\\n\\n\"Very good,\" resumed the Professor, noting the observation, and going\\nthrough some rapid calculations. \"I make out that we have journeyed two\\nhundred and fifty miles from the point of our departure.\"\\n\\n\"Then the mighty waves of the Atlantic are rolling over our heads?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n\"And at this very moment it is possible that fierce tempests are raging\\nabove, and that men and ships are battling against the angry blasts just\\nover our heads?\"\\n\\n\"It is quite within the range of possibility,\" rejoined my uncle,\\nsmiling.\\n\\n\"And that whales are playing in shoals, thrashing the bottom of the sea,\\nthe roof of our adamantine prison?\"\\n\\n\"Be quite at rest on that point; there is no danger of their breaking\\nthrough. But to return to our calculations. We are to the southeast, two\\nhundred and fifty miles from the base of Sneffels, and, according to my\\npreceding notes, I think we have gone sixteen leagues in a downward\\ndirection.\"\\n\\n\"Sixteen leagues--fifty miles!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"I am sure of it.\"\\n\\n\"But that is the extreme limit allowed by science for the thickness of\\nthe earth\\'s crust,\" I replied, referring to my geological studies.\\n\\n\"I do not contravene that assertion,\" was his quiet answer.\\n\\n\"And at this stage of our journey, according to all known laws on the\\nincrease of heat, there should be here a temperature of <i>fifteen hundred\\ndegrees of Reaumur</i>.\"\\n\\n\"There should be--you say, my boy.\"\\n\\n\"In which case this granite would not exist, but be in a state of\\nfusion.\"\\n\\n\"But you perceive, my boy, that it is not so, and that facts, as usual,\\nare very stubborn things, overruling all theories.\"\\n\\n\"I am forced to yield to the evidence of my senses, but I am\\nnevertheless very much surprised.\"\\n\\n\"What heat does the thermometer really indicate?\" continued the\\nphilosopher.\\n\\n\"Twenty-seven six-tenths.\"\\n\\n\"So that science is wrong by fourteen hundred and seventy-four degrees\\nand four-tenths. According to which, it is demonstrated that the\\nproportional increase in temperature is an exploded error. Humphry Davy\\nhere shines forth in all his glory. He is right, and I have acted wisely\\nto believe him. Have you any answer to make to this statement?\"\\n\\nHad I chosen to have spoken, I might have said a great deal. I in no way\\nadmitted the theory of Humphry Davy--I still held out for the theory of\\nproportional increase of heat, though I did not feel it.\\n\\nI was far more willing to allow that this chimney of an extinct volcano\\nwas covered by lava of a kind refractory to heat--in fact a bad\\nconductor--which did not allow the great increase of temperature to\\npercolate through its sides. The hot water jet supported my view of the\\nmatter.\\n\\nBut without entering on a long and useless discussion, or seeking for\\nnew arguments to controvert my uncle, I contented myself with taking up\\nfacts as they were.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, I take for granted that all your calculations are correct,\\nbut allow me to draw from them a rigorous and definite conclusion.\"\\n\\n\"Go on, my boy--have your say,\" cried my uncle goodhumoredly.\\n\\n\"At the place where we now are, under the latitude of Iceland, the\\nterrestrial depth is about fifteen hundred and eighty-three leagues.\"\\n\\n\"Fifteen hundred eighty-three and a quarter.\"\\n\\n\"Well, suppose we say sixteen hundred in round numbers. Now, out of a\\nvoyage of sixteen hundred leagues we have completed sixteen.\"\\n\\n\"As you say, what then?\"\\n\\n\"At the expense of a diagonal journey of no less than eighty-five\\nleagues.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly.\"\\n\\n\"We have been twenty days about it.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly twenty days.\"\\n\\n\"Now sixteen is the hundredth part of our contemplated expedition. If we\\ngo on in this way we shall be two thousand days, that is about five\\nyears and a half, going down.\"\\n\\nThe Professor folded his arms, listened, but did not speak.\\n\\n\"Without counting that if a vertical descent of sixteen leagues costs us\\na horizontal of eighty-five, we shall have to go about eight thousand\\nleagues to the southeast, and we must therefore come out somewhere in\\nthe circumference long before we can hope to reach the centre.\"\\n\\n\"Bother your calculations,\" cried my uncle in one of his old rages. \"On\\nwhat basis do they rest? How do you know that this passage does not take\\nus direct to the end we require? Moreover, I have in my favor,\\nfortunately, a precedent. What I have undertaken to do, another has\\ndone, and he having succeeded, why should I not be equally successful?\"\\n\\n\"I hope, indeed, you will, but still, I suppose I may be allowed to--\"\\n\\n\"You are allowed to hold your tongue,\" cried Professor Hardwigg, \"when\\nyou talk so unreasonably as this.\"\\n\\nI saw at once that the old doctorial Professor was still alive in my\\nuncle--and fearful to rouse his angry passions, I dropped the unpleasant\\nsubject.\\n\\n\"Now, then,\" he explained, \"consult the manometer. What does that\\nindicate?\"\\n\\n\"A considerable amount of pressure.\"\\n\\n\"Very good. You see, then, that by descending slowly, and by gradually\\naccustoming ourselves to the density of this lower atmosphere, we shall\\nnot suffer.\"\\n\\n\"Well, I suppose not, except it may be a certain amount of pain in the\\nears,\" was my rather grim reply.\\n\\n\"That, my dear boy, is nothing, and you will easily get rid of that\\nsource of discomfort by bringing the exterior air in communication with\\nthe air contained in your lungs.\"\\n\\n\"Perfectly,\" said I, for I had quite made up my mind in no wise to\\ncontradict my uncle. \"I should fancy almost that I should experience a\\ncertain amount of satisfaction in making a plunge into this dense\\natmosphere. Have you taken note of how wonderfully sound is propagated?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I have. There can be no doubt that a journey into the\\ninterior of the earth would be an excellent cure for deafness.\"\\n\\n\"But then, Uncle,\" I ventured mildly to observe, \"this density will\\ncontinue to increase.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--according to a law which, however, is scarcely defined. It is true\\nthat the intensity of weight will diminish just in proportion to the\\ndepth to which we go. You know very well that it is on the surface of\\nthe earth that its action is most powerfully felt, while on the\\ncontrary, in the very centre of the earth bodies cease to have any\\nweight at all.\"\\n\\n\"I know that is the case, but as we progress will not the atmosphere\\nfinally assume the density of water?\"\\n\\n\"I know it; when placed under the pressure of seven hundred and ten\\natmospheres,\" cried my uncle with imperturbable gravity.\\n\\n\"And when we are still lower down?\" I asked with natural anxiety.\\n\\n\"Well, lower down, the density will become even greater.\"\\n\\n\"Then how shall we be able to make our way through this atmospheric\\nfog?\"\\n\\n\"Well, my worthy nephew, we must ballast ourselves by filling our\\npockets with stones,\" said Professor Hardwigg.\\n\\n\"Faith, Uncle, you have an answer for everything,\" was my only reply.\\n\\nI began to feel that it was unwise of me to go any farther into the wide\\nfield of hypotheses for I should certainly have revived some difficulty,\\nor rather impossibility, that would have enraged the Professor.\\n\\nIt was evident, nevertheless, that the air under a pressure which might\\nbe multiplied by thousands of atmospheres, would end by becoming\\nperfectly solid, and that then admitting our bodies resisted the\\npressure, we should have to stop, in spite of all the reasonings in the\\nworld. Facts overcome all arguments.\\n\\nBut I thought it best not to urge this argument. My uncle would simply\\nhave quoted the example of Saknussemm. Supposing the learned Icelander\\'s\\njourney ever really to have taken place--there was one simple answer to\\nbe made:\\n\\nIn the sixteenth century neither the barometer nor the manometer had\\nbeen invented--how, then, could Saknussemm have been able to discover\\nwhen he did reach the centre of the earth?\\n\\nThis unanswerable and learned objection I, however, kept to myself and,\\nbracing up my courage, awaited the course of events--little aware of how\\nadventurous yet were to be the incidents of our remarkable journey.\\n\\nThe rest of this day of leisure and repose was spent in calculation and\\nconversation. I made it a point to agree with the Professor in\\neverything; but I envied the perfect indifference of Hans, who, without\\ntaking any such trouble about the cause and effect, went blindly onwards\\nwherever destiny chose to lead him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\nALONE\\n\\n\\nIt must in all truth be confessed, things as yet had gone on well, and I\\nshould have acted in bad taste to have complained. If the true medium of\\nour difficulties did not increase, it was within the range of\\npossibility that we might ultimately reach the end of our journey. Then\\nwhat glory would be ours! I began in the newly aroused ardor of my soul\\nto speak enthusiastically to the Professor. Well, was I serious? The\\nwhole state in which we existed was a mystery--and it was impossible to\\nknow whether or not I was in earnest.\\n\\nFor several days after our memorable halt, the slopes became more\\nrapid--some were even of a most frightful character--almost vertical, so\\nthat we were forever going down into the solid interior mass. During\\nsome days, we actually descended a league and a half, even two leagues\\ntowards the centre of the earth. The descents were sufficiently\\nperilous, and while we were engaged in them we learned fully to\\nappreciate the marvelous coolness of our guide, Hans. Without him we\\nshould have been wholly lost. The grave and impassible Icelander devoted\\nhimself to us with the most incomprehensible sang-froid and ease; and,\\nthanks to him, many a dangerous pass was got over, where, but for him,\\nwe should inevitably have stuck fast.\\n\\nHis silence increased every day. I think that we began to be influenced\\nby this peculiar trait in his character. It is certain that the\\ninanimate objects by which you are surrounded have a direct action on\\nthe brain. It must be that a man who shuts himself up between four walls\\nmust lose the faculty of associating ideas and words. How many persons\\ncondemned to the horrors of solitary confinement have gone mad--simply\\nbecause the thinking faculties have lain dormant!\\n\\nDuring the two weeks that followed our last interesting conversation,\\nthere occurred nothing worthy of being especially recorded.\\n\\nI have, while writing these memoirs, taxed my memory in vain for one\\nincident of travel during this particular period.\\n\\nBut the next event to be related is terrible indeed. Its very memory,\\neven now, makes my soul shudder, and my blood run cold.\\n\\nIt was on the seventh of August. Our constant and successive descents\\nhad taken us quite thirty leagues into the interior of the earth, that\\nis to say that there were above us thirty leagues, nearly a hundred\\nmiles, of rocks, and oceans, and continents, and towns, to say nothing\\nof living inhabitants. We were in a southeasterly direction, about two\\nhundred leagues from Iceland.\\n\\nOn that memorable day the tunnel had begun to assume an almost\\nhorizontal course.\\n\\nI was on this occasion walking on in front. My uncle had charge of one\\nof the Ruhmkorff coils, I had possession of the other. By means of its\\nlight I was busy examining the different layers of granite. I was\\ncompletely absorbed in my work.\\n\\nSuddenly halting and turning round, I found that I was alone!\\n\\n\"Well,\" thought I to myself, \"I have certainly been walking too fast--or\\nelse Hans and my uncle have stopped to rest. The best thing I can do is\\nto go back and find them. Luckily, there is very little ascent to tire\\nme.\"\\n\\nI accordingly retraced my steps and, while doing so, walked for at least\\na quarter of an hour. Rather uneasy, I paused and looked eagerly around.\\nNot a living soul. I called aloud. No reply. My voice was lost amid the\\nmyriad cavernous echoes it aroused!\\n\\nI began for the first time to feel seriously uneasy. A cold shiver shook\\nmy whole body, and perspiration, chill and terrible, burst upon my skin.\\n\\n\"I must be calm,\" I said, speaking aloud, as boys whistle to drive away\\nfear. \"There can be no doubt that I shall find my companions. There\\ncannot be two roads. It is certain that I was considerably ahead; all I\\nhave to do is to go back.\"\\n\\nHaving come to this determination I ascended the tunnel for at least\\nhalf an hour, unable to decide if I had ever seen certain landmarks\\nbefore. Every now and then I paused to discover if any loud appeal was\\nmade to me, well knowing that in that dense and intensified atmosphere I\\nshould hear it a long way off. But no. The most extraordinary silence\\nreigned in this immense gallery. Only the echoes of my own footsteps\\ncould be heard.\\n\\nAt last I stopped. I could scarcely realize the fact of my isolation. I\\nwas quite willing to think that I had made a mistake, but not that I was\\nlost. If I had made a mistake, I might find my way; if lost--I shuddered\\nto think of it.\\n\\n\"Come, come,\" said I to myself, \"since there is only one road, and they\\nmust come by it, we shall at last meet. All I have to do is still to go\\nupwards. Perhaps, however, not seeing me, and forgetting I was ahead,\\nthey may have gone back in search of me. Still, even in this case, if I\\nmake haste, I shall get up to them. There can be no doubt about the\\nmatter.\"\\n\\nBut as I spoke these last words aloud, it would have been quite clear to\\nany listener--had there been one--that I was by no means convinced of\\nthe fact. Moreover in order to associate together these simple ideas and\\nto reunite them under the form of reasoning, required some time. I could\\nnot all at once bring my brain to think.\\n\\nThen another dread doubt fell upon my soul. After all, was I ahead? Of\\ncourse I was. Hans was no doubt following behind preceded by my uncle. I\\nperfectly recollected his having stopped for a moment to strap his\\nbaggage on his shoulder. I now remembered this trifling detail. It was,\\nI believe, just at that very moment that I had determined to continue my\\nroute.\\n\\n\"Again,\" thought I, reasoning as calmly as was possible, \"there is\\nanother sure means of not losing my way, a thread to guide me through\\nthe labyrinthine subterraneous retreat--one which I had forgotten--my\\nfaithful river.\"\\n\\nThis course of reasoning roused my drooping spirits, and I resolved to\\nresume my journey without further delay. No time was to be lost.\\n\\nIt was at this moment that I had reason to bless the thoughtfulness of\\nmy uncle, when he refused to allow the eider hunter to close the\\norifices of the hot spring--that small fissure in the great mass of\\ngranite. This beneficent spring after having saved us from thirst during\\nso many days would now enable me to regain the right road.\\n\\nHaving come to this mental decision, I made up my mind, before I started\\nupwards, that ablution would certainly do me a great deal of good.\\n\\nI stopped to plunge my hands and forehead in the pleasant water of the\\nHansbach stream, blessing its presence as a certain consolation.\\n\\nConceive my horror and stupefaction!--I was treading a hard, dusty,\\nshingly road of granite. The stream on which I reckoned had wholly\\ndisappeared!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 24\\n\\nLOST!\\n\\n\\nNo words in any human language can depict my utter despair. I was\\nliterally buried alive; with no other expectation before me but to die\\nin all the slow horrible torture of hunger and thirst.\\n\\nMechanically I crawled about, feeling the dry and arid rock. Never to my\\nfancy had I ever felt anything so dry.\\n\\nBut, I frantically asked myself, how had I lost the course of the\\nflowing stream? There could be no doubt it had ceased to flow in the\\ngallery in which I now was. Now I began to understand the cause of the\\nstrange silence which prevailed when last I tried if any appeal from my\\ncompanions might perchance reach my ear.\\n\\nIt so happened that when I first took an imprudent step in the wrong\\ndirection, I did not perceive the absence of the all-important stream.\\n\\nIt was now quite evident that when we halted, another tunnel must have\\nreceived the waters of the little torrent, and that I had unconsciously\\nentered a different gallery. To what unknown depths had my companions\\ngone? Where was I?\\n\\nHow to get back! Clue or landmark there was absolutely none! My feet\\nleft no signs on the granite and shingle. My brain throbbed with agony\\nas I tried to discover the solution of this terrible problem. My\\nsituation, after all sophistry and reflection, had finally to be summed\\nup in three awful words--\\n\\n<i>Lost!</i> Lost!! LOST!!!\\n\\nLost at a depth which, to my finite understanding, appeared to be\\nimmeasurable.\\n\\nThese thirty leagues of the crust of the earth weighed upon my shoulders\\nlike the globe on the shoulders of Atlas. I felt myself crushed by the\\nawful weight. It was indeed a position to drive the sanest man to\\nmadness!\\n\\nI tried to bring my thoughts back to the things of the world so long\\nforgotten. It was with the greatest difficulty that I succeeded in doing\\nso. Hamburg, the house on the Konigstrasse, my dear cousin Gretchen--all\\nthat world which had before vanished like a shadow floated before my now\\nvivid imagination.\\n\\nThere they were before me, but how unreal. Under the influence of a\\nterrible hallucination I saw all the incidents of our journey pass\\nbefore me like the scenes of a panorama. The ship and its inmates,\\nIceland, M. Fridriksson, and the great summit of Mount Sneffels! I said\\nto myself that, if in my position I retained the most faint and shadowy\\noutline of a hope, it would be a sure sign of approaching delirium. It\\nwere better to give way wholly to despair!\\n\\nIn fact, did I but reason with calmness and philosophy, what human power\\nwas there in existence able to take me back to the surface of the earth,\\nand ready, too, to split asunder, to rend in twain those huge and mighty\\nvaults which stand above my head? Who could enable me to find my\\nroad--and regain my companions?\\n\\nInsensate folly and madness to entertain even a shadow of hope!\\n\\n\"Oh, Uncle!\" was my despairing cry.\\n\\nThis was the only word of reproach which came to my lips; for I\\nthoroughly understood how deeply and sorrowfully the worthy Professor\\nwould regret my loss, and how in his turn he would patiently seek for\\nme.\\n\\nWhen I at last began to resign myself to the fact that no further aid\\nwas to be expected from man, and knowing that I was utterly powerless to\\ndo anything for my own salvation, I kneeled with earnest fervor and\\nasked assistance from Heaven. The remembrance of my innocent childhood,\\nthe memory of my mother, known only in my infancy, came welling forth\\nfrom my heart. I had recourse to prayer. And little as I had a right to\\nbe remembered by Him whom I had forgotten in the hour of prosperity, and\\nwhom I so tardily invoked, I prayed earnestly and sincerely.\\n\\nThis renewal of my youthful faith brought about a much greater amount of\\ncalm, and I was enabled to concentrate all my strength and intelligence\\non the terrible realities of my unprecedented situation.\\n\\nI had about me that which I had at first wholly forgotten--three days\\'\\nprovisions. Moreover, my water bottle was quite full. Nevertheless, the\\none thing which it was impossible to do was to remain alone. Try to find\\nmy companions I must, at any price. But which course should I take?\\nShould I go upwards, or again descend? Doubtless it was right to retrace\\nmy steps in an upward direction.\\n\\nBy doing this with care and coolness, I must reach the point where I had\\nturned away from the rippling stream. I must find the fatal bifurcation\\nor fork. Once at this spot, once the river at my feet, I could, at all\\nevents, regain the awful crater of Mount Sneffels. Why had I not thought\\nof this before? This, at last, was a reasonable hope of safety. The most\\nimportant thing, then, to be done was to discover the bed of the\\nHansbach.\\n\\nAfter a slight meal and a draught of water, I rose like a giant\\nrefreshed. Leaning heavily on my pole, I began the ascent of the\\ngallery. The slope was very rapid and rather difficult. But I advanced\\nhopefully and carefully, like a man who at last is making his way out of\\na forest, and knows there is only one road to follow.\\n\\nDuring one whole hour nothing happened to check my progress. As I\\nadvanced, I tried to recollect the shape of the tunnel--to recall to my\\nmemory certain projections of rocks--to persuade myself that I had\\nfollowed certain winding routes before. But no one particular sign could\\nI bring to mind, and I was soon forced to allow that this gallery would\\nnever take me back to the point at which I had separated myself from my\\ncompanions. It was absolutely without issue--a mere blind alley in the\\nearth.\\n\\nThe moment at length came when, facing the solid rock, I knew my fate,\\nand fell inanimate on the arid floor!\\n\\nTo describe the horrible state of despair and fear into which I then\\nfell would now be vain and impossible. My last hope, the courage which\\nhad sustained me, drooped before the sight of this pitiless granite\\nrock!\\n\\nLost in a vast labyrinth, the sinuosities of which spread in every\\ndirection, without guide, clue or compass, I knew it was a vain and\\nuseless task to attempt flight. All that remained to me was to lie down\\nand die. To lie down and die the most cruel and horrible of deaths!\\n\\nIn my state of mind, the idea came into my head that one day perhaps,\\nwhen my fossil bones were found, their discovery so far below the level\\nof the earth might give rise to solemn and interesting scientific\\ndiscussions.\\n\\nI tried to cry aloud, but hoarse, hollow, and inarticulate sounds alone\\ncould make themselves heard through my parched lips. I literally panted\\nfor breath.\\n\\nIn the midst of all these horrible sources of anguish and despair, a new\\nhorror took possession of my soul. My lamp, by falling down, had got out\\nof order. I had no means of repairing it. Its light was already becoming\\npaler and paler, and soon would expire.\\n\\nWith a strange sense of resignation and despair, I watched the luminous\\ncurrent in the coil getting less and less. A procession of shadows moved\\nflashing along the granite wall. I scarcely dared to lower my eyelids,\\nfearing to lose the last spark of this fugitive light. Every instant it\\nseemed to me that it was about to vanish and to leave me forever--in\\nutter darkness!\\n\\nAt last, one final trembling flame remained in the lamp; I followed it\\nwith all my power of vision; I gasped for breath; I concentrated upon it\\nall the power of my soul, as upon the last scintillation of light I was\\never destined to see: and then I was to be lost forever in Cimmerian and\\ntenebrous shades.\\n\\nA wild and plaintive cry escaped my lips. On earth during the most\\nprofound and comparatively complete darkness, light never allows a\\ncomplete destruction and extinction of its power. Light is so diffuse,\\nso subtle, that it permeates everywhere, and whatever little may remain,\\nthe retina of the eye will succeed in finding it. In this place\\nnothing--the absolute obscurity made me blind in every sense.\\n\\nMy head was now wholly lost. I raised my arms, trying the effects of the\\nfeeling in getting against the cold stone wall. It was painful in the\\nextreme. Madness must have taken possession of me. I knew not what I\\ndid. I began to run, to fly, rushing at haphazard in this inextricable\\nlabyrinth, always going downwards, running wildly underneath the\\nterrestrial crust, like an inhabitant of the subterranean furnaces,\\nscreaming, roaring, howling, until bruised by the pointed rocks, falling\\nand picking myself up all covered with blood, seeking madly to drink the\\nblood which dripped from my torn features, mad because this blood only\\ntrickled over my face, and watching always for this horrid wall which\\never presented to me the fearful obstacle against which I could not dash\\nmy head.\\n\\nWhere was I going? It was impossible to say. I was perfectly ignorant of\\nthe matter.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed in this way. After a long time, having utterly\\nexhausted my strength, I fell a heavy inert mass along the side of the\\ntunnel, and lost consciousness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 25\\n\\nTHE WHISPERING GALLERY\\n\\n\\nWhen at last I came back to a sense of life and being, my face was wet,\\nbut wet, as I soon knew, with tears. How long this state of\\ninsensibility lasted, it is quite impossible for me now to say. I had no\\nmeans left to me of taking any account of time. Never since the creation\\nof the world had such a solitude as mine existed. I was completely\\nabandoned.\\n\\nAfter my fall I lost much blood. I felt myself flooded with the\\nlife-giving liquid. My first sensation was perhaps a natural one. Why\\nwas I not dead? Because I was alive, there was something left to do. I\\ntried to make up my mind to think no longer. As far as I was able, I\\ndrove away all ideas, and utterly overcome by pain and grief, I crouched\\nagainst the granite wall.\\n\\nI just commenced to feel the fainting coming on again, and the sensation\\nthat this was the last struggle before complete annihilation--when, on a\\nsudden, a violent uproar reached my ears. It had some resemblance to the\\nprolonged rumbling voice of thunder, and I clearly distinguished\\nsonorous voices, lost one after the other, in the distant depths of the\\ngulf.\\n\\nWhence came this noise? Naturally, it was to be supposed from new\\nphenomena which were taking place in the bosom of the solid mass of\\nMother Earth! The explosion of some gaseous vapors, or the fall of some\\nsolid, of the granitic or other rock.\\n\\nAgain I listened with deep attention. I was extremely anxious to hear if\\nthis strange and inexplicable sound was likely to be renewed! A whole\\nquarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation. Deep and solemn\\nsilence reigned in the tunnel. So still that I could hear the beatings\\nof my own heart! I waited, waited with a strange kind of hopefulness.\\n\\nSuddenly my ear, which leaned accidentally against the wall, appeared to\\ncatch, as it were, the faintest echo of a sound. I thought that I heard\\nvague, incoherent and distant voices. I quivered all over with\\nexcitement and hope!\\n\\n\"It must be hallucination,\" I cried. \"It cannot be! it is not true!\"\\n\\nBut no! By listening more attentively, I really did convince myself that\\nwhat I heard was truly the sound of human voices. To make any meaning\\nout of the sound, however, was beyond my power. I was too weak even to\\nhear distinctly. Still it was a positive fact that someone was speaking.\\nOf that I was quite certain.\\n\\nThere was a moment of fear. A dread fell upon my soul that it might be\\nmy own words brought back to me by a distant echo. Perhaps without\\nknowing it, I might have been crying aloud. I resolutely closed my lips,\\nand once more placed my ear to the huge granite wall.\\n\\nYes, for certain. It was in truth the sound of human voices.\\n\\nI now by the exercise of great determination dragged myself along the\\nsides of the cavern, until I reached a point where I could hear more\\ndistinctly. But though I could detect the sound, I could only make out\\nuncertain, strange, and incomprehensible words. They reached my ear as\\nif they had been spoken in a low tone--murmured, as it were, afar off.\\n\\nAt last, I made out the word forlorad repeated several times in a tone\\nbetokening great mental anguish and sorrow.\\n\\nWhat could this word mean, and who was speaking it? It must be either my\\nuncle or the guide Hans! If, therefore, I could hear them, they must\\nsurely be able to hear me.\\n\\n\"Help,\" I cried at the top of my voice; \"help, I am dying!\"\\n\\nI then listened with scarcely a breath; I panted for the slightest sound\\nin the darkness--a cry, a sigh, a question! But silence reigned supreme.\\nNo answer came! In this way some minutes passed. A whole flood of ideas\\nflashed through my mind. I began to fear that my voice, weakened by\\nsickness and suffering, could not reach my companions who were in search\\nof me.\\n\\n\"It must be they,\" I cried; \"who else could by any possibility be buried\\na hundred miles below the level of the earth?\" The mere supposition was\\npreposterous.\\n\\nI began, therefore, to listen again with the most breathless attention.\\nAs I moved my ears along the side of the place I was in, I found a\\nmathematical point as it were, where the voices appeared to attain their\\nmaximum of intensity. The word forlorad again distinctly reached my ear.\\nThen came again that rolling noise like thunder which had awakened me\\nout of torpor.\\n\\n\"I begin to understand,\" I said to myself after some little time devoted\\nto reflection; \"it is not through the solid mass that the sound reaches\\nmy ears. The walls of my cavernous retreat are of solid granite, and the\\nmost fearful explosion would not make uproar enough to penetrate them.\\nThe sound must come along the gallery itself. The place I was in must\\npossess some peculiar acoustic properties of its own.\"\\n\\nAgain I listened; and this time--yes, this time--I heard my name\\ndistinctly pronounced: cast as it were into space.\\n\\nIt was my uncle, the Professor, who was speaking. He was in conversation\\nwith the guide, and the word which had so often reached my ears,\\nforlorad, was a Danish expression.\\n\\nThen I understood it all. In order to make myself heard, I too must\\nspeak as it were along the side of the gallery, which would carry the\\nsound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point\\nto point.\\n\\nBut there was no time to lose. If my companions were only to remove a\\nfew feet from where they stood, the acoustic effect would be over, my\\nWhispering Gallery would be destroyed. I again therefore crawled towards\\nthe wall, and said as clearly and distinctly as I could:\\n\\n\"Uncle Hardwigg.\"\\n\\nI then awaited a reply.\\n\\nSound does not possess the property of traveling with such extreme\\nrapidity. Besides the density of the air at that depth from light and\\nmotion was very far from adding to the rapidity of circulation. Several\\nseconds elapsed, which to my excited imagination, appeared ages; and\\nthese words reached my eager ears, and moved my wildly beating heart:\\n\\n\"Harry, my boy, is that you?\"\\n\\nA short delay between question and answer.\\n\\n\"Yes--yes.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Where are you?\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Lost!\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"And your lamp?\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Out.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"But the guiding stream?\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Is lost!\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Keep your courage, Harry. We will do our best.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"One moment, my uncle,\" I cried; \"I have no longer strength to answer\\nyour questions. But--for heaven\\'s sake--do you--continue--to speak--to\\nme!\" Absolute silence, I felt, would be annihilation.\\n\\n\"Keep up your courage,\" said my uncle. \"As you are so weak, do not\\nspeak. We have been searching for you in all directions, both by going\\nupwards and downwards in the gallery. My dear boy, I had begun to give\\nover all hope--and you can never know what bitter tears of sorrow and\\nregret I have shed. At last, supposing you to be still on the road\\nbeside the Hansbach, we again descended, firing off guns as signals.\\nNow, however, that we have found you, and that our voices reach each\\nother, it may be a long time before we actually meet. We are conversing\\nby means of some extraordinary acoustic arrangement of the labyrinth.\\nBut do not despair, my dear boy. It is something gained even to hear\\neach other.\"\\n\\nWhile he was speaking, my brain was at work reflecting. A certain\\nundefined hope, vague and shapeless as yet, made my heart beat wildly.\\nIn the first place, it was absolutely necessary for me to know one\\nthing. I once more, therefore, leaned my head against the wall, which I\\nalmost touched with my lips, and again spoke.\\n\\n\"Uncle.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"My boy?\" was his answer after a few moments.\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"It is of the utmost consequence that we should know how far we are\\nasunder.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"That is not difficult.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"You have your chronometer at hand?\" I asked.\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Certainly.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Well, take it into your hand. Pronounce my name, noting exactly the\\nsecond at which you speak. I will reply as soon as I hear your\\nwords--and you will then note exactly the moment at which my reply\\nreaches you.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Very good; and the mean time between my question and your answer will\\nbe the time occupied by my voice in reaching you.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"That is exactly what I mean, Uncle,\" was my eager reply.\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Are you ready?\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Well, make ready, I am about to pronounce your name,\" said the\\nProfessor.\\n\\nI applied my ear close to the sides of the cavernous gallery, and as\\nsoon as the word \"Harry\" reached my ear, I turned round and, placing my\\nlips to the wall, repeated the sound.\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Forty seconds,\" said my uncle. \"There has elapsed forty seconds between\\nthe two words. The sound, therefore, takes twenty seconds to ascend.\\nNow, allowing a thousand and twenty feet for every second--we have\\ntwenty thousand four hundred feet--a league and a half and one-eighth.\"\\n\\nThese words fell on my soul like a kind of death knell.\\n\\n\"A league and a half,\" I muttered in a low and despairing voice.\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"It shall be got over, my boy,\" cried my uncle in a cheery tone; \"depend\\non us.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"But do you know whether to ascend or descend?\" I asked faintly enough.\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"We have to descend, and I will tell you why. You have reached a vast\\nopen space, a kind of bare crossroad, from which galleries diverge in\\nevery direction. That in which you are now lying must necessarily bring\\nyou to this point, for it appears that all these mighty fissures, these\\nfractures of the globe\\'s interior, radiate from the vast cavern which we\\nat this moment occupy. Rouse yourself, then, have courage and continue\\nyour route. Walk if you can, if not drag yourself along--slide, if\\nnothing else is possible. The slope must be rather rapid--and you will\\nfind strong arms to receive you at the end of your journey. Make a\\nstart, like a good fellow.\"\\n\\nThese words served to rouse some kind of courage in my sinking frame.\\n\\n\"Farewell for the present, good uncle, I am about to take my departure.\\nAs soon as I start, our voices will cease to commingle. Farewell, then,\\nuntil we meet again.\"\\n\\n..........\\n\\n\"Adieu, Harry--until we say Welcome.\" Such were the last words which\\nreached my anxious ears before I commenced my weary and almost hopeless\\njourney.\\n\\nThis wonderful and surprising conversation which took place through the\\nvast mass of the earth\\'s labyrinth, these words exchanged, the speakers\\nbeing about five miles apart--ended with hopeful and pleasant\\nexpressions. I breathed one more prayer to Heaven, I sent up words of\\nthanksgiving--believing in my inmost heart that He had led me to the\\nonly place where the voices of my friends could reach my ears.\\n\\nThis apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by\\nsimple natural laws; it arose from the conductibility of the rock. There\\nare many instances of this singular propagation of sound which are not\\nperceptible in its less mediate positions. In the interior gallery of\\nSt. Paul\\'s, and amid the curious caverns in Sicily, these phenomena are\\nobservable. The most marvelous of them all is known as the Ear of\\nDionysius.\\n\\nThese memories of the past, of my early reading and studies, came fresh\\nto my thoughts. Moreover, I began to reason that if my uncle and I could\\ncommunicate at so great a distance, no serious obstacle could exist\\nbetween us. All I had to do was to follow the direction whence the sound\\nhad reached me; and logically putting it, I must reach him if my\\nstrength did not fail.\\n\\nI accordingly rose to my feet. I soon found, however, that I could not\\nwalk; that I must drag myself along. The slope as I expected was very\\nrapid; but I allowed myself to slip down.\\n\\nSoon the rapidity of the descent began to assume frightful proportions;\\nand menaced a fearful fall. I clutched at the sides; I grasped at\\nprojections of rocks; I threw myself backwards. All in vain. My weakness\\nwas so great I could do nothing to save myself.\\n\\nSuddenly earth failed me.\\n\\nI was first launched into a dark and gloomy void. I then struck against\\nthe projecting asperities of a vertical gallery, a perfect well. My head\\nbounded against a pointed rock, and I lost all knowledge of existence.\\nAs far as I was concerned, death had claimed me for his own.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 26\\n\\nA RAPID RECOVERY\\n\\n\\nWhen I returned to the consciousness of existence, I found myself\\nsurrounded by a kind of semiobscurity, lying on some thick and soft\\ncoverlets. My uncle was watching--his eyes fixed intently on my\\ncountenance, a grave expression on his face, a tear in his eye. At the\\nfirst sigh which struggled from my bosom, he took hold of my hand. When\\nhe saw my eyes open and fix themselves upon his, he uttered a loud cry\\nof joy. \"He lives! he lives!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my good uncle,\" I whispered.\\n\\n\"My dear boy,\" continued the grim Professor, clasping me to his heart,\\n\"you are saved!\"\\n\\nI was deeply and unaffectedly touched by the tone in which these words\\nwere uttered, and even more by the kindly care which accompanied them.\\nThe Professor, however, was one of those men who must be severely tried\\nin order to induce any display of affection or gentle emotion. At this\\nmoment our friend Hans, the guide, joined us. He saw my hand in that of\\nmy uncle, and I venture to say that, taciturn as he was, his eyes beamed\\nwith lively satisfaction.\\n\\n\"God dag,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Good day, Hans, good day,\" I replied, in as hearty a tone as I could\\nassume, \"and now, Uncle, that we are together, tell me where we are. I\\nhave lost all idea of our position, as of everything else.\"\\n\\n\"Tomorrow, Harry, tomorrow,\" he replied. \"Today you are far too weak.\\nYour head is surrounded with bandages and poultices that must not be\\ntouched. Sleep, my boy, sleep, and tomorrow you will know all that you\\nrequire.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" I cried, \"let me know what o\\'clock it is--what day it is?\"\\n\\n\"It is now eleven o\\'clock at night, and this is once more Sunday. It is\\nnow the ninth of the month of August. And I distinctly prohibit you from\\nasking any more questions until the tenth of the same.\"\\n\\nI was, if the truth were told, very weak indeed, and my eyes soon closed\\ninvoluntarily. I did require a good night\\'s rest, and I went off\\nreflecting at the last moment that my perilous adventure in the interior\\nof the earth, in total darkness, had lasted four days!\\n\\nOn the morning of the next day, at my awakening, I began to look around\\nme. My sleeping place, made of all our traveling bedding, was in a\\ncharming grotto, adorned with magnificent stalagmites, glittering in all\\nthe colors of the rainbow, the floor of soft and silvery sand.\\n\\nA dim obscurity prevailed. No torch, no lamp was lighted, and yet\\ncertain unexplained beams of light penetrated from without, and made\\ntheir way through the opening of the beautiful grotto.\\n\\nI, moreover, heard a vague and indefinite murmur, like the ebb and flow\\nof waves upon a strand, and sometimes I verily believed I could hear the\\nsighing of the wind.\\n\\nI began to believe that, instead of being awake, I must be dreaming.\\nSurely my brain had not been affected by my fall, and all that occurred\\nduring the last twenty-four hours was not the frenzied visions of\\nmadness? And yet after some reflection, a trial of my faculties, I came\\nto the conclusion that I could not be mistaken. Eyes and ears could not\\nsurely both deceive me.\\n\\n\"It is a ray of the blessed daylight,\" I said to myself, \"which has\\npenetrated through some mighty fissure in the rocks. But what is the\\nmeaning of this murmur of waves, this unmistakable moaning of the\\nsalt-sea billows? I can hear, too, plainly enough, the whistling of the\\nwind. But can I be altogether mistaken? If my uncle, during my illness,\\nhas but carried me back to the surface of the earth! Has he, on my\\naccount, given up his wondrous expedition, or in some strange manner has\\nit come to an end?\"\\n\\nI was puzzling my brain over these and other questions, when the\\nProfessor joined me.\\n\\n\"Good day, Harry,\" he cried in a joyous tone. \"I fancy you are quite\\nwell.\"\\n\\n\"I am very much better,\" I replied, actually sitting up in my bed.\\n\\n\"I knew that would be the end of it, as you slept both soundly and\\ntranquilly. Hans and I have each taken turn to watch, and every hour we\\nhave seen visible signs of amelioration.\"\\n\\n\"You must be right, Uncle,\" was my reply, \"for I feel as if I could do\\njustice to any meal you could put before me.\"\\n\\n\"You shall eat, my boy, you shall eat. The fever has left you. Our\\nexcellent friend Hans has rubbed your wounds and bruises with I know not\\nwhat ointment, of which the Icelanders alone possess the secret. And\\nthey have healed your bruises in the most marvelous manner. Ah, he\\'s a\\nwise fellow is Master Hans.\"\\n\\nWhile he was speaking, my uncle was placing before me several articles\\nof food, which, despite his earnest injunctions, I readily devoured. As\\nsoon as the first rage of hunger was appeased, I overwhelmed him with\\nquestions, to which he now no longer hesitated to give answers.\\n\\nI then learned, for the first time, that my providential fall had\\nbrought me to the bottom of an almost perpendicular gallery. As I came\\ndown, amidst a perfect shower of stones, the least of which falling on\\nme would have crushed me to death, they came to the conclusion that I\\nhad carried with me an entire dislocated rock. Riding as it were on this\\nterrible chariot, I was cast headlong into my uncle\\'s arms. And into\\nthem I fell, insensible and covered with blood.\\n\\n\"It is indeed a miracle,\" was the Professor\\'s final remark, \"that you\\nwere not killed a thousand times over. But let us take care never to\\nseparate; for surely we should risk never meeting again.\"\\n\\n\"Let us take care never again to separate.\"\\n\\nThese words fell with a sort of chill upon my heart. The journey, then,\\nwas not over. I looked at my uncle with surprise and astonishment. My\\nuncle, after an instant\\'s examination of my countenance, said: \"What is\\nthe matter, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"I want to ask you a very serious question. You say that I am all right\\nin health?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly you are.\"\\n\\n\"And all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertion?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Most undoubtedly.\"\\n\\n\"But what about my head?\" was my next anxious question.\\n\\n\"Well, your head, except that you have one or two contusions, is exactly\\nwhere it ought to be--on your shoulders,\" said my uncle, laughing.\\n\\n\"Well, my own opinion is that my head is not exactly right. In fact, I\\nbelieve myself slightly delirious.\"\\n\\n\"What makes you think so?\"\\n\\n\"I will explain why I fancy I have lost my senses,\" I cried. \"Have we\\nnot returned to the surface of Mother Earth?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not.\"\\n\\n\"Then truly I must be mad, for do I not see the light of day? do I not\\nhear the whistling of the wind? and can I not distinguish the wash of a\\ngreat sea?\"\\n\\n\"And that is all that makes you uneasy?\" said my uncle, with a smile.\\n\\n\"Can you explain?\"\\n\\n\"I will not make any attempt to explain; for the whole matter is utterly\\ninexplicable. But you shall see and judge for yourself. You will then\\nfind that geological science is as yet in its infancy--and that we are\\ndoomed to enlighten the world.\"\\n\\n\"Let us advance, then,\" I cried eagerly, no longer able to restrain my\\ncuriosity.\\n\\n\"Wait a moment, my dear Harry,\" he responded; \"you must take precautions\\nafter your illness before going into the open air.\"\\n\\n\"The open air?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my boy. I have to warn you that the wind is rather violent--and I\\nhave no wish for you to expose yourself without necessary precautions.\"\\n\\n\"But I beg to assure you that I am perfectly recovered from my illness.\"\\n\\n\"Have just a little patience, my boy. A relapse would be inconvenient to\\nall parties. We have no time to lose--as our approaching sea voyage may\\nbe of long duration.\"\\n\\n\"Sea voyage?\" I cried, more bewildered than ever.\\n\\n\"Yes. You must take another day\\'s rest, and we shall be ready to go on\\nboard by tomorrow,\" replied my uncle, with a peculiar smile.\\n\\n\"Go on board!\" The words utterly astonished me.\\n\\nGo on board--what and how? Had we come upon a river, a lake, had we\\ndiscovered some inland sea? Was a vessel lying at anchor in some part of\\nthe interior of the earth?\\n\\nMy curiosity was worked up to the very highest pitch. My uncle made vain\\nattempts to restrain me. When at last, however, he discovered that my\\nfeverish impatience would do more harm than good--and that the\\nsatisfaction of my wishes could alone restore me to a calm state of\\nmind--he gave way.\\n\\nI dressed myself rapidly--and then taking the precaution to please my\\nuncle, of wrapping myself in one of the coverlets, I rushed out of the\\ngrotto.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 27\\n\\nTHE CENTRAL SEA\\n\\n\\nAt first I saw absolutely nothing. My eyes, wholly unused to the\\neffulgence of light, could not bear the sudden brightness; and I was\\ncompelled to close them. When I was able to reopen them, I stood still,\\nfar more stupefied than astonished. Not all the wildest effects of\\nimagination could have conjured up such a scene! \"The sea--the sea,\" I\\ncried.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied my uncle, in a tone of pardonable pride; \"the Central\\nSea. No future navigator will deny the fact of my having discovered it;\\nand hence of acquiring a right of giving it a name.\"\\n\\nIt was quite true. A vast, limitless expanse of water, the end of a lake\\nif not of an ocean, spread before us, until it was lost in the distance.\\nThe shore, which was very much indented, consisted of a beautiful soft\\ngolden sand, mixed with small shells, the long-deserted home of some of\\nthe creatures of a past age. The waves broke incessantly--and with a\\npeculiarly sonorous murmur, to be found in underground localities. A\\nslight frothy flake arose as the wind blew along the pellucid waters;\\nand many a dash of spray was blown into my face. The mighty\\nsuperstructure of rock which rose above to an inconceivable height left\\nonly a narrow opening--but where we stood, there was a large margin of\\nstrand. On all sides were capes and promontories and enormous cliffs,\\npartially worn by the eternal breaking of the waves, through countless\\nages! And as I gazed from side to side, the mighty rocks faded away like\\na fleecy film of cloud.\\n\\nIt was in reality an ocean, with all the usual characteristics of an\\ninland sea, only horribly wild--so rigid, cold and savage.\\n\\nOne thing startled and puzzled me greatly. How was it that I was able to\\nlook upon that vast sheet of water instead of being plunged in utter\\ndarkness? The vast landscape before me was lit up like day. But there\\nwas wanting the dazzling brilliancy, the splendid irradiation of the\\nsun; the pale cold illumination of the moon; the brightness of the\\nstars. The illuminating power in this subterranean region, from its\\ntrembling and Rickering character, its clear dry whiteness, the very\\nslight elevation of its temperature, its great superiority to that of\\nthe moon, was evidently electric; something in the nature of the aurora\\nborealis, only that its phenomena were constant, and able to light up\\nthe whole of the ocean cavern.\\n\\nThe tremendous vault above our heads, the sky, so to speak, appeared to\\nbe composed of a conglomeration of nebulous vapors, in constant motion.\\nI should originally have supposed that, under such an atmospheric\\npressure as must exist in that place, the evaporation of water could not\\nreally take place, and yet from the action of some physical law, which\\nescaped my memory, there were heavy and dense clouds rolling along that\\nmighty vault, partially concealing the roof. Electric currents produced\\nastonishing play of light and shade in the distance, especially around\\nthe heavier clouds. Deep shadows were cast beneath, and then suddenly,\\nbetween two clouds, there would come a ray of unusual beauty, and\\nremarkable intensity. And yet it was not like the sun, for it gave no\\nheat.\\n\\nThe effect was sad and excruciatingly melancholy. Instead of a noble\\nfirmament of blue, studded with stars, there was above me a heavy roof\\nof granite, which seemed to crush me.\\n\\nGazing around, I began to think of the theory of the English captain who\\ncompared the earth to a vast hollow sphere in the interior of which the\\nair is retained in a luminous state by means of atmospheric pressure,\\nwhile two stars, Pluto and Proserpine, circled there in their mysterious\\norbits. After all, suppose the old fellow was right!\\n\\nIn truth, we were imprisoned--bound as it were, in a vast excavation.\\nIts width it was impossible to make out; the shore, on either hand,\\nwidening rapidly until lost to sight; while its length was equally\\nuncertain. A haze on the distant horizon bounded our view. As to its\\nheight, we could see that it must be many miles to the roof. Looking\\nupward, it was impossible to discover where the stupendous roof began.\\nThe lowest of the clouds must have been floating at an elevation of two\\nthousand yards, a height greater than that of terrestrial vapors, which\\ncircumstance was doubtless owing to the extreme density of the air.\\n\\nI use the word \"cavern\" in order to give an idea of the place. I cannot\\ndescribe its awful grandeur; human language fails to convey an idea of\\nits savage sublimity. Whether this singular vacuum had or had not been\\ncaused by the sudden cooling of the earth when in a state of fusion, I\\ncould not say. I had read of most wonderful and gigantic caverns--but,\\nnone in any way like this.\\n\\nThe great grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by the learned\\nHumboldt; the vast and partially explored Mammoth Cave in Kentucky--what\\nwere these holes in the earth to that in which I stood in speechless\\nadmiration! with its vapory clouds, its electric light, and the mighty\\nocean slumbering in its bosom! Imagination, not description, can alone\\ngive an idea of the splendor and vastness of the cave.\\n\\nI gazed at these marvels in profound silence. Words were utterly wanting\\nto indicate the sensations of wonder I experienced. I seemed, as I stood\\nupon that mysterious shore, as if I were some wandering inhabitant of a\\ndistant planet, present for the first time at the spectacle of some\\nterrestrial phenomena belonging to another existence. To give body and\\nexistence to such new sensations would have required the coinage of new\\nwords--and here my feeble brain found itself wholly at fault. I looked\\non, I thought, I reflected, I admired, in a state of stupefaction not\\naltogether unmingled with fear!\\n\\nThe unexpected spectacle restored some color to my pallid cheeks. I\\nseemed to be actually getting better under the influence of this\\nnovelty. Moreover, the vivacity of the dense atmosphere reanimated my\\nbody by inflating my lungs with unaccustomed oxygen.\\n\\nIt will be readily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty-seven\\ndays, in a dark and miserable tunnel it was with infinite delight that I\\nbreathed this saline air. It was like the genial, reviving influence of\\nthe salt sea waves.\\n\\nMy uncle had already got over the first surprise.\\n\\nWith the Latin poet Horace his idea was that--\\n\\n     Not to admire is all the art I know,\\n\\n     To make man happy and to keep him so.\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" he said, after giving me time thoroughly to appreciate the\\nmarvels of this underground sea, \"do you feel strong enough to walk up\\nand down?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" was my ready answer, \"nothing would give me greater\\npleasure.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, my boy,\" he said, \"lean on my arm, and we will stroll along\\nthe beach.\"\\n\\nI accepted his offer eagerly, and we began to walk along the shores of\\nthis extraordinary lake. To our left were abrupt rocks, piled one upon\\nthe other--a stupendous titanic pile; down their sides leaped\\ninnumerable cascades, which at last, becoming limpid and murmuring\\nstreams, were lost in the waters of the lake. Light vapors, which rose\\nhere and there, and floated in fleecy clouds from rock to rock,\\nindicated hot springs, which also poured their superfluity into the vast\\nreservoir at our feet.\\n\\nAmong them I recognized our old and faithful stream, the Hansbach,\\nwhich, lost in that wild basin, seemed as if it had been flowing since\\nthe creation of the world.\\n\\n\"We shall miss our excellent friend,\" I remarked, with a deep sigh.\\n\\n\"Bah!\" said my uncle testily, \"what matters it? That or another, it is\\nall the same.\"\\n\\nI thought the remark ungrateful, and felt almost inclined to say so; but\\nI forbore.\\n\\nAt this moment my attention was attracted by an unexpected spectacle.\\nAfter we had gone about five hundred yards, we suddenly turned a steep\\npromontory, and found ourselves close to a lofty forest! It consisted of\\nstraight trunks with tufted tops, in shape like parasols. The air seemed\\nto have no effect upon these trees--which in spite of a tolerable breeze\\nremained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified.\\n\\nI hastened forward. I could find no name for these singular formations.\\nDid they not belong to the two thousand and more known trees--or were we\\nto make the discovery of a new growth? By no means. When we at last\\nreached the forest, and stood beneath the trees, my surprise gave way to\\nadmiration.\\n\\nIn truth, I was simply in the presence of a very ordinary product of the\\nearth, of singular and gigantic proportions. My uncle unhesitatingly\\ncalled them by their real names.\\n\\n\"It is only,\" he said, in his coolest manner, \"a forest of mushrooms.\"\\n\\nOn close examination I found that he was not mistaken. Judge of the\\ndevelopment attained by this product of damp hot soils. I had heard that\\nthe Lycoperdon giganteum reaches nine feet in circumference, but here\\nwere white mushrooms, nearly forty feet high, and with tops of equal\\ndimensions. They grew in countless thousands--the light could not make\\nits way through their massive substance, and beneath them reigned a\\ngloomy and mystic darkness.\\n\\nStill I wished to go forward. The cold in the shades of this singular\\nforest was intense. For nearly an hour we wandered about in this visible\\ndarkness. At length I left the spot, and once more returned to the\\nshores of the lake, to light and comparative warmth.\\n\\nBut the amazing vegetation of subterraneous land was not confined to\\ngigantic mushrooms. New wonders awaited us at every step. We had not\\ngone many hundred yards, when we came upon a mighty group of other trees\\nwith discolored leaves--the common humble trees of Mother Earth, of an\\nexorbitant and phenomenal size: lycopods a hundred feet high; flowering\\nferns as tall as pines; gigantic grasses!\\n\\n\"Astonishing, magnificent, splendid!\" cried my uncle; \"here we have\\nbefore us the whole flora of the second period of the world, that of\\ntransition. Behold the humble plants of our gardens, which in the first\\nages of the world were mighty trees. Look around you, my dear Harry. No\\nbotanist ever before gazed on such a sight!\"\\n\\nMy uncle\\'s enthusiasm, always a little more than was required, was now\\nexcusable.\\n\\n\"You are right, Uncle,\" I remarked. \"Providence appears to have designed\\nthe preservation in this vast and mysterious hothouse of antediluvian\\nplants, to prove the sagacity of learned men in figuring them so\\nmarvelously on paper.\"\\n\\n\"Well said, my boy--very well said; it is indeed a mighty hothouse. But\\nyou would also be within the bounds of reason and common sense, if you\\nadded that it is also a vast menagerie.\"\\n\\nI looked rather anxiously around. If the animals were as exaggerated as\\nthe plants, the matter would certainly be serious.\\n\\n\"A menagerie?\"\\n\\n\"Doubtless. Look at the dust we are treading under foot--behold the\\nbones with which the whole soil of the seashore is covered--\"\\n\\n\"Bones,\" I replied, \"yes, certainly, the bones of antediluvian animals.\"\\n\\nI stooped down as I spoke, and picked up one or two singular remains,\\nrelics of a bygone age. It was easy to give a name to these gigantic\\nbones, in some instances as big as trunks of trees.\\n\\n\"Here is, clearly, the lower jawbone of a mastodon,\" I cried, almost as\\nwarmly and enthusiastically as my uncle; \"here are the molars of the\\nDinotherium; here is a leg bone which belonged to the Megatherium. You\\nare right, Uncle, it is indeed a menagerie; for the mighty animals to\\nwhich these bones once belonged, have lived and died on the shores of\\nthis subterranean sea, under the shadow of these plants. Look, yonder\\nare whole skeletons--and yet--\"\\n\\n\"And yet, nephew?\" said my uncle, noticing that I suddenly came to a\\nfull stop.\\n\\n\"I do not understand the presence of such beasts in granite caverns,\\nhowever vast and prodigious,\" was my reply.\\n\\n\"Why not?\" said my uncle, with very much of his old professional\\nimpatience.\\n\\n\"Because it is well known that animal life only existed on earth during\\nthe secondary period, when the sedimentary soil was formed by the\\nalluviums, and thus replaced the hot and burning rocks of the primitive\\nage.\"\\n\\n\"I have listened to you earnestly and with patience, Harry, and I have a\\nsimple and clear answer to your objections: and that is, that this\\nitself is a sedimentary soil.\"\\n\\n\"How can that be at such enormous depth from the surface of the earth?\"\\n\\n\"The fact can be explained both simply and geologically. At a certain\\nperiod, the earth consisted only of an elastic crust, liable to\\nalternative upward and downward movements in virtue of the law of\\nattraction. It is very probable that many a landslip took place in those\\ndays, and that large portions of sedimentary soil were cast into huge\\nand mighty chasms.\"\\n\\n\"Quite possible,\" I dryly remarked. \"But, Uncle, if these antediluvian\\nanimals formerly lived in these subterranean regions, what more likely\\nthan that one of these monsters may at this moment be concealed behind\\none of yonder mighty rocks.\"\\n\\nAs I spoke, I looked keenly around, examining with care every point of\\nthe horizon; but nothing alive appeared to exist on these deserted\\nshores.\\n\\nI now felt rather fatigued, and told my uncle so. The walk and\\nexcitement were too much for me in my weak state. I therefore seated\\nmyself at the end of a promontory, at the foot of which the waves broke\\nin incessant rolls. I looked round a bay formed by projections of vast\\ngranitic rocks. At the extreme end was a little port protected by huge\\npyramids of stones. A brig and three or four schooners might have lain\\nthere with perfect ease. So natural did it seem, that every minute my\\nimagination induced me to expect a vessel coming out under all sail and\\nmaking for the open sea under the influence of a warm southerly breeze.\\n\\nBut the fantastic illusion never lasted more than a minute. We were the\\nonly living creatures in this subterranean world!\\n\\nDuring certain periods there was an utter cessation of wind, when a\\nsilence deeper, more terrible than the silence of the desert fell upon\\nthese solitary and arid rocks--and seemed to hang like a leaden weight\\nupon the waters of this singular ocean. I sought, amid the awful\\nstillness, to penetrate through the distant fog, to tear down the veil\\nwhich concealed the mysterious distance. What unspoken words were\\nmurmured by my trembling lips--what questions did I wish to ask and did\\nnot! Where did this sea end--to what did it lead? Should we ever be able\\nto examine its distant shores?\\n\\nBut my uncle had no doubts about the matter. He was convinced that our\\nenterprise would in the end be successful. For my part, I was in a state\\nof painful indecision--I desired to embark on the journey and to\\nsucceed, and still I feared the result.\\n\\nAfter we had passed an hour or more in silent contemplation of the\\nwondrous spectacle, we rose and went down towards the bank on our way to\\nthe grotto, which I was not sorry to gain. After a slight repast, I\\nsought refuge in slumber, and at length, after many and tedious\\nstruggles, sleep came over my weary eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 28\\n\\nLAUNCHING THE RAFT\\n\\n\\nOn the morning of the next day, to my great surprise, I awoke completely\\nrestored. I thought a bath would be delightful after my long illness and\\nsufferings. So, soon after rising, I went and plunged into the waters of\\nthis new Mediterranean. The bath was cool, fresh and invigorating.\\n\\nI came back to breakfast with an excellent appetite. Hans, our worthy\\nguide, thoroughly understood how to cook such eatables as we were able\\nto provide; he had both fire and water at discretion, so that he was\\nenabled slightly to vary the weary monotony of our ordinary repast.\\n\\nOur morning meal was like a capital English breakfast, with coffee by\\nway of a windup. And never had this delicious beverage been so welcome\\nand refreshing.\\n\\nMy uncle had sufficient regard for my state of health not to interrupt\\nme in the enjoyment of the meal, but he was evidently delighted when I\\nhad finished.\\n\\n\"Now then,\" said he, \"come with me. It is the height of the tide, and I\\nam anxious to study its curious phenomena.\"\\n\\n\"What!\"\\' I cried, rising in astonishment, \"did you say the tide, Uncle?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly I did.\"\\n\\n\"You do not mean to say,\" I replied, in a tone of respectful doubt,\\n\"that the influence of the sun and moon is felt here below.\"\\n\\n\"And pray why not? Are not all bodies influenced by the law of universal\\nattraction? Why should this vast underground sea be exempt from the\\ngeneral law, the rule of the universe? Besides, there is nothing like\\nthat which is proved and demonstrated. Despite the great atmospheric\\npressure down here, you will notice that this inland sea rises and falls\\nwith as much regularity as the Atlantic itself.\"\\n\\nAs my uncle spoke, we reached the sandy shore, and saw and heard the\\nwaves breaking monotonously on the beach. They were evidently rising.\\n\\n\"This is truly the flood,\" I cried, looking at the water at my feet.\\n\\n\"Yes, my excellent nephew,\" replied my uncle, rubbing his hands with the\\ngusto of a philosopher, \"and you see by these several streaks of foam\\nthat the tide rises at least ten or twelve feet.\"\\n\\n\"It is indeed marvelous.\"\\n\\n\"By no means,\" he responded; \"on the contrary, it is quite natural.\"\\n\\n\"It may appear so in your eyes, my dear uncle,\" was my reply, \"but all\\nthe phenomena of the place appear to me to partake of the marvelous. It\\nis almost impossible to believe that which I see. Who in his wildest\\ndreams could have imagined that, beneath the crust of our earth, there\\ncould exist a real ocean, with ebbing and flowing tides, with its\\nchanges of winds, and even its storms! I for one should have laughed the\\nsuggestion to scorn.\"\\n\\n\"But, Harry, my boy, why not?\" inquired my uncle, with a pitying smile;\\n\"is there any physical reason in opposition to it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, if we give up the great theory of the central heat of the earth,\\nI certainly can offer no reasons why anything should be looked upon as\\nimpossible.\"\\n\\n\"Then you will own,\" he added, \"that the system of Sir Humphry Davy is\\nwholly justified by what we have seen?\"\\n\\n\"I allow that it is--and that point once granted, I certainly can see no\\nreason for doubting the existence of seas and other wonders, even\\ncountries, in the interior of the globe.\"\\n\\n\"That is so--but of course these varied countries are uninhabited?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I grant that it is more likely than not: still, I do not see why\\nthis sea should not have given shelter to some species of unknown fish.\"\\n\\n\"Hitherto we have not discovered any, and the probabilities are rather\\nagainst our ever doing so,\" observed the Professor.\\n\\nI was losing my skepticism in the presence of these wonders.\\n\\n\"Well, I am determined to solve the question. It is my intention to try\\nmy luck with my fishing line and hook.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; make the experiment,\" said my uncle, pleased with my\\nenthusiasm. \"While we are about it, it will certainly be only proper to\\ndiscover all the secrets of this extraordinary region.\"\\n\\n\"But, after all, where are we now?\" I asked; \"all this time I have quite\\nforgotten to ask you a question, which, doubtless, your philosophical\\ninstruments have long since answered.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" replied the Professor, \"examining the situation from only one\\npoint of view, we are now distant three hundred and fifty leagues from\\nIceland.\"\\n\\n\"So much?\" was my exclamation.\\n\\n\"I have gone over the matter several times, and am sure not to have made\\na mistake of five hundred yards,\" replied my uncle positively.\\n\\n\"And as to the direction--are we still going to the southeast?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, with a western declination[2] of nineteen degrees, forty-two\\nminutes, just as it is above. As for the inclination[3] I have\\ndiscovered a very curious fact.\"\\n\\n[2] The declination is the variation of the needle from the true\\nmeridian of a place.\\n\\n[3] Inclination is the dip of the magnetic needle with a tendency to\\nincline towards the earth.\\n\\n\"What may that be, Uncle? Your information interests me.\"\\n\\n\"Why, that the needle instead of dipping towards the pole as it does on\\nearth, in the northern hemisphere, has an upward tendency.\"\\n\\n\"This proves,\" I cried, \"that the great point of magnetic attraction\\nlies somewhere between the surface of the earth and the spot we have\\nsucceeded in reaching.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly, my observant nephew,\" exclaimed my uncle, elated and\\ndelighted, \"and it is quite probable that if we succeed in getting\\ntoward the polar regions--somewhere near the seventy-third degree of\\nlatitude, where Sir James Ross discovered the magnetic pole, we shall\\nbehold the needle point directly upward. We have therefore discovered by\\nanalogy, that this great centre of attraction is not situated at a very\\ngreat depth.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, rather surprised, \"this discovery will astonish\\nexperimental philosophers. It was never suspected.\"\\n\\n\"Science, great, mighty and in the end unerring,\" replied my uncle\\ndogmatically, \"science has fallen into many errors--errors which have\\nbeen fortunate and useful rather than otherwise, for they have been the\\nsteppingstones to truth.\"\\n\\nAfter some further discussion, I turned to another matter.\\n\\n\"Have you any idea of the depth we have reached?\"\\n\\n\"We are now,\" continued the Professor, \"exactly thirty-five\\nleagues--above a hundred miles--down into the interior of the earth.\"\\n\\n\"So,\" said I, after measuring the distance on the map, \"we are now\\nbeneath the Scottish Highlands, and have over our heads the lofty\\nGrampian Hills.\"\\n\\n\"You are quite right,\" said the Professor, laughing; \"it sounds very\\nalarming, the weight being heavy--but the vault which supports this vast\\nmass of earth and rock is solid and safe; the mighty Architect of the\\nUniverse has constructed it of solid materials. Man, even in his highest\\nflights of vivid and poetic imagination, never thought of such things!\\nWhat are the finest arches of our bridges, what the vaulted roofs of our\\ncathedrals, to that mighty dome above us, and beneath which floats an\\nocean with its storms and calms and tides!\"\\n\\n\"I admire it all as much as you can, Uncle, and have no fear that our\\ngranite sky will fall upon our heads. But now that we have discussed\\nmatters of science and discovery, what are your future intentions? Are\\nyou not thinking of getting back to the surface of our beautiful earth?\"\\n\\nThis was said more as a feeler than with any hope of success.\\n\\n\"Go back, nephew,\" cried my uncle in a tone of alarm, \"you are not\\nsurely thinking of anything so absurd or cowardly. No, my intention is\\nto advance and continue our journey. We have as yet been singularly\\nfortunate, and henceforth I hope we shall be more so.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" said I, \"how are we to cross yonder liquid plain?\"\\n\\n\"It is not my intention to leap into it head foremost, or even to swim\\nacross it, like Leander over the Hellespont. But as oceans are, after\\nall, only great lakes, inasmuch as they are surrounded by land, so does\\nit stand to reason, that this central sea is circumscribed by granite\\nsurroundings.\"\\n\\n\"Doubtless,\" was my natural reply.\\n\\n\"Well, then, do you not think that when once we reach the other end, we\\nshall find some means of continuing our journey?\"\\n\\n\"Probably, but what extent do you allow to this internal ocean?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I should fancy it to extend about forty or fifty leagues--more or\\nless.\"\\n\\n\"But even supposing this approximation to be a correct one--what then?\"\\nI asked.\\n\\n\"My dear boy, we have no time for further discussion. We shall embark\\ntomorrow.\"\\n\\nI looked around with surprise and incredulity. I could see nothing in\\nthe shape of boat or vessel.\\n\\n\"What!\" I cried, \"we are about to launch out upon an unknown sea; and\\nwhere, if I may ask, is the vessel to carry us?\"\\n\\n\"Well, my dear boy, it will not be exactly what you would call a vessel.\\nFor the present we must be content with a good and solid raft.\"\\n\\n\"A raft,\" I cried, incredulously, \"but down here a raft is as impossible\\nof construction as a vessel--and I am at a loss to imagine--\"\\n\\n\"My good Harry--if you were to listen instead of talking so much, you\\nwould hear,\" said my uncle, waxing a little impatient.\\n\\n\"I should hear?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--certain knocks with the hammer, which Hans is now employing to\\nmake the raft. He has been at work for many hours.\"\\n\\n\"Making a raft?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But where has he found trees suitable for such a construction?\"\\n\\n\"He found the trees all ready to his hand. Come, and you shall see our\\nexcellent guide at work.\"\\n\\nMore and more amazed at what I heard and saw, I followed my uncle like\\none in a dream.\\n\\nAfter a walk of about a quarter of an hour, I saw Hans at work on the\\nother side of the promontory which formed our natural port. A few\\nminutes more and I was beside him. To my great surprise, on the sandy\\nshore lay a half-finished raft. It was made from beams of a very\\npeculiar wood, and a great number of limbs, joints, boughs, and pieces\\nlay about, sufficient to have constructed a fleet of ships and boats.\\n\\nI turned to my uncle, silent with astonishment and awe.\\n\\n\"Where did all this wood come from?\" I cried; \"what wood is it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, there is pinewood, fir, and the palms of the northern regions,\\nmineralized by the action of the sea,\" he replied, sententiously.\\n\\n\"Can it be possible?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the learned Professor, \"what you see is called fossil wood.\"\\n\\n\"But then,\" cried I, after reflecting for a moment, \"like the lignites,\\nit must be as hard and as heavy as iron, and therefore will certainly\\nnot float.\"\\n\\n\"Sometimes that is the case. Many of these woods have become true\\nanthracites, but others again, like those you see before you, have only\\nundergone one phase of fossil transformation. But there is no proof like\\ndemonstration,\" added my uncle, picking one or two of these precious\\nwaifs and casting them into the sea.\\n\\nThe piece of wood, after having disappeared for a moment, came to the\\nsurface, and floated about with the oscillation produced by wind and\\ntide.\\n\\n\"Are you convinced?\" said my uncle, with a self-satisfied smile.\\n\\n\"I am convinced,\" I cried, \"that what I see is incredible.\"\\n\\nThe fact was that my journey into the interior of the earth was rapidly\\nchanging all preconceived notions, and day by day preparing me for the\\nmarvelous.\\n\\nI should not have been surprised to have seen a fleet of native canoes\\nafloat upon that silent sea.\\n\\nThe very next evening, thanks to the industry and ability of Hans, the\\nraft was finished. It was about ten feet long and five feet wide. The\\nbeams bound together with stout ropes, were solid and firm, and once\\nlaunched by our united efforts, the improvised vessel floated tranquilly\\nupon the waters of what the Professor had well named the Central Sea.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 29\\n\\nON THE WATERS--A RAFT VOYAGE\\n\\n\\nOn the thirteenth of August we were up betimes. There was no time to be\\nlost. We now had to inaugurate a new kind of locomotion, which would\\nhave the advantage of being rapid and not fatiguing.\\n\\nA mast, made of two pieces of wood fastened together, to give additional\\nstrength, a yard made from another one, the sail a linen sheet from our\\nbed. We were fortunately in no want of cordage, and the whole on trial\\nappeared solid and seaworthy.\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock in the morning, when the eager and enthusiastic Professor\\ngave the signal to embark, the victuals, the luggage, all our\\ninstruments, our weapons, and a goodly supply of sweet water, which we\\nhad collected from springs in the rocks, were placed on the raft.\\n\\nHans had, with considerable ingenuity, contrived a rudder, which enabled\\nhim to guide the floating apparatus with ease. He took the tiller, as a\\nmatter of course. The worthy man was as good a sailor as he was a guide\\nand duck hunter. I then let go the painter which held us to the shore,\\nthe sail was brought to the wind, and we made a rapid offing.\\n\\nOur sea voyage had at length commenced; and once more we were making for\\ndistant and unknown regions.\\n\\nJust as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been\\nconstructed, my uncle, who was very strong as to geographic\\nnomenclature, wanted to give it a name, and among others, suggested\\nmine.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, \"before you decide I have another to propose.\"\\n\\n\"Well; out with it.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to call it Gretchen. Port Gretchen will sound very well\\non our future map.\"\\n\\n\"Well then, Port Gretchen let it be,\" said the Professor.\\n\\nAnd thus it was that the memory of my dear girl was attached to our\\nadventurous and memorable expedition.\\n\\nWhen we left the shore the wind was blowing from the northward and\\neastward. We went directly before the wind at a much greater speed than\\nmight have been expected from a raft. The dense layers of atmosphere at\\nthat depth had great propelling power and acted upon the sail with\\nconsiderable force.\\n\\nAt the end of an hour, my uncle, who had been taking careful\\nobservations, was enabled to judge of the rapidity with which we moved.\\nIt was far beyond anything seen in the upper world.\\n\\n\"If,\" he said, \"we continue to advance at our present rate, we shall\\nhave traveled at least thirty leagues in twenty-four hours. With a mere\\nraft this is an almost incredible velocity.\"\\n\\nI certainly was surprised, and without making any reply went forward\\nupon the raft. Already the northern shore was fading away on the edge of\\nthe horizon. The two shores appeared to separate more and more, leaving\\na wide and open space for our departure. Before me I could see nothing\\nbut the vast and apparently limitless sea--upon which we floated--the\\nonly living objects in sight.\\n\\nHuge and dark clouds cast their grey shadows below--shadows which seemed\\nto crush that colorless and sullen water by their weight. Anything more\\nsuggestive of gloom and of regions of nether darkness I never beheld.\\nSilvery rays of electric light, reflected here and there upon some small\\nspots of water, brought up luminous sparkles in the long wake of our\\ncumbrous bark. Presently we were wholly out of sight of land; not a\\nvestige could be seen, nor any indication of where we were going. So\\nstill and motionless did we seem without any distant point to fix our\\neyes on that but for the phosphoric light at the wake of the raft I\\nshould have fancied that we were still and motionless.\\n\\nBut I knew that we were advancing at a very rapid rate.\\n\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock in the day, vast collections of seaweed were\\ndiscovered surrounding us on all sides. I was aware of the extraordinary\\nvegetative power of these plants, which have been known to creep along\\nthe bottom of the great ocean, and stop the advance of large ships. But\\nnever were seaweeds ever seen, so gigantic and wonderful as those of the\\nCentral Sea. I could well imagine how, seen at a distance, tossing and\\nheaving on the summit of the billows, the long lines of algae have been\\ntaken for living things, and thus have been fertile sources of the\\nbelief in sea serpents.\\n\\nOur raft swept past great specimens of fucus or seawrack, from three to\\nfour thousand feet in length, immense, incredibly long, looking like\\nsnakes that stretched out far beyond our horizon. It afforded me great\\namusement to gaze on their variegated ribbon-like endless lengths. Hour\\nafter hour passed without our coming to the termination of these\\nfloating weeds. If my astonishment increased, my patience was well-nigh\\nexhausted.\\n\\nWhat natural force could possibly have produced such abnormal and\\nextraordinary plants? What must have been the aspect of the globe,\\nduring the first centuries of its formation, when under the combined\\naction of heat and humidity, the vegetable kingdom occupied its vast\\nsurface to the exclusion of everything else?\\n\\nThese were considerations of never-ending interest for the geologist and\\nthe philosopher.\\n\\nAll this while we were advancing on our journey; and at length night\\ncame; but as I had remarked the evening before, the luminous state of\\nthe atmosphere was in nothing diminished. Whatever was the cause, it was\\na phenomenon upon the duration of which we could calculate with\\ncertainty.\\n\\nAs soon as our supper had been disposed of, and some little speculative\\nconversation indulged in, I stretched myself at the foot of the mast,\\nand presently went to sleep.\\n\\nHans remained motionless at the tiller, allowing the raft to rise and\\nfall on the waves. The wind being aft, and the sail square, all he had\\nto do was to keep his oar in the centre.\\n\\nEver since we had taken our departure from the newly named Port\\nGretchen, my worthy uncle had directed me to keep a regular log of our\\nday\\'s navigation, with instructions to put down even the most minute\\nparticulars, every interesting and curious phenomenon, the direction of\\nthe wind, our rate of sailing, the distance we went; in a word, every\\nincident of our extraordinary voyage.\\n\\nFrom our log, therefore, I tell the story of our voyage on the Central\\nSea.\\n\\n\\nFriday, August 14th. A steady breeze from the northwest. Raft\\nprogressing with extreme rapidity, and going perfectly straight. Coast\\nstill dimly visible about thirty leagues to leeward. Nothing to be seen\\nbeyond the horizon in front. The extraordinary intensity of the light\\nneither increases nor diminishes. It is singularly stationary. The\\nweather remarkably fine; that is to say, the clouds have ascended very\\nhigh, and are light and fleecy, and surrounded by an atmosphere\\nresembling silver in fusion.\\n\\nThermometer, +32 degrees centigrade.\\n\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock in the day our guide Hans having prepared and\\nbaited a hook, cast his line into the subterranean waters. The bait he\\nused was a small piece of meat, by means of which he concealed his hook.\\nAnxious as I was, I was for a long time doomed to disappointment. Were\\nthese waters supplied with fish or not? That was the important question.\\nNo--was my decided answer. Then there came a sudden and rather hard tug.\\nHans coolly drew it in, and with it a fish, which struggled violently to\\nescape.\\n\\n\"A fish!\" cried my uncle.\\n\\n\"It is a sturgeon!\" I cried, \"certainly a small sturgeon.\"\\n\\nThe Professor examined the fish carefully, noting every characteristic;\\nand he did not coincide in my opinion. The fish had a flat head, round\\nbody, and the lower extremities covered with bony scales; its mouth was\\nwholly without teeth, the pectoral fins, which were highly developed,\\nsprouted direct from the body, which properly speaking had no tail. The\\nanimal certainly belonged to the order in which naturalists class the\\nsturgeon, but it differed from that fish in many essential particulars.\\n\\nMy uncle, after all, was not mistaken. After a long and patient\\nexamination, he said:\\n\\n\"This fish, my dear boy, belongs to a family which has been extinct for\\nages, and of which no trace has ever been found on earth, except fossil\\nremains in the Devonian strata.\"\\n\\n\"You do not mean to say,\" I cried, \"that we have captured a live\\nspecimen of a fish belonging to the primitive stock that existed before\\nthe deluge?\"\\n\\n\"We have,\" said the Professor, who all this time was continuing his\\nobservations, \"and you may see by careful examination that these fossil\\nfish have no identity with existing species. To hold in one\\'s hand,\\ntherefore, a living specimen of the order, is enough to make a\\nnaturalist happy for life.\"\\n\\n\"But,\" cried I, \"to what family does it belong?\"\\n\\n\"To the order of Ganoides--an order of fish having angular scales,\\ncovered with bright enamel--forming one of the family of the\\nCephalaspides, of the genus--\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" I remarked, as I noticed my uncle hesitated to conclude.\\n\\n\"To the genus Pterychtis--yes, I am certain of it. Still, though I am\\nconfident of the correctness of my surmise, this fish offers to our\\nnotice a remarkable peculiarity, never known to exist in any other fish\\nbut those which are the natives of subterranean waters, wells, lakes, in\\ncaverns, and suchlike hidden pools.\"\\n\\n\"And what may that be?\"\\n\\n\"It is blind.\"\\n\\n\"Blind!\" I cried, much surprised.\\n\\n\"Not only blind,\" continued the Professor, \"but absolutely without\\norgans of sight.\"\\n\\nI now examined our discovery for myself. It was singular, to be sure,\\nbut it was really a fact. This, however, might be a solitary instance, I\\nsuggested. The hook was baited again and once more thrown into the\\nwater. This subterranean ocean must have been tolerably well supplied\\nwith fish, for in two hours we took a large number of Pterychtis, as\\nwell as other fish belonging to another supposed extinct family--the\\nDipterides (a genus of fish, furnished with two fins only, whence the\\nname), though my uncle could not class it exactly. All, without\\nexception, however, were blind. This unexpected capture enabled us to\\nrenew our stock of provisions in a very satisfactory way.\\n\\nWe were now convinced that this subterranean sea contained only fish\\nknown to us as fossil specimens--and fish and reptiles alike were all\\nthe more perfect the farther back they dated their origin.\\n\\nWe began to hope that we should find some of those saurians which\\nscience has succeeded in reconstructing from bits of bone or cartilage.\\n\\nI took up the telescope and carefully examined the horizon--looked over\\nthe whole sea; it was utterly and entirely deserted. Doubtless we were\\nstill too near the coast.\\n\\nAfter an examination of the ocean, I looked upward, towards the strange\\nand mysterious sky. Why should not one of the birds reconstructed by the\\nimmortal Cuvier flap his stupendous wings aloft in the dull strata of\\nsubterranean air? It would, of course, find quite sufficient food from\\nthe fish in the sea. I gazed for some time upon the void above. It was\\nas silent and as deserted as the shores we had but lately left.\\n\\nNevertheless, though I could neither see nor discover anything, my\\nimagination carried me away into wild hypotheses. I was in a kind of\\nwaking dream. I thought I saw on the surface of the water those enormous\\nantediluvian turtles as big as floating islands. Upon those dull and\\nsomber shores passed a spectral row of the mammifers of early days, the\\ngreat Liptotherium found in the cavernous hollow of the Brazilian hills,\\nthe Mesicotherium, a native of the glacial regions of Siberia.\\n\\nFarther on, the pachydermatous Lophrodon, that gigantic tapir, which\\nconcealed itself behind rocks, ready to do battle for its prey with the\\nAnoplotherium, a singular animal partaking of the nature of the\\nrhinoceros, the horse, the hippopotamus and the camel.\\n\\nThere was the giant Mastodon, twisting and turning his horrid trunk,\\nwith which he crushed the rocks of the shore to powder, while the\\nMegatherium--his back raised like a cat in a passion, his enormous claws\\nstretched out, dug into the earth for food, at the same time that he\\nawoke the sonorous echoes of the whole place with his terrible roar.\\n\\nHigher up still, the first monkey ever seen on the face of the globe\\nclambered, gamboling and playing up the granite hills. Still farther\\naway, ran the Pterodactyl, with the winged hand, gliding or rather\\nsailing through the dense and compressed air like a huge bat.\\n\\nAbove all, near the leaden granitic sky, were immense birds, more\\npowerful than the cassowary and the ostrich, which spread their mighty\\nwings and fluttered against the huge stone vault of the inland sea.\\n\\nI thought, such was the effect of my imagination, that I saw this whole\\ntribe of antediluvian creatures. I carried myself back to far ages, long\\nbefore man existed--when, in fact, the earth was in too imperfect a\\nstate for him to live upon it.\\n\\nMy dream was of countless ages before the existence of man. The\\nmammifers first disappeared, then the mighty birds, then the reptiles of\\nthe secondary period, presently the fish, the crustacea, the mollusks,\\nand finally the vertebrata. The zoophytes of the period of transition in\\ntheir turn sank into annihilation.\\n\\nThe whole panorama of the world\\'s life before the historic period,\\nseemed to be born over again, and mine was the only human heart that\\nbeat in this unpeopled world! There were no more seasons; there were no\\nmore climates; the natural heat of the world increased unceasingly, and\\nneutralized that of the great radiant Sun.\\n\\nVegetation was exaggerated in an extraordinary manner. I passed like a\\nshadow in the midst of brushwood as lofty as the giant trees of\\nCalifornia, and trod underfoot the moist and humid soil, reeking with a\\nrank and varied vegetation.\\n\\nI leaned against the huge column-like trunks of giant trees, to which\\nthose of Canada were as ferns. Whole ages passed, hundreds upon hundreds\\nof years were concentrated into a single day.\\n\\nNext, unrolled before me like a panorama, came the great and wondrous\\nseries of terrestrial transformations. Plants disappeared; the granitic\\nrocks lost all trace of solidity; the liquid state was suddenly\\nsubstituted for that which had before existed. This was caused by\\nintense heat acting on the organic matter of the earth. The waters\\nflowed over the whole surface of the globe; they boiled; they were\\nvolatilized, or turned into vapor; a kind of steam cloud wrapped the\\nwhole earth, the globe itself becoming at last nothing but one huge\\nsphere of gas, indescribable in color, between white heat and red, as\\nbig and as brilliant as the sun.\\n\\nIn the very centre of this prodigious mass, fourteen hundred thousand\\ntimes as large as our globe, I was whirled round in space, and brought\\ninto close conjunction with the planets. My body was subtilized, or\\nrather became volatile, and commingled in a state of atomic vapor, with\\nthe prodigious clouds, which rushed forward like a mighty comet into\\ninfinite space!\\n\\nWhat an extraordinary dream! Where would it finally take me? My feverish\\nhand began to write down the marvelous details--details more like the\\nimaginings of a lunatic than anything sober and real. I had during this\\nperiod of hallucination forgotten everything--the Professor, the guide,\\nand the raft on which we were floating. My mind was in a state of\\nsemioblivion.\\n\\n\"What is the matter, Harry?\" said my uncle suddenly.\\n\\nMy eyes, which were wide opened like those of a somnambulist, were fixed\\nupon him, but I did not see him, nor could I clearly make out anything\\naround me.\\n\\n\"Take care, my boy,\" again cried my uncle, \"you will fall into the sea.\"\\n\\nAs he uttered these words, I felt myself seized on the other side by the\\nfirm hand of our devoted guide. Had it not been for the presence of mind\\nof Hans, I must infallibly have fallen into the waves and been drowned.\\n\\n\"Have you gone mad?\" cried my uncle, shaking me on the other side.\\n\\n\"What--what is the matter?\" I said at last, coming to myself.\\n\\n\"Are you ill, Henry?\" continued the Professor in an anxious tone.\\n\\n\"No--no; but I have had an extraordinary dream. It, however, has passed\\naway. All now seems well,\" I added, looking around me with strangely\\npuzzled eyes.\\n\\n\"All right,\" said my uncle; \"a beautiful breeze, a splendid sea. We are\\ngoing along at a rapid rate, and if I am not out in my calculations we\\nshall soon see land. I shall not be sorry to exchange the narrow limits\\nof our raft for the mysterious strand of the subterranean ocean.\"\\n\\nAs my uncle uttered these words, I rose and carefully scanned the\\nhorizon. But the line of water was still confounded with the lowering\\nclouds that hung aloft, and in the distance appeared to touch the edge\\nof the water.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 30\\n\\nTERRIFIC SAURIAN COMBAT\\n\\n\\nSaturday, August 15th. The sea still retains its uniform monotony. The\\nsame leaden hue, the same eternal glare from above. No indication of\\nland being in sight. The horizon appears to retreat before us, more and\\nmore as we advance.\\n\\nMy head, still dull and heavy from the effects of my extraordinary\\ndream, which I cannot as yet banish from my mind.\\n\\nThe Professor, who has not dreamed, is, however, in one of his morose\\nand unaccountable humors. Spends his time in scanning the horizon, at\\nevery point of the compass. His telescope is raised every moment to his\\neyes, and when he finds nothing to give any clue to our whereabouts, he\\nassumes a Napoleonic attitude and walks anxiously.\\n\\nI remarked that my uncle, the Professor, had a strong tendency to resume\\nhis old impatient character, and I could not but make a note of this\\ndisagreeable circumstance in my journal. I saw clearly that it had\\nrequired all the influence of my danger and suffering, to extract from\\nhim one scintillation of humane feeling. Now that I was quite recovered,\\nhis original nature had conquered and obtained the upper hand.\\n\\nAnd, after all, what had he to be angry and annoyed about, now more than\\nat any other time? Was not the journey being accomplished under the most\\nfavorable circumstances? Was not the raft progressing with the most\\nmarvelous rapidity?\\n\\nWhat, then, could be the matter? After one or two preliminary hems, I\\ndetermined to inquire.\\n\\n\"You seem uneasy, Uncle,\" said I, when for about the hundredth time he\\nput down his telescope and walked up and down, muttering to himself.\\n\\n\"No, I am not uneasy,\" he replied in a dry harsh tone, \"by no means.\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I should have said impatient,\" I replied, softening the force\\nof my remark.\\n\\n\"Enough to make me so, I think.\"\\n\\n\"And yet we are advancing at a rate seldom attained by a raft,\" I\\nremarked.\\n\\n\"What matters that?\" cried my uncle. \"I am not vexed at the rate we go\\nat, but I am annoyed to find the sea so much vaster than I expected.\"\\n\\nI then recollected that the Professor, before our departure, had\\nestimated the length of this subterranean ocean as at most about thirty\\nleagues. Now we had traveled at least over thrice that distance without\\ndiscovering any trace of the distant shore. I began to understand my\\nuncle\\'s anger.\\n\\n\"We are not going down,\" suddenly exclaimed the Professor. \"We are not\\nprogressing with our great discoveries. All this is utter loss of time.\\nAfter all, I did not come from home to undertake a party of pleasure.\\nThis voyage on a raft over a pond annoys and wearies me.\"\\n\\nHe called this adventurous journey a party of pleasure, and this great\\ninland sea a pond!\\n\\n\"But,\" argued I, \"if we have followed the route indicated by the great\\nSaknussemm, we cannot be going far wrong.\"\\n\\n\"\\'That is the question,\\' as the great, the immortal Shakespeare, has it.\\nAre we following the route indicated by that wondrous sage? Did\\nSaknussemm ever fall in with this great sheet of water? If he did, did\\nhe cross it? I begin to fear that the rivulet we adopted for a guide has\\nled us wrong.\"\\n\\n\"In any case, we can never regret having come thus far. It is worth the\\nwhole journey to have enjoyed this magnificent spectacle--it is\\nsomething to have seen.\"\\n\\n\"I care nothing about seeing, nor about magnificent spectacles. I came\\ndown into the interior of the earth with an object, and that object I\\nmean to attain. Don\\'t talk to me about admiring scenery, or any other\\nsentimental trash.\"\\n\\nAfter this I thought it well to hold my tongue, and allow the Professor\\nto bite his lips until the blood came, without further remark.\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock in the evening, our matter-of-fact guide, Hans, asked for\\nhis week\\'s salary, and receiving his three rix-dollars, put them\\ncarefully in his pocket. He was perfectly contented and satisfied.\\n\\n\\nSunday, August 16th. Nothing new to record. The same weather as before.\\nThe wind has a slight tendency to freshen up, with signs of an\\napproaching gale. When I awoke, my first observation was in regard to\\nthe intensity of the light. I keep on fearing, day after day, that the\\nextraordinary electric phenomenon should become first obscured, and then\\ngo wholly out, leaving us in total darkness. Nothing, however, of the\\nkind occurs. The shadow of the raft, its mast and sails, is clearly\\ndistinguished on the surface of the water.\\n\\nThis wondrous sea is, after all, infinite in its extent. It must be\\nquite as wide as the Mediterranean--or perhaps even as the great\\nAtlantic Ocean. Why, after all, should it not be so?\\n\\nMy uncle has on more than one occasion, tried deep-sea soundings. He\\ntied the cross of one of our heaviest crowbars to the extremity of a\\ncord, which he allowed to run out to the extent of two hundred fathoms.\\nWe had the greatest difficulty in hoisting in our novel kind of lead.\\n\\nWhen the crowbar was finally dragged on board, Hans called my attention\\nto some singular marks upon its surface. The piece of iron looked as if\\nit had been crushed between two very hard substances.\\n\\nI looked at our worthy guide with an inquiring glance.\\n\\n\"Tander,\" said he.\\n\\nOf course I was at a loss to understand. I turned round towards my\\nuncle, absorbed in gloomy reflections. I had little wish to disturb him\\nfrom his reverie. I accordingly turned once more towards our worthy\\nIcelander.\\n\\nHans very quietly and significantly opened his mouth once or twice, as\\nif in the act of biting, and in this way made me understand his meaning.\\n\\n\"Teeth!\" cried I, with stupefaction, as I examined the bar of iron with\\nmore attention.\\n\\nYes. There can be no doubt about the matter. The indentations on the bar\\nof iron are the marks of teeth! What jaws must the owner of such molars\\nbe possessed of! Have we then, come upon a monster of unknown species,\\nwhich still exists within the vast waste of waters--a monster more\\nvoracious than a shark, more terrible and bulky than the whale? I am\\nunable to withdraw my eyes from the bar of iron, actually half crushed!\\n\\nIs, then, my dream about to come true--a dread and terrible reality?\\n\\nAll day my thoughts were bent upon these speculations, and my\\nimagination scarcely regained a degree of calmness and power of\\nreflection until after a sleep of many hours.\\n\\nThis day, as on other Sundays, we observed as a day of rest and pious\\nmeditation.\\n\\n\\nMonday, August 17th. I have been trying to realize from memory the\\nparticular instincts of those antediluvian animals of the secondary\\nperiod, which succeeding to the mollusca, to the crustacea, and to the\\nfish, preceded the appearance of the race of mammifers. The generation\\nof reptiles then reigned supreme upon the earth. These hideous monsters\\nruled everything in the seas of the secondary period, which formed the\\nstrata of which the Jura mountains are composed. Nature had endowed them\\nwith perfect organization. What a gigantic structure was theirs; what\\nvast and prodigious strength they possessed!\\n\\nThe existing saurians, which include all such reptiles as lizards,\\ncrocodiles, and alligators, even the largest and most formidable of\\ntheir class, are but feeble imitations of their mighty sires, the\\nanimals of ages long ago. If there were giants in the days of old, there\\nwere also gigantic animals.\\n\\nI shuddered as I evolved from my mind the idea and recollection of these\\nawful monsters. No eye of man had seen them in the flesh. They took\\ntheir walks abroad upon the face of the earth thousands of ages before\\nman came into existence, and their fossil bones, discovered in the\\nlimestone, have allowed us to reconstruct them anatomically, and thus to\\nget some faint idea of their colossal formation.\\n\\nI recollect once seeing in the great Museum of Hamburg the skeleton of\\none of these wonderful saurians. It measured no less than thirty feet\\nfrom the nose to the tail. Am I, then, an inhabitant of the earth of the\\npresent day, destined to find myself face to face with a representative\\nof this antediluvian family? I can scarcely believe it possible; I can\\nhardly believe it true. And yet these marks of powerful teeth upon the\\nbar of iron! Can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the\\nbite of a crocodile?\\n\\nMy eyes stare wildly and with terror upon the subterranean sea. Every\\nmoment I expect one of these monsters to rise from its vast cavernous\\ndepths.\\n\\nI fancy that the worthy Professor in some measure shares my notions, if\\nnot my fears, for, after an attentive examination of the crowbar, he\\ncast his eyes rapidly over the mighty and mysterious ocean.\\n\\n\"What could possess him to leave the land,\" I thought, \"as if the depth\\nof this water was of any importance to us. No doubt he has disturbed\\nsome terrible monster in his watery home, and perhaps we may pay dearly\\nfor our temerity.\"\\n\\nAnxious to be prepared for the worst, I examined our weapons, and saw\\nthat they were in a fit state for use. My uncle looked on at me and\\nnodded his head approvingly. He, too, has noticed what we have to fear.\\n\\nAlready the uplifting of the waters on the surface indicates that\\nsomething is in motion below. The danger approaches. It comes nearer and\\nnearer. It behooves us to be on the watch.\\n\\n\\nTuesday, August 18th. Evening came at last, the hour when the desire for\\nsleep caused our eyelids to be heavy. Night there is not, properly\\nspeaking, in this place, any more than there is in summer in the arctic\\nregions. Hans, however, is immovable at the rudder. When he snatches a\\nmoment of rest I really cannot say. I take advantage of his vigilance to\\ntake some little repose.\\n\\nBut two hours after I was awakened from a heavy sleep by an awful shock.\\nThe raft appeared to have struck upon a sunken rock. It was lifted right\\nout of the water by some wondrous and mysterious power, and then started\\noff twenty fathoms distant.\\n\\n\"Eh, what is it?\" cried my uncle starting up. \"Are we shipwrecked, or\\nwhat?\"\\n\\nHans raised his hand and pointed to where, about two hundred yards off,\\na large black mass was moving up and down.\\n\\nI looked with awe. My worst fears were realized.\\n\\n\"It is a colossal monster!\" I cried, clasping my hands.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" cried the agitated Professor, \"and there yonder is a huge sea\\nlizard of terrible size and shape.\"\\n\\n\"And farther on behold a prodigious crocodile. Look at his hideous jaws,\\nand that row of monstrous teeth. Ha! he has gone.\"\\n\\n\"A whale! a whale!\" shouted the Professor, \"I can see her enormous fins.\\nSee, see, how she blows air and water!\"\\n\\nTwo liquid columns rose to a vast height above the level of the sea,\\ninto which they fell with a terrific crash, waking up the echoes of that\\nawful place. We stood still--surprised, stupefied, terror-stricken at\\nthe sight of this group of fearful marine monsters, more hideous in the\\nreality than in my dream. They were of supernatural dimensions; the very\\nsmallest of the whole party could with ease have crushed our raft and\\nourselves with a single bite.\\n\\nHans, seizing the rudder which had flown out of his hand, puts it hard\\naweather in order to escape from such dangerous vicinity; but no sooner\\ndoes he do so, than he finds he is flying from Scylla to Charybdis. To\\nleeward is a turtle about forty feet wide, and a serpent quite as long,\\nwith an enormous and hideous head peering from out the waters.\\n\\nLook which way we will, it is impossible for us to fly. The fearful\\nreptiles advanced upon us; they turned and twisted about the raft with\\nawful rapidity. They formed around our devoted vessel a series of\\nconcentric circles. I took up my rifle in desperation. But what effect\\ncan a rifle ball produce upon the armor scales with which the bodies of\\nthese horrid monsters are covered?\\n\\nWe remain still and dumb from utter horror. They advance upon us, nearer\\nand nearer. Our fate appears certain, fearful and terrible. On one side\\nthe mighty crocodile, on the other the great sea serpent. The rest of\\nthe fearful crowd of marine prodigies have plunged beneath the briny\\nwaves and disappeared!\\n\\nI am about to fire at any risk and try the effect of a shot. Hans, the\\nguide, however, interfered by a sign to check me. The two hideous and\\nravenous monsters passed within fifty fathoms of the raft, and then made\\na rush at one another--their fury and rage preventing them from seeing\\nus.\\n\\nThe combat commenced. We distinctly made out every action of the two\\nhideous monsters.\\n\\nBut to my excited imagination the other animals appeared about to take\\npart in the fierce and deadly struggle--the monster, the whale, the\\nlizard, and the turtle. I distinctly saw them every moment. I pointed\\nthem out to the Icelander. But he only shook his head.\\n\\n\"Tva,\" he said.\\n\\n\"What--two only does he say. Surely he is mistaken,\" I cried in a tone\\nof wonder.\\n\\n\"He is quite right,\" replied my uncle coolly and philosophically,\\nexamining the terrible duel with his telescope and speaking as if he\\nwere in a lecture room.\\n\\n\"How can that be?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is so. The first of these hideous monsters has the snout of a\\nporpoise, the head of a lizard, the teeth of a crocodile; and it is this\\nthat has deceived us. It is the most fearful of all antediluvian\\nreptiles, the world--renowned Ichthyosaurus or great fish lizard.\"\\n\\n\"And the other?\"\\n\\n\"The other is a monstrous serpent, concealed under the hard vaulted\\nshell of the turtle, the terrible enemy of its fearful rival, the\\nPlesiosaurus, or sea crocodile.\"\\n\\nHans was quite right. The two monsters only, disturbed the surface of\\nthe sea!\\n\\nAt last have mortal eyes gazed upon two reptiles of the great primitive\\nocean! I see the flaming red eyes of the Ichthyosaurus, each as big, or\\nbigger than a man\\'s head. Nature in its infinite wisdom had gifted this\\nwondrous marine animal with an optical apparatus of extreme power,\\ncapable of resisting the pressure of the heavy layers of water which\\nrolled over him in the depths of the ocean where he usually fed. It has\\nby some authors truly been called the whale of the saurian race, for it\\nis as big and quick in its motions as our king of the seas. This one\\nmeasures not less than a hundred feet in length, and I can form some\\nidea of his girth when I see him lift his prodigious tail out of the\\nwaters. His jaw is of awful size and strength, and according to the\\nbest-informed naturalists, it does not contain less than a hundred and\\neighty-two teeth.\\n\\nThe other was the mighty Plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical\\ntrunk, with a short stumpy tail, with fins like a bank of oars in a\\nRoman galley.\\n\\nIts whole body covered by a carapace or shell, and its neck, as flexible\\nas that of a swan, rose more than thirty feet above the waves, a tower\\nof animated flesh!\\n\\nThese animals attacked one another with inconceivable fury. Such a\\ncombat was never seen before by mortal eyes, and to us who did see it,\\nit appeared more like the phantasmagoric creation of a dream than\\nanything else. They raised mountains of water, which dashed in spray\\nover the raft, already tossed to and fro by the waves. Twenty times we\\nseemed on the point of being upset and hurled headlong into the waves.\\nHideous hisses appeared to shake the gloomy granite roof of that mighty\\ncavern--hisses which carried terror to our hearts. The awful combatants\\nheld each other in a tight embrace. I could not make out one from the\\nother. Still the combat could not last forever; and woe unto us,\\nwhichsoever became the victor.\\n\\nOne hour, two hours, three hours passed away, without any decisive\\nresult. The struggle continued with the same deadly tenacity, but\\nwithout apparent result. The deadly opponents now approached, now drew\\naway from the raft. Once or twice we fancied they were about to leave us\\naltogether, but instead of that, they came nearer and nearer.\\n\\nWe crouched on the raft ready to fire at them at a moment\\'s notice, poor\\nas the prospect of hurting or terrifying them was. Still we were\\ndetermined not to perish without a struggle.\\n\\nSuddenly the Ichthyosaurus and the Plesiosaurus disappeared beneath the\\nwaves, leaving behind them a maelstrom in the midst of the sea. We were\\nnearly drawn down by the indraft of the water!\\n\\nSeveral minutes elapsed before anything was again seen. Was this\\nwonderful combat to end in the depths of the ocean? Was the last act of\\nthis terrible drama to take place without spectators?\\n\\nIt was impossible for us to say.\\n\\nSuddenly, at no great distance from us, an enormous mass rises out of\\nthe waters--the head of the great Plesiosaurus. The terrible monster is\\nnow wounded unto death. I can see nothing now of his enormous body. All\\nthat could be distinguished was his serpent-like neck, which he twisted\\nand curled in all the agonies of death. Now he struck the waters with it\\nas if it had been a gigantic whip, and then again wriggled like a worm\\ncut in two. The water was spurted up to a great distance in all\\ndirections. A great portion of it swept over our raft and nearly blinded\\nus. But soon the end of the beast approached nearer and nearer; his\\nmovements slackened visibly; his contortions almost ceased; and at last\\nthe body of the mighty snake lay an inert, dead mass on the surface of\\nthe now calm and placid waters.\\n\\nAs for the Ichthyosaurus, has he gone down to his mighty cavern under\\nthe sea to rest, or will he reappear to destroy us?\\n\\nThis question remained unanswered. And we had breathing time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 31\\n\\nTHE SEA MONSTER\\n\\n\\nWednesday, August 19th. Fortunately the wind, which for the present\\nblows with some violence, has allowed us to escape from the scene of the\\nunparalleled and extraordinary struggle. Hans with his usual\\nimperturbable calm remained at the helm. My uncle, who for a short time\\nhad been withdrawn from his absorbing reveries by the novel incidents of\\nthis sea fight, fell back again apparently into a brown study. His eyes\\nwere fixed impatiently on the widespread ocean.\\n\\nOur voyage now became monotonous and uniform. Dull as it has become, I\\nhave no desire to have it broken by any repetition of the perils and\\nadventures of yesterday.\\n\\n\\nThursday, August 20th. The wind is now N. N. E., and blows very\\nirregularly. It has changed to fitful gusts. The temperature is\\nexceedingly high. We are now progressing at the average rate of about\\nten miles and a half per hour.\\n\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock a distant sound as of thunder fell upon our ears. I\\nmake a note of the fact without even venturing a suggestion as to its\\ncause. It was one continued roar as of a sea falling over mighty rocks.\\n\\n\"Far off in the distance,\" said the Professor dogmatically, \"there is\\nsome rock or some island against which the sea lashed to fury by the\\nwind, is breaking violently.\"\\n\\nHans, without saying a word, clambered to the top of the mast, but could\\nmake out nothing. The ocean was level in every direction as far as the\\neye could reach.\\n\\nThree hours passed away without any sign to indicate what might be\\nbefore us. The sound began to assume that of a mighty cataract.\\n\\nI expressed my opinion on this point strongly to my uncle. He merely\\nshook his head. I, however, am strongly impressed by a conviction that I\\nam not wrong. Are we advancing towards some mighty waterfall which shall\\ncast us into the abyss? Probably this mode of descending into the abyss\\nmay be agreeable to the Professor, because it would be something like\\nthe vertical descent he is so eager to make. I entertain a very\\ndifferent opinion.\\n\\nWhatever be the truth, it is certain that not many leagues distant there\\nmust be some very extraordinary phenomenon, for as we advance the roar\\nbecomes something mighty and stupendous. Is it in the water, or in the\\nair?\\n\\nI cast hasty glances aloft at the suspended vapors, and I seek to\\npenetrate their mighty depths. But the vault above is tranquil. The\\nclouds, which are now elevated to the very summit, appear utterly still\\nand motionless, and completely lost in the irradiation of electric\\nlight. It is necessary, therefore, to seek for the cause of this\\nphenomenon elsewhere.\\n\\nI examine the horizon, now perfectly calm, pure, and free from all haze.\\nIts aspect still remains unchanged. But if this awful noise proceeds\\nfrom a cataract--if, so to speak in plain English, this vast interior\\nocean is precipitated into a lower basin--if these tremendous roars are\\nproduced by the noise of falling waters, the current would increase in\\nactivity, and its increasing swiftness would give me some idea of the\\nextent of the peril with which we are menaced. I consult the current. It\\nsimply does not exist: there is no such thing. An empty bottle cast into\\nthe water lies to leeward without motion.\\n\\nAbout four o\\'clock Hans rises, clambers up the mast, and reaches the\\ntruck itself. From this elevated position his looks are cast around.\\nThey take in a vast circumference of the ocean. At last, his eyes remain\\nfixed. His face expresses no astonishment, but his eyes slightly dilate.\\n\\n\"He has seen something at last,\" cried my uncle.\\n\\n\"I think so,\" I replied.\\n\\nHans came down, stood beside us, and pointed with his right hand to the\\nsouth.\\n\\n\"Der nere,\" he said.\\n\\n\"There,\" replied my uncle.\\n\\nAnd seizing his telescope, he looked at it with great attention for\\nabout a minute, which to me appeared an age. I knew not what to think or\\nexpect.\\n\\n\"Yes, yes,\" he cried in a tone of considerable surprise, \"there it is.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"A tremendous spurt of water rising out of the waves.\"\\n\\n\"Some other marine monster,\" I cried, already alarmed.\\n\\n\"Perhaps.\"\\n\\n\"Then let us steer more to the westward, for we know what we have to\\nexpect from antediluvian animals,\" was my eager reply.\\n\\n\"Go ahead,\" said my uncle.\\n\\nI turned towards Hans. Hans was at the tiller steering with his usual\\nimperturbable calm.\\n\\nNevertheless, if from the distance which separated us from this\\ncreature, a distance which must be estimated at not less than a dozen\\nleagues, one could see the column of water spurting from the blow-hole\\nof the great animal, his dimensions must be something preternatural. To\\nfly is, therefore, the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence. But\\nwe have not come into that part of the world to be prudent. Such is my\\nuncle\\'s determination.\\n\\nWe, accordingly, continued to advance. The nearer we come, the loftier\\nis the spouting water. What monster can fill himself with such huge\\nvolumes of water, and then unceasingly spout them out in such lofty\\njets?\\n\\nAt eight o\\'clock in the evening, reckoning as above ground, where there\\nis day and night, we are not more than two leagues from the mighty\\nbeast. Its long, black, enormous, mountainous body, lies on the top of\\nthe water like an island. But then sailors have been said to have gone\\nashore on sleeping whales, mistaking them for land. Is it illusion, or\\nis it fear? Its length cannot be less than a thousand fathoms. What,\\nthen, is this cetaceous monster of which no Cuvier ever thought?\\n\\nIt is quite motionless and presents the appearance of sleep. The sea\\nseems unable to lift him upwards; it is rather the waves which break on\\nhis huge and gigantic frame. The waterspout, rising to a height of five\\nhundred feet, breaks in spray with a dull, sullen roar.\\n\\nWe advance, like senseless lunatics, towards this mighty mass.\\n\\nI honestly confess that I was abjectly afraid. I declared that I would\\ngo no farther. I threatened in my terror to cut the sheet of the sail. I\\nattacked the Professor with considerable acrimony, calling him\\nfoolhardy, mad, I know not what. He made no answer.\\n\\nSuddenly the imperturbable Hans once more pointed his finger to the\\nmenacing object:\\n\\n\"<i>Holme</i>!\"\\n\\n\"An island!\" cried my uncle.\\n\\n\"An island?\" I replied, shrugging my shoulders at this poor attempt at\\ndeception.\\n\\n\"Of course it is,\" cried my uncle, bursting into a loud and joyous\\nlaugh.\\n\\n\"But the waterspout?\"\\n\\n\"Geyser,\" said Hans.\\n\\n\"Yes, of course--a geyser,\" replied my uncle, still laughing, \"a geyser\\nlike those common in Iceland. Jets like this are the great wonders of\\nthe country.\"\\n\\nAt first I would not allow that I had been so grossly deceived. What\\ncould be more ridiculous than to have taken an island for a marine\\nmonster? But kick as one may, one must yield to evidence, and I was\\nfinally convinced of my error. It was nothing, after all, but a natural\\nphenomenon.\\n\\nAs we approached nearer and nearer, the dimensions of the liquid sheaf\\nof waters became truly grand and stupendous. The island had, at a\\ndistance, presented the appearance of an enormous whale, whose head rose\\nhigh above the waters. The geyser, a word the Icelanders pronounce\\ngeysir, and which signifies fury, rose majestically from its summit.\\nDull detonations are heard every now and then, and the enormous jet,\\ntaken as it were with sudden fury, shakes its plume of vapor, and bounds\\ninto the first layer of the clouds. It is alone. Neither spurts of vapor\\nnor hot springs surround it, and the whole volcanic power of that region\\nis concentrated in one sublime column. The rays of electric light mix\\nwith this dazzling sheaf, every drop as it falls assuming the prismatic\\ncolors of the rainbow.\\n\\n\"Let us go on shore,\" said the Professor, after some minutes of silence.\\n\\nIt is necessary, however, to take great precaution, in order to avoid\\nthe weight of falling waters, which would cause the raft to founder in\\nan instant. Hans, however, steers admirably, and brings us to the other\\nextremity of the island.\\n\\nI was the first to leap on the rock. My uncle followed, while the\\neider-duck hunter remained still, like a man above any childish sources\\nof astonishment. We were now walking on granite mixed with siliceous\\nsandstone; the soil shivered under our feet like the sides of boilers in\\nwhich over-heated steam is forcibly confined. It is burning. We soon\\ncame in sight of the little central basin from which rose the geyser. I\\nplunged a thermometer into the water which ran bubbling from the centre,\\nand it marked a heat of a hundred and sixty-three degrees!\\n\\nThis water, therefore, came from some place where the heat was intense.\\nThis was singularly in contradiction with the theories of Professor\\nHardwigg. I could not help telling him my opinion on the subject.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he sharply, \"and what does this prove against my doctrine?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" replied I dryly, seeing that I was running my head against a\\nforegone conclusion.\\n\\nNevertheless, I am compelled to confess that until now we have been most\\nremarkably fortunate, and that this voyage is being accomplished in most\\nfavorable conditions of temperature; but it appears evident, in fact,\\ncertain, that we shall sooner or later arrive at one of those regions\\nwhere the central heat will reach its utmost limits, and will go far\\nbeyond all the possible gradations of thermometers.\\n\\nVisions of the Hades of the ancients, believed to be in the centre of\\nthe earth, floated through my imagination.\\n\\nWe shall, however, see what we shall see. That is the Professor\\'s\\nfavorite phrase now. Having christened the volcanic island by the name\\nof his nephew, the leader of the expedition turned away and gave the\\nsignal for embarkation.\\n\\nI stood still, however, for some minutes, gazing upon the magnificent\\ngeyser. I soon was able to perceive that the upward tendency of the\\nwater was irregular; now it diminished in intensity, and then, suddenly,\\nit regained new vigor, which I attributed to the variation of the\\npressure of the accumulated vapors in its reservoir.\\n\\nAt last we took our departure, going carefully round the projecting, and\\nrather dangerous, rocks of the southern side. Hans had taken advantage\\nof this brief halt to repair the raft.\\n\\nBefore we took our final departure from the island, however, I made some\\nobservations to calculate the distance we had gone over, and I put them\\ndown in my journal. Since we left Port Gretchen, we had traveled two\\nhundred and seventy leagues--more than eight hundred miles--on this\\ngreat inland sea; we were, therefore, six hundred and twenty leagues\\nfrom Iceland, and exactly under England.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 32\\n\\nTHE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS\\n\\n\\nFriday, August 21st. This morning the magnificent geyser had wholly\\ndisappeared. The wind had freshened up, and we were fast leaving the\\nneighborhood of Henry\\'s Island. Even the roaring sound of the mighty\\ncolumn was lost to the ear.\\n\\nThe weather, if, under the circumstances, we may use such an expression,\\nis about to change very suddenly. The atmosphere is being gradually\\nloaded with vapors, which carry with them the electricity formed by the\\nconstant evaporation of the saline waters; the clouds are slowly but\\nsensibly falling towards the sea, and are assuming a dark-olive texture;\\nthe electric rays can scarcely pierce through the opaque curtain which\\nhas fallen like a drop scene before this wondrous theater, on the stage\\nof which another and terrible drama is soon to be enacted. This time it\\nis no fight of animals; it is the fearful battle of the elements.\\n\\nI feel that I am very peculiarly influenced, as all creatures are on\\nland when a deluge is about to take place.\\n\\nThe cumuli, a perfectly oval kind of cloud, piled upon the south,\\npresented a most awful and sinister appearance, with the pitiless aspect\\noften seen before a storm. The air is extremely heavy; the sea is\\ncomparatively calm.\\n\\nIn the distance, the clouds have assumed the appearance of enormous\\nballs of cotton, or rather pods, piled one above the other in\\npicturesque confusion. By degrees, they appear to swell out, break, and\\ngain in number what they lose in grandeur; their heaviness is so great\\nthat they are unable to lift themselves from the horizon; but under the\\ninfluence of the upper currents of air, they are gradually broken up,\\nbecome much darker, and then present the appearance of one single layer\\nof a formidable character; now and then a lighter cloud, still lit up\\nfrom above, rebounds upon this grey carpet, and is lost in the opaque\\nmass.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that the entire atmosphere is saturated with\\nelectric fluid; I am myself wholly impregnated; my hairs literally stand\\non end as if under the influence of a galvanic battery. If one of my\\ncompanions ventured to touch me, I think he would receive rather a\\nviolent and unpleasant shock.\\n\\nAbout ten o\\'clock in the morning, the symptoms of the storm became more\\nthorough and decisive; the wind appeared to soften down as if to take\\nbreath for a renewed attack; the vast funereal pall above us looked like\\na huge bag--like the cave of AEolus, in which the storm was collecting\\nits forces for the attack.\\n\\nI tried all I could not to believe in the menacing signs of the sky, and\\nyet I could not avoid saying, as it were involuntarily:\\n\\n\"I believe we are going to have bad weather.\"\\n\\nThe Professor made me no answer. He was in a horrible, in a detestable\\nhumor--to see the ocean stretching interminably before his eyes. On\\nhearing my words he simply shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n\"We shall have a tremendous storm,\" I said again, pointing to the\\nhorizon. \"These clouds are falling lower and lower upon the sea, as if\\nto crush it.\"\\n\\nA great silence prevailed. The wind wholly ceased. Nature assumed a dead\\ncalm, and ceased to breathe. Upon the mast, where I noticed a sort of\\nslight ignis fatuus, the sail hangs in loose heavy folds. The raft is\\nmotionless in the midst of a dark heavy sea--without undulation, without\\nmotion. It is as still as glass. But as we are making no progress, what\\nis the use of keeping up the sail, which may be the cause of our\\nperdition if the tempest should suddenly strike us without warning.\\n\\n\"Let us lower the sail,\" I said, \"it is only an act of common prudence.\"\\n\\n\"No--no,\" cried my uncle, in an exasperated tone, \"a hundred times, no.\\nLet the wind strike us and do its worst, let the storm sweep us away\\nwhere it will--only let me see the glimmer of some coast--of some rocky\\ncliffs, even if they dash our raft into a thousand pieces. No! keep up\\nthe sail--no matter what happens.\"\\n\\nThese words were scarcely uttered when the southern horizon underwent a\\nsudden and violent change. The long accumulated vapors were resolved\\ninto water, and the air required to fill up the void produced became a\\nwild and raging tempest.\\n\\nIt came from the most distant corners of the mighty cavern. It raged\\nfrom every point of the compass. It roared; it yelled; it shrieked with\\nglee as of demons let loose. The darkness increased and became indeed\\ndarkness visible.\\n\\nThe raft rose and fell with the storm, and bounded over the waves. My\\nuncle was cast headlong upon the deck. I with great difficulty dragged\\nmyself towards him. He was holding on with might and main to the end of\\na cable, and appeared to gaze with pleasure and delight at the spectacle\\nof the unchained elements.\\n\\nHans never moved a muscle. His long hair driven hither and thither by\\nthe tempest and scattered wildly over his motionless face, gave him a\\nmost extraordinary appearance--for every single hair was illuminated by\\nlittle sparkling sprigs.\\n\\nHis countenance presents the extraordinary appearance of an antediluvian\\nman, a true contemporary of the Megatherium.\\n\\nStill the mast holds good against the storm. The sail spreads out and\\nfills like a soap bubble about to burst. The raft rushes on at a pace\\nimpossible to estimate, but still less swiftly than the body of water\\ndisplaced beneath it, the rapidity of which may be seen by the lines\\nwhich fly right and left in the wake.\\n\\n\"The sail, the sail!\" I cried, making a trumpet of my hands, and then\\nendeavoring to lower it.\\n\\n\"Let it alone!\" said my uncle, more exasperated than ever.\\n\\n\"<i>Nej</i>,\" said Hans, gently shaking his head.\\n\\nNevertheless, the rain formed a roaring cataract before this horizon of\\nwhich we were in search, and to which we were rushing like madmen.\\n\\nBut before this wilderness of waters reached us, the mighty veil of\\ncloud was torn in twain; the sea began to foam wildly; and the\\nelectricity, produced by some vast and extraordinary chemical action in\\nthe upper layer of cloud, is brought into play. To the fearful claps of\\nthunder are added dazzling flashes of lightning, such as I had never\\nseen. The flashes crossed one another, hurled from every side; while the\\nthunder came pealing like an echo. The mass of vapor becomes\\nincandescent; the hailstones which strike the metal of our boots and our\\nweapons are actually luminous; the waves as they rise appear to be\\nfire-eating monsters, beneath which seethes an intense fire, their\\ncrests surmounted by combs of flame.\\n\\nMy eyes are dazzled, blinded by the intensity of light, my ears are\\ndeafened by the awful roar of the elements. I am compelled to hold onto\\nthe mast, which bends like a reed beneath the violence of the storm, to\\nwhich none ever before seen by mariners bore any resemblance.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nHere my traveling notes become very incomplete, loose and vague. I have\\nonly been able to make out one or two fugitive observations, jotted down\\nin a mere mechanical way. But even their brevity, even their obscurity,\\nshow the emotions which overcame me.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nSunday, August 23rd. Where have we got to? In what region are we\\nwandering? We are still carried forward with inconceivable rapidity.\\n\\nThe night has been fearful, something not to be described. The storm\\nshows no signs of cessation. We exist in the midst of an uproar which\\nhas no name. The detonations as of artillery are incessant. Our ears\\nliterally bleed. We are unable to exchange a word, or hear each other\\nspeak.\\n\\nThe lightning never ceases to flash for a single instant. I can see the\\nzigzags after a rapid dart strike the arched roof of this mightiest of\\nmighty vaults. If it were to give way and fall upon us! Other lightnings\\nplunge their forked streaks in every direction, and take the form of\\nglobes of fire, which explode like bombshells over a beleaguered city.\\nThe general crash and roar do not apparently increase; it has already\\ngone far beyond what human ear can appreciate. If all the powder\\nmagazines in the world were to explode together, it would be impossible\\nfor us to hear worse noise.\\n\\nThere is a constant emission of light from the storm clouds; the\\nelectric matter is incessantly released; evidently the gaseous\\nprinciples of the air are out of order; innumerable columns of water\\nrush up like waterspouts, and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in\\nfoam.\\n\\nWhither are we going? My uncle still lies at full length upon the raft,\\nwithout speaking--without taking any note of time.\\n\\nThe heat increases. I look at the thermometer, to my surprise it\\nindicates--<i>The exact figure is here rubbed out in my manuscript.</i>\\n\\n\\nMonday, August 24th. This terrible storm will never end. Why should not\\nthis state of the atmosphere, so dense and murky, once modified, again\\nremain definitive?\\n\\nWe are utterly broken and harassed by fatigue. Hans remains just as\\nusual. The raft runs to the southeast invariably. We have now already\\nrun two hundred leagues from the newly discovered island.\\n\\nAbout twelve o\\'clock the storm became worse than ever. We are obliged\\nnow to fasten every bit of cargo tightly on the deck of the raft, or\\neverything would be swept away. We make ourselves fast, too, each man\\nlashing the other. The waves drive over us, so that several times we are\\nactually under water.\\n\\nWe had been under the painful necessity of abstaining from speech for\\nthree days and three nights. We opened our mouths, we moved our lips,\\nbut no sound came. Even when we placed our mouths to each other\\'s ears\\nit was the same.\\n\\nThe wind carried the voice away.\\n\\nMy uncle once contrived to get his head close to mine after several\\nalmost vain endeavors. He appeared to my nearly exhausted senses to\\narticulate some word. I had a notion, more from intuition than anything\\nelse, that he said to me, \"We are lost.\"\\n\\nI took out my notebook, from which under the most desperate\\ncircumstances I never parted, and wrote a few words as legibly as I\\ncould:\\n\\n\"Take in sail.\"\\n\\nWith a deep sigh he nodded his head and acquiesced.\\n\\nHis head had scarcely time to fall back in the position from which he\\nhad momentarily raised it than a disk or ball of fire appeared on the\\nvery edge of the raft--our devoted, our doomed craft. The mast and sail\\nare carried away bodily, and I see them swept away to a prodigious\\nheight like a kite.\\n\\nWe were frozen, actually shivered with terror. The ball of fire, half\\nwhite, half azure-colored, about the size of a ten-inch bombshell, moved\\nalong, turning with prodigious rapidity to leeward of the storm. It ran\\nabout here, there, and everywhere, it clambered up one of the bulwarks\\nof the raft, it leaped upon the sack of provisions, and then finally\\ndescended lightly, fell like a football and landed on our powder barrel.\\n\\nHorrible situation. An explosion of course was now inevitable.\\n\\nBy heaven\\'s mercy, it was not so.\\n\\nThe dazzling disk moved on one side, it approached Hans, who looked at\\nit with singular fixity; then it approached my uncle, who cast himself\\non his knees to avoid it; it came towards me, as I stood pale and\\nshuddering in the dazzling light and heat; it pirouetted round my feet,\\nwhich I endeavored to withdraw.\\n\\nAn odor of nitrous gas filled the whole air; it penetrated to the\\nthroat, to the lungs. I felt ready to choke.\\n\\nWhy is it that I cannot withdraw my feet? Are they riveted to the\\nflooring of the raft?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThe fall of the electric globe has turned all the iron on board into\\nloadstones--the instruments, the tools, the arms are clanging together\\nwith awful and horrible noise; the nails of my heavy boots adhere\\nclosely to the plate of iron incrustated in the wood. I cannot withdraw\\nmy foot.\\n\\nIt is the old story again of the mountain of adamant.\\n\\nAt last, by a violent and almost superhuman effort, I tear it away just\\nas the ball which is still executing its gyratory motions is about to\\nrun round it and drag me with it--if--\\n\\nOh, what intense stupendous light! The globe of fire bursts--we are\\nenveloped in cascades of living fire, which flood the space around with\\nluminous matter.\\n\\nThen all went out and darkness once more fell upon the deep! I had just\\ntime to see my uncle once more cast apparently senseless on the flooring\\nof the raft, Hans at the helm, \"spitting fire\" under the influence of\\nthe electricity which seemed to have gone through him.\\n\\nWhither are we going, I ask? and echo answers, Whither?\\n\\n.............\\n\\nTuesday, August 25th. I have just come out of a long fainting fit. The\\nawful and hideous storm still continues; the lightning has increased in\\nvividness, and pours out its fiery wrath like a brood of serpents let\\nloose in the atmosphere.\\n\\nAre we still upon the sea? Yes, and being carried along with incredible\\nvelocity.\\n\\nWe have passed under England, under the Channel, under France, probably\\nunder the whole extent of Europe.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nAnother awful clamor in the distance. This time it is certain that the\\nsea is breaking upon the rocks at no great distance. Then--\\n\\n..............\\n\\n..............\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 33\\n\\nOUR ROUTE REVERSED\\n\\n\\nHere ends what I call \"My Journal\" of our voyage on board the raft,\\nwhich journal was happily saved from the wreck. I proceed with my\\nnarrative as I did before I commenced my daily notes.\\n\\nWhat happened when the terrible shock took place, when the raft was cast\\nupon the rocky shore, it would be impossible for me now to say. I felt\\nmyself precipitated violently into the boiling waves, and if I escaped\\nfrom a certain and cruel death, it was wholly owing to the determination\\nof the faithful Hans, who, clutching me by the arm, saved me from the\\nyawning abyss.\\n\\nThe courageous Icelander then carried me in his powerful arms, far out\\nof the reach of the waves, and laid me down upon a burning expanse of\\nsand, where I found myself some time afterwards in the company of my\\nuncle, the Professor.\\n\\nThen he quietly returned towards the fatal rocks, against which the\\nfurious waves were beating, in order to save any stray waifs from the\\nwreck. This man was always practical and thoughtful. I could not utter a\\nword; I was quite overcome with emotion; my whole body was broken and\\nbruised with fatigue; it took hours before I was anything like myself.\\n\\nMeanwhile, there fell a fearful deluge of rain, drenching us to the\\nskin. Its very violence, however, proclaimed the approaching end of the\\nstorm. Some overhanging rocks afforded us a slight protection from the\\ntorrents.\\n\\nUnder this shelter, Hans prepared some food, which, however, I was\\nunable to touch; and, exhausted by the three weary days and nights of\\nwatching, we fell into a deep and painful sleep. My dreams were fearful,\\nbut at last exhausted nature asserted her supremacy, and I slumbered.\\n\\nNext day when I awoke the change was magical. The weather was\\nmagnificent. Air and sea, as if by mutual consent, had regained their\\nserenity. Every trace of the storm, even the faintest, had disappeared.\\nI was saluted on my awakening by the first joyous tones I had heard from\\nthe Professor for many a day. His gaiety, indeed, was something\\nterrible.\\n\\n\"Well, my lad,\" he cried, rubbing his hands together, \"have you slept\\nsoundly?\"\\n\\nMight it not have been supposed that we were in the old house on the\\nKonigstrasse; that I had just come down quietly to my breakfast; and\\nthat my marriage with Gretchen was to take place that very day? My\\nuncle\\'s coolness was exasperating.\\n\\nAlas, considering how the tempest had driven us in an easterly\\ndirection, we had passed under the whole of Germany, under the city of\\nHamburg where I had been so happy, under the very street which contained\\nall I loved and cared for in the world.\\n\\nIt was a positive fact that I was only separated from her by a distance\\nof forty leagues. But these forty leagues were of hard, impenetrable\\ngranite!\\n\\nAll these dreary and miserable reflections passed through my mind,\\nbefore I attempted to answer my uncle\\'s question.\\n\\n\"Why, what is the matter?\" he cried. \"Cannot you say whether you have\\nslept well or not?\"\\n\\n\"I have slept very well,\" was my reply, \"but every bone in my body\\naches. I suppose that will lead to nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing at all, my boy. It is only the result of the fatigue of the\\nlast few days--that is all.\"\\n\\n\"You appear--if I may be allowed to say so--to be very jolly this\\nmorning,\" I said.\\n\\n\"Delighted, my dear boy, delighted. Was never happier in my life. We\\nhave at last reached the wished-for port.\"\\n\\n\"The end of our expedition?\" cried I, in a tone of considerable\\nsurprise.\\n\\n\"No; but to the confines of that sea which I began to fear would never\\nend, but go round the whole world. We will now tranquilly resume our\\njourney by land, and once again endeavor to dive into the centre of the\\nearth.\"\\n\\n\"My dear uncle,\" I began, in a hesitating kind of way, \"allow me to ask\\nyou one question.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, Harry; a dozen if you think proper.\"\\n\\n\"One will suffice. How about getting back?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"How about getting back? What a question to ask. We have not as yet\\nreached the end of our journey.\"\\n\\n\"I know that. All I want to know is how you propose we shall manage the\\nreturn voyage?\"\\n\\n\"In the most simple manner in the world,\" said the imperturbable\\nProfessor. \"Once we reach the exact centre of this sphere, either we\\nshall find a new road by which to ascend to the surface, or we shall\\nsimply turn round and go back by the way we came. I have every reason to\\nbelieve that while we are traveling forward, it will not close behind\\nus.\"\\n\\n\"Then one of the first matters to see to will be to repair the raft,\"\\nwas my rather melancholy response.\\n\\n\"Of course. We must attend to that above all things,\" continued the\\nProfessor.\\n\\n\"Then comes the all-important question of provisions,\" I urged. \"Have we\\nanything like enough left to enable us to accomplish such great, such\\namazing, designs as you contemplate carrying out?\"\\n\\n\"I have seen into the matter, and my answer is in the affirmative. Hans\\nis a very clever fellow, and I have reason to believe that he has saved\\nthe greater part of the cargo. But the best way to satisfy your scruples\\nis to come and judge for yourself.\"\\n\\nSaying which, he led the way out of the kind of open grotto in which we\\nhad taken shelter. I had almost begun to hope that which I should rather\\nhave feared, and this was the impossibility of such a shipwreck leaving\\neven the slightest signs of what it had carried as freight. I was,\\nhowever, thoroughly mistaken.\\n\\nAs soon as I reached the shores of this inland sea, I found Hans\\nstanding gravely in the midst of a large number of things laid out in\\ncomplete order. My uncle wrung his hands with deep and silent gratitude.\\nHis heart was too full for speech.\\n\\nThis man, whose superhuman devotion to his employers I not only never\\nsaw surpassed, nor even equaled, had been hard at work all the time we\\nslept, and at the risk of his life had succeeded in saving the most\\nprecious articles of our cargo.\\n\\nOf course, under the circumstances, we necessarily experienced several\\nsevere losses. Our weapons had wholly vanished. But experience had\\ntaught us to do without them. The provision of powder had, however,\\nremained intact, after having narrowly escaped blowing us all to atoms\\nin the storm.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said the Professor, who was now ready to make the best of\\neverything, \"as we have no guns, all we have to do is to give up all\\nidea of hunting.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear sir, we can do without them, but what about all our\\ninstruments?\"\\n\\n\"Here is the manometer, the most useful of all, and which I gladly\\naccept in lieu of the rest. With it alone I can calculate the depth as\\nwe proceed; by its means alone I shall be able to decide when we have\\nreached the centre of the earth. Ha, ha! but for this little instrument\\nwe might make a mistake, and run the risk of coming out at the\\nantipodes!\"\\n\\nAll this was said amid bursts of unnatural laughter.\\n\\n\"But the compass,\" I cried, \"without that what can we do?\"\\n\\n\"Here it is, safe and sound!\" he cried, with real joy, \"ah, ah, and here\\nwe have the chronometer and the thermometers. Hans the hunter is indeed\\nan invaluable man!\"\\n\\nIt was impossible to deny this fact. As far as the nautical and other\\ninstruments were concerned, nothing was wanting. Then on further\\nexamination, I found ladders, cords, pickaxes, crowbars, and shovels,\\nall scattered about on the shore.\\n\\nThere was, however, finally the most important question of all, and that\\nwas, provisions.\\n\\n\"But what are we to do for food?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"Let us see to the commissariat department\", replied my uncle gravely.\\n\\nThe boxes which contained our supply of food for the voyage were placed\\nin a row along the strand, and were in a capital state of preservation;\\nthe sea had in every case respected their contents, and to sum up in one\\nsentence, taking into consideration, biscuits, salt meat, Schiedam and\\ndried fish, we could still calculate on having about four months\\'\\nsupply, if used with prudence and caution.\\n\\n\"Four months,\" cried the sanguine Professor in high glee. \"Then we shall\\nhave plenty of time both to go and to come, and with what remains I\\nundertake to give a grand dinner to my colleagues of the Johanneum.\"\\n\\nI sighed. I should by this time have become used to the temperament of\\nmy uncle, and yet this man astonished me more and more every day. He was\\nthe greatest human enigma I ever had known.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he, \"before we do anything else, we must lay in a stock of fresh\\nwater. The rain has fallen in abundance, and filled the hollows of the\\ngranite. There is a rich supply of water, and we have no fear of\\nsuffering from thirst, which in our circumstances is of the last\\nimportance. As for the raft, I shall recommend Hans to repair it to the\\nbest of his abilities; though I have every reason to believe we shall\\nnot require it again.\"\\n\\n\"How is that?\" I cried, more amazed than ever at my uncle\\'s style of\\nreasoning.\\n\\n\"I have an idea, my dear boy; it is none other than this simple fact; we\\nshall not come out by the same opening as that by which we entered.\"\\n\\nI began to look at my uncle with vague suspicion. An idea had more than\\nonce taken possession of me; and this was, that he was going mad. And\\nyet, little did I think how true and prophetic his words were doomed to\\nbe.\\n\\n\"And now,\" he said, \"having seen to all these matters of detail, to\\nbreakfast.\"\\n\\nI followed him to a sort of projecting cape, after he had given his last\\ninstructions to our guide. In this original position, with dried meat,\\nbiscuit, and a delicious cup of tea, we made a satisfactory meal--I may\\nsay one of the most welcome and pleasant I ever remember. Exhaustion,\\nthe keen atmosphere, the state of calm after so much agitation, all\\ncontributed to give me an excellent appetite. Indeed, it contributed\\nvery much to producing a pleasant and cheerful state of mind.\\n\\nWhile breakfast was in hand, and between the sips of warm tea, I asked\\nmy uncle if he had any idea of how we now stood in relation to the world\\nabove.\\n\\n\"For my part,\" I added, \"I think it will be rather difficult to\\ndetermine.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if we were compelled to fix the exact spot,\" said my uncle, \"it\\nmight be difficult, since during the three days of that awful tempest I\\ncould keep no account either of the quickness of our pace, or of the\\ndirection in which the raft was going. Still, we will endeavor to\\napproximate to the truth. We shall not, I believe, be so very far out.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if I recollect rightly,\" I replied, \"our last observation was\\nmade at the geyser island.\"\\n\\n\"Harry\\'s Island, my boy! Harry\\'s Island. Do not decline the honor of\\nhaving named it; given your name to an island discovered by us, the\\nfirst human beings who trod it since the creation of the world!\"\\n\\n\"Let it be so, then. At Harry\\'s Island we had already gone over two\\nhundred and seventy leagues of sea, and we were, I believe, about six\\nhundred leagues, more or less, from Iceland.\"\\n\\n\"Good. I am glad to see that you remember so well. Let us start from\\nthat point, and let us count four days of storm, during which our rate\\nof traveling must have been very great. I should say that our velocity\\nmust have been about eighty leagues to the twenty-four hours.\"\\n\\nI agreed that I thought this a fair calculation. There were then three\\nhundred leagues to be added to the grand total.\\n\\n\"Yes, and the Central Sea must extend at least six hundred leagues from\\nside to side. Do you know, my boy, Harry, that we have discovered an\\ninland lake larger than the Mediterranean?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, and we only know of its extent in one way. It may be\\nhundreds of miles in length.\"\\n\\n\"Very likely.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" said I, after calculating for some for some minutes, \"if your\\nprevisions are right, we are at this moment exactly under the\\nMediterranean itself.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think so?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I am almost certain of it. Are we not nine hundred leagues distant\\nfrom Reykjavik?\"\\n\\n\"That is perfectly true, and a famous bit of road we have traveled, my\\nboy. But why we should be under the Mediterranean more than under Turkey\\nor the Atlantic Ocean can only be known when we are sure of not having\\ndeviated from our course; and of this we know nothing.\"\\n\\n\"I do not think we were driven very far from our course; the wind\\nappears to me to have been always about the same. My opinion is that\\nthis shore must be situated to the southeast of Port Gretchen.\"\\n\\n\"Good--I hope so. It will, however, be easy to decide the matter by\\ntaking the bearings from our departure by means of the compass. Come\\nalong, and we will consult that invaluable invention.\"\\n\\nThe Professor now walked eagerly in the direction of the rock where the\\nindefatigable Hans had placed the instruments in safety. My uncle was\\ngay and lighthearted; he rubbed his hands, and assumed all sorts of\\nattitudes. He was to all appearance once more a young man. Since I had\\nknown him, never had he been so amiable and pleasant. I followed him,\\nrather curious to know whether I had made any mistake in my estimation\\nof our position.\\n\\nAs soon as we had reached the rock, my uncle took the compass, placed it\\nhorizontally before him, and looked keenly at the needle.\\n\\nAs he had at first shaken it to give it vivacity, it oscillated\\nconsiderably, and then slowly assumed its right position under the\\ninfluence of the magnetic power.\\n\\nThe Professor bent his eyes curiously over the wondrous instrument. A\\nviolent start immediately showed the extent of his emotion.\\n\\nHe closed his eyes, rubbed them, and took another and a keener survey.\\n\\nThen he turned slowly round to me, stupefaction depicted on his\\ncountenance.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" said I, beginning to be alarmed.\\n\\nHe could not speak. He was too overwhelmed for words. He simply pointed\\nto the instrument.\\n\\nI examined it eagerly according to his mute directions, and a loud cry\\nof surprise escaped my lips. The needle of the compass pointed due\\nnorth--in the direction we expected was the south!\\n\\nIt pointed to the shore instead of to the high seas.\\n\\nI shook the compass; I examined it with a curious and anxious eye. It\\nwas in a state of perfection. No blemish in any way explained the\\nphenomenon. Whatever position we forced the needle into, it returned\\ninvariably to the same unexpected point.\\n\\nIt was useless attempting to conceal from ourselves the fatal truth.\\n\\nThere could be no doubt about it, unwelcome as was the fact, that during\\nthe tempest, there had been a sudden slant of wind, of which we had been\\nunable to take any account, and thus the raft had carried us back to the\\nshores we had left, apparently forever, so many days before!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 34\\n\\nA VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY\\n\\n\\nIt would be altogether impossible for me to give any idea of the utter\\nastonishment which overcame the Professor on making this extraordinary\\ndiscovery. Amazement, incredulity, and rage were blended in such a way\\nas to alarm me.\\n\\nDuring the whole course of my Life I had never seen a man at first so\\nchapfallen; and then so furiously indignant.\\n\\nThe terrible fatigues of our sea voyage, the fearful dangers we had\\npassed through, had all, all, gone for nothing. We had to begin them all\\nover again.\\n\\nInstead of progressing, as we fondly expected, during a voyage of so\\nmany days, we had retreated. Every hour of our expedition on the raft\\nhad been so much lost time!\\n\\nPresently, however, the indomitable energy of my uncle overcame every\\nother consideration.\\n\\n\"So,\" he said, between his set teeth, \"fatality will play me these\\nterrible tricks. The elements themselves conspire to overwhelm me with\\nmortification. Air, fire, and water combine their united efforts to\\noppose my passage. Well, they shall see what the earnest will of a\\ndetermined man can do. I will not yield, I will not retreat even one\\ninch; and we shall see who shall triumph in this great contest--man or\\nnature.\"\\n\\nStanding upright on a rock, irritated and menacing, Professor Hardwigg,\\nlike the ferocious Ajax, seemed to defy the fates. I, however, took upon\\nmyself to interfere, and to impose some sort of check upon such\\ninsensate enthusiasm.\\n\\n\"Listen to me, Uncle,\" I said, in a firm but temperate tone of voice,\\n\"there must be some limit to ambition here below. It is utterly useless\\nto struggle against the impossible. Pray listen to reason. We are\\nutterly unprepared for a sea voyage; it is simply madness to think of\\nperforming a journey of five hundred leagues upon a wretched pile of\\nbeams, with a counterpane for a sail, a paltry stick for a mast, and a\\ntempest to contend with. As we are totally incapable of steering our\\nfrail craft, we shall become the mere plaything of the storm, and it is\\nacting the part of madmen if we, a second time, run any risk upon this\\ndangerous and treacherous Central Sea.\"\\n\\nThese are only a few of the reasons and arguments I put\\ntogether--reasons and arguments which to me appeared unanswerable. I was\\nallowed to go on without interruption for about ten minutes. The\\nexplanation to this I soon discovered. The Professor was not even\\nlistening, and did not hear a word of all my eloquence.\\n\\n\"To the raft!\" he cried in a hoarse voice, when I paused for a reply.\\n\\nSuch was the result of my strenuous effort to resist his iron will. I\\ntried again; I begged and implored him; I got into a passion; but I had\\nto deal with a will more determined than my own. I seemed to feel like\\nthe waves which fought and battled against the huge mass of granite at\\nour feet, which had smiled grimly for so many ages at their puny\\nefforts.\\n\\nHans, meanwhile, without taking part in our discussion, had been\\nrepairing the raft. One would have supposed that he instinctively\\nguessed at the further projects of my uncle.\\n\\nBy means of some fragments of cordage, he had again made the raft\\nseaworthy.\\n\\nWhile I had been speaking, he had hoisted a new mast and sail, the\\nlatter already fluttering and waving in the breeze.\\n\\nThe worthy Professor spoke a few words to our imperturbable guide, who\\nimmediately began to put our baggage on board and to prepare for our\\ndeparture. The atmosphere was now tolerably clear and pure, and the\\nnortheast wind blew steadily and serenely. It appeared likely to last\\nfor some time.\\n\\nWhat, then, could I do? Could I undertake to resist the iron will of two\\nmen? It was simply impossible if even I could have hoped for the support\\nof Hans. This, however, was out of the question. It appeared to me that\\nthe Icelander had set aside all personal will and identity. He was a\\npicture of abnegation.\\n\\nI could hope for nothing from one so infatuated with and devoted to his\\nmaster. All I could do, therefore, was to swim with the stream.\\n\\nIn a mood of stolid and sullen resignation, I was about to take my\\naccustomed place on the raft when my uncle placed his hand upon my\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\"There is no hurry, my boy,\" he said, \"we shall not start until\\ntomorrow.\"\\n\\nI looked the picture of resignation to the dire will of fate.\\n\\n\"Under the circumstances,\" he said, \"I ought to neglect no precautions.\\nAs fate has cast me upon these shores, I shall not leave without having\\ncompletely examined them.\"\\n\\nIn order to understand this remark, I must explain that though we had\\nbeen driven back to the northern shore, we had landed at a very\\ndifferent spot from that which had been our starting point.\\n\\nPort Gretchen must, we calculated, be very much to the westward.\\nNothing, therefore, was more natural and reasonable than that we should\\nreconnoiter this new shore upon which we had so unexpectedly landed.\\n\\n\"Let us go on a journey of discovery,\" I cried.\\n\\nAnd leaving Hans to his important operation, we started on our\\nexpedition. The distance between the foreshore at high water and the\\nfoot of the rocks was considerable. It would take about half an hour\\'s\\nwalking to get from one to the other.\\n\\nAs we trudged along, our feet crushed innumerable shells of every shape\\nand size--once the dwelling place of animals of every period of\\ncreation.\\n\\nI particularly noticed some enormous shells--carapaces (turtle and\\ntortoise species) the diameter of which exceeded fifteen feet.\\n\\nThey had in past ages belonged to those gigantic Glyptodons of the\\nPliocene period, of which the modern turtle is but a minute specimen. In\\naddition, the whole soil was covered by a vast quantity of stony relics,\\nhaving the appearance of flints worn by the action of the waves, and\\nlying in successive layers one above the other. I came to the conclusion\\nthat in past ages the sea must have covered the whole district. Upon the\\nscattered rocks, now lying far beyond its reach, the mighty waves of\\nages had left evident marks of their passage.\\n\\nOn reflection, this appeared to me partially to explain the existence of\\nthis remarkable ocean, forty leagues below the surface of the earth\\'s\\ncrust. According to my new, and perhaps fanciful, theory, this liquid\\nmass must be gradually lost in the deep bowels of the earth. I had also\\nno doubt that this mysterious sea was fed by infiltration of the ocean\\nabove, through imperceptible fissures.\\n\\nNevertheless, it was impossible not to admit that these fissures must\\nnow be nearly choked up, for if not, the cavern, or rather the immense\\nand stupendous reservoir, would have been completely filled in a short\\nspace of time. Perhaps even this water, having to contend against the\\naccumulated subterraneous fires of the interior of the earth, had become\\npartially vaporized. Hence the explanation of those heavy clouds\\nsuspended over our heads, and the superabundant display of that\\nelectricity which occasioned such terrible storms in this deep and\\ncavernous sea.\\n\\nThis lucid explanation of the phenomena we had witnessed appeared to me\\nquite satisfactory. However great and mighty the marvels of nature may\\nseem to us, they are always to be explained by physical reasons.\\nEverything is subordinate to some great law of nature.\\n\\nIt now appeared clear that we were walking upon a kind of sedimentary\\nsoil, formed like all the soils of that period, so frequent on the\\nsurface of the globe, by the subsidence of the waters. The Professor,\\nwho was now in his element, carefully examined every rocky fissure. Let\\nhim only find an opening and it directly became important to him to\\nexamine its depth.\\n\\nFor a whole mile we followed the windings of the Central Sea, when\\nsuddenly an important change took place in the aspect of the soil. It\\nseemed to have been rudely cast up, convulsionized, as it were, by a\\nviolent upheaving of the lower strata. In many places, hollows here and\\nhillocks there attested great dislocations at some other period of the\\nterrestrial mass.\\n\\nWe advanced with great difficulty over the broken masses of granite\\nmixed with flint, quartz, and alluvial deposits, when a large field,\\nmore even than a field, a plain of bones, appeared suddenly before our\\neyes! It looked like an immense cemetery, where generation after\\ngeneration had mingled their mortal dust.\\n\\nLofty barrows of early remains rose at intervals. They undulated away to\\nthe limits of the distant horizon and were lost in a thick and brown\\nfog.\\n\\nOn that spot, some three square miles in extent, was accumulated the\\nwhole history of animal life--scarcely one creature upon the\\ncomparatively modern soil of the upper and inhabited world had not there\\nexisted.\\n\\nNevertheless, we were drawn forward by an all-absorbing and impatient\\ncuriosity. Our feet crushed with a dry and crackling sound the remains\\nof those prehistoric fossils, for which the museums of great cities\\nquarrel, even when they obtain only rare and curious morsels. A thousand\\nsuch naturalists as Cuvier would not have sufficed to recompose the\\nskeletons of the organic beings which lay in this magnificent osseous\\ncollection.\\n\\nI was utterly confounded. My uncle stood for some minutes with his arms\\nraised on high towards the thick granite vault which served us for a\\nsky. His mouth was wide open; his eyes sparkled wildly behind his\\nspectacles (which he had fortunately saved), his head bobbed up and down\\nand from side to side, while his whole attitude and mien expressed\\nunbounded astonishment.\\n\\nHe stood in the presence of an endless, wondrous, and inexhaustibly rich\\ncollection of antediluvian monsters, piled up for his own private and\\npeculiar satisfaction.\\n\\nFancy an enthusiastic lover of books carried suddenly into the very\\nmidst of the famous library of Alexandria burned by the sacrilegious\\nOmar, and which some miracle had restored to its pristine splendor! Such\\nwas something of the state of mind in which Uncle Hardwigg was now\\nplaced.\\n\\nFor some time he stood thus, literally aghast at the magnitude of his\\ndiscovery.\\n\\nBut it was even a greater excitement when, darting wildly over this mass\\nof organic dust, he caught up a naked skull and addressed me in a\\nquivering voice:\\n\\n\"Harry, my boy--Harry--this is a human head!\"\\n\\n\"A human head, Uncle!\" I said, no less amazed and stupefied than\\nhimself.\\n\\n\"Yes, nephew. Ah! Mr. Milne-Edwards--ah! Mr. De Quatrefages--why are you\\nnot here where I am--I, Professor Hardwigg!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 35\\n\\nDISCOVERY UPON DISCOVERY\\n\\n\\nIn order fully to understand the exclamation made by my uncle, and his\\nallusions to these illustrious and learned men, it will be necessary to\\nenter into certain explanations in regard to a circumstance of the\\nhighest importance to paleontology, or the science of fossil life, which\\nhad taken place a short time before our departure from the upper regions\\nof the earth.\\n\\nOn the 28th of March, 1863, some navigators under the direction of M.\\nBoucher de Perthes, were at work in the great quarries of\\nMoulin-Quignon, near Abbeville, in the department of the Somme, in\\nFrance. While at work, they unexpectedly came upon a human jawbone\\nburied fourteen feet below the surface of the soil. It was the first\\nfossil of the kind that had ever been brought to the light of day. Near\\nthis unexpected human relic were found stone hatchets and carved flints,\\ncolored and clothed by time in one uniform brilliant tint of verdigris.\\n\\nThe report of this extraordinary and unexpected discovery spread not\\nonly all over France, but over England and Germany. Many learned men\\nbelonging to various scientific bodies, and noteworthy among others,\\nMessrs. Milne-Edwards and De Quatrefages, took the affair very much to\\nheart, demonstrated the incontestable authenticity of the bone in\\nquestion, and became--to use the phrase then recognized in England--the\\nmost ardent supporters of the \"jawbone question.\"\\n\\nTo the eminent geologists of the United Kingdom who looked upon the fact\\nas certain--Messrs. Falconer, Buck, Carpenter, and others--were soon\\nunited the learned men of Germany, and among those in the first rank,\\nthe most eager, the most enthusiastic, was my worthy uncle, Professor\\nHardwigg.\\n\\nThe authenticity of a human fossil of the Quaternary period seemed then\\nto be incontestably demonstrated, and even to be admitted by the most\\nskeptical.\\n\\nThis system or theory, call it what you will, had, it is true, a bitter\\nadversary in M. Elie de Beaumont. This learned man, who holds such a\\nhigh place in the scientific world, holds that the soil of\\nMoulin-Quignon does not belong to the diluvium but to a much less\\nancient stratum, and, in accordance with Cuvier in this respect, he\\nwould by no means admit that the human species was contemporary with the\\nanimals of the Quaternary epoch. My worthy uncle, Professor Hardwigg, in\\nconcert with the great majority of geologists, had held firm, had\\ndisputed, discussed, and finally, after considerable talking and\\nwriting, M. Elie de Beaumont had been pretty well left alone in his\\nopinions.\\n\\nWe were familiar with all the details of this discussion, but were far\\nfrom being aware then that since our departure the matter had entered\\nupon a new phase. Other similar jawbones, though belonging to\\nindividuals of varied types and very different natures, had been found\\nin the movable grey sands of certain grottoes in France, Switzerland,\\nand Belgium; together with arms, utensils, tools, bones of children, of\\nmen in the prime of life, and of old men. The existence of men in the\\nQuaternary period became, therefore, more positive every day.\\n\\nBut this was far from being all. New remains, dug up from the Pliocene\\nor Tertiary deposits, had enabled the more far-seeing or audacious among\\nlearned men to assign even a far greater degree of antiquity to the\\nhuman race. These remains, it is true, were not those of men; that is,\\nwere not the bones of men, but objects decidedly having served the human\\nrace: shinbones, thighbones of fossil animals, regularly scooped out,\\nand in fact sculptured--bearing the unmistakable signs of human\\nhandiwork.\\n\\nBy means of these wondrous and unexpected discoveries, man ascended\\nendless centuries in the scale of time; he, in fact, preceded the\\nmastodon; became the contemporary of the <i>Elephas meridionalis</i>--the\\nsouthern elephant; acquired an antiquity of over a hundred thousand\\nyears, since that is the date given by the most eminent geologists to\\nthe Pliocene period of the earth. Such was then the state of\\npaleontologic science, and what we moreover knew sufficed to explain our\\nattitude before this great cemetery of the plains of the Hardwigg Ocean.\\n\\nIt will now be easy to understand the Professor\\'s mingled astonishment\\nand joy when, on advancing about twenty yards, he found himself in the\\npresence of, I may say face to face with, a specimen of the human race\\nactually belonging to the Quaternary period!\\n\\nIt was indeed a human skull, perfectly recognizable. Had a soil of very\\npeculiar nature, like that of the cemetery of St. Michel at Bordeaux,\\npreserved it during countless ages? This was the question I asked\\nmyself, but which I was wholly unable to answer. But this head with\\nstretched and parchmenty skin, with the teeth whole, the hair abundant,\\nwas before our eyes as in life!\\n\\nI stood mute, almost paralyzed with wonder and awe before this dread\\napparition of another age. My uncle, who on almost every occasion was a\\ngreat talker, remained for a time completely dumfounded. He was too full\\nof emotion for speech to be possible. After a while, however, we raised\\nup the body to which the skull belonged. We stood it on end. It seemed,\\nto our excited imaginations, to look at us with its terrible hollow\\neyes.\\n\\nAfter some minutes of silence, the man was vanquished by the Professor.\\nHuman instincts succumbed to scientific pride and exultation. Professor\\nHardwigg, carried away by his enthusiasm, forgot all the circumstances\\nof our journey, the extraordinary position in which we were placed, the\\nimmense cavern which stretched far away over our heads. There can be no\\ndoubt that he thought himself at the Institution addressing his\\nattentive pupils, for he put on his most doctorial style, waved his\\nhand, and began:\\n\\n\"Gentlemen, I have the honor on this auspicious occasion to present to\\nyou a man of the Quaternary period of our globe. Many learned men have\\ndenied his very existence, while other able persons, perhaps of even\\nhigher authority, have affirmed their belief in the reality of his life.\\nIf the St. Thomases of paleontology were present, they would\\nreverentially touch him with their fingers and believe in his existence,\\nthus acknowledging their obstinate heresy. I know that science should be\\ncareful in relation to all discoveries of this nature. I am not without\\nhaving heard of the many Barnums and other quacks who have made a trade\\nof suchlike pretended discoveries. I have, of course, heard of the\\ndiscovery of the kneebones of Ajax, of the pretended finding of the body\\nof Orestes by the Spartiates, and of the body of Asterius, ten spans\\nlong, fifteen feet--of which we read in Pausanias.\\n\\n\"I have read everything in relation to the skeleton of Trapani,\\ndiscovered in the fourteenth century, and which many persons chose to\\nregard as that of Polyphemus, and the history of the giant dug up during\\nthe sixteenth century in the environs of Palmyra. You are well aware as\\nI am, gentlemen, of the existence of the celebrated analysis made near\\nLucerne, in 1577, of the great bones which the celebrated Doctor Felix\\nPlater declared belonged to a giant about nineteen feet high. I have\\ndevoured all the treatises of Cassanion, and all those memoirs,\\npamphlets, speeches, and replies published in reference to the skeleton\\nof Teutobochus, king of the Cimbri, the invader of Gaul, dug out of a\\ngravel pit in Dauphine, in 1613. In the eighteenth century I should have\\ndenied, with Peter Campet, the existence of the preadamites of\\nScheuchzer. I have had in my hands the writing called Gigans--\"\\n\\nHere my uncle was afflicted by the natural infirmity which prevented him\\nfrom pronouncing difficult words in public. It was not exactly\\nstuttering, but a strange sort of constitutional hesitation.\\n\\n\"The writing named Gigans--\" he repeated.\\n\\nHe, however, could get no further.\\n\\n\"Giganteo--\"\\n\\nImpossible! The unfortunate word would not come out. There would have\\nbeen great laughter at the Institution, had the mistake happened there.\\n\\n\"Gigantosteology!\" at last exclaimed Professor Hardwigg between two\\nsavage growls.\\n\\nHaving got over our difficulty, and getting more and more excited--\\n\\n\"Yes, gentlemen, I am well acquainted with all these matters, and know,\\nalso, that Cuvier and Blumenbach fully recognized in these bones the\\nundeniable remains of mammoths of the Quaternary period. But after what\\nwe now see, to allow a doubt is to insult scientific inquiry. There is\\nthe body; you can see it; you can touch it. It is not a skeleton, it is\\na complete and uninjured body, preserved with an anthropological\\nobject.\"\\n\\nI did not attempt to controvert this singular and astounding assertion.\\n\\n\"If I could but wash this corpse in a solution of sulphuric acid,\"\\ncontinued my uncle, \"I would undertake to remove all the earthy\\nparticles, and these resplendent shells, which are incrusted all over\\nthis body. But I am without this precious dissolving medium.\\nNevertheless, such as it is, this body will tell its own history.\"\\n\\nHere the Professor held up the fossil body, and exhibited it with rare\\ndexterity. No professional showman could have shown more activity.\\n\\n\"As on examination you will see,\" my uncle continued, \"it is only about\\nsix feet in length, which is a long way from the pretended giants of\\nearly days. As to the particular race to which it belonged, it is\\nincontestably Caucasian. It is of the white race, that is, of our own.\\nThe skull of this fossil being is a perfect ovoid without any remarkable\\nor prominent development of the cheekbones, and without any projection\\nof the jaw. It presents no indication of the prognathism which modifies\\nthe facial angle.[4] Measure the angle for yourselves, and you will find\\nthat it is just ninety degrees. But I will advance still farther on the\\nroad of inquiry and deduction, and I dare venture to say that this human\\nsample or specimen belongs to the Japhetic family, which spread over the\\nworld from India to the uttermost limits of western Europe. There is no\\noccasion, gentlemen, to smile at my remarks.\"\\n\\n[4] The facial angle is formed by two planes--one more or less vertical\\nwhich is in a straight line with the forehead and the incisors; the\\nother, horizontal, which passes through the organs of hearing, and the\\nlower nasal bone. Prognathism, in anthropological language, means that\\nparticular projection of the jaw which modifies the facial angle.\\n\\nOf course nobody smiled. But the excellent Professor was so accustomed\\nto beaming countenances at his lectures, that he believed he saw all his\\naudience laughing during the delivery of his learned dissertation.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he continued, with renewed animation, \"this is a fossil man, a\\ncontemporary of the mastodons, with the bones of which this whole\\namphitheater is covered. But if I am called on to explain how he came to\\nthis place, how these various strata by which he is covered have fallen\\ninto this vast cavity, I can undertake to give you no explanation.\\nDoubtless, if we carry ourselves back to the Quaternary epoch, we shall\\nfind that great and mighty convulsions took place in the crust of the\\nearth; the continually cooling operation, through which the earth had to\\npass, produced fissures, landslips, and chasms, through which a large\\nportion of the earth made its way. I come to no absolute conclusion, but\\nthere is the man, surrounded by the works of his hands, his hatchets and\\nhis carved flints, which belong to the stony period; and the only\\nrational supposition is, that, like myself, he visited the centre of the\\nearth as a traveling tourist, a pioneer of science. At all events, there\\ncan be no doubt of his great age, and of his being one of the oldest\\nrace of human beings.\"\\n\\nThe Professor with these words ceased his oration, and I burst forth\\ninto loud and \"unanimous\" applause. Besides, after all, my uncle was\\nright. Much more learned men than his nephew would have found it rather\\nhard to refute his facts and arguments.\\n\\nAnother circumstance soon presented itself. This fossilized body was not\\nthe only one in this vast plain of bones--the cemetery of an extinct\\nworld. Other bodies were found, as we trod the dusty plain, and my uncle\\nwas able to choose the most marvelous of these specimens in order to\\nconvince the most incredulous.\\n\\nIn truth, it was a surprising spectacle, the successive remains of\\ngenerations and generations of men and animals confounded together in\\none vast cemetery. But a great question now presented itself to our\\nnotice, and one we were actually afraid to contemplate in all its\\nbearings.\\n\\nHad these once animated beings been buried so far beneath the soil by\\nsome tremendous convulsion of nature, after they had been earth to earth\\nand ashes to ashes, or had they lived here below, in this subterranean\\nworld, under this factitious sky, borne, married, and given in marriage,\\nand died at last, just like ordinary inhabitants of the earth?\\n\\nUp to the present moment, marine monsters, fish, and suchlike animals\\nhad alone been seen alive!\\n\\nThe question which rendered us rather uneasy, was a pertinent one. Were\\nany of these men of the abyss wandering about the deserted shores of\\nthis wondrous sea of the centre of the earth?\\n\\nThis was a question which rendered me very uneasy and uncomfortable.\\nHow, should they really be in existence, would they receive us men from\\nabove?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 36\\n\\nWHAT IS IT?\\n\\n\\nFor a long and weary hour we tramped over this great bed of bones. We\\nadvanced regardless of everything, drawn on by ardent curiosity. What\\nother marvels did this great cavern contain--what other wondrous\\ntreasures for the scientific man? My eyes were quite prepared for any\\nnumber of surprises, my imagination lived in expectation of something\\nnew and wonderful.\\n\\nThe borders of the great Central Ocean had for some time disappeared\\nbehind the hills that were scattered over the ground occupied by the\\nplain of bones. The imprudent and enthusiastic Professor, who did not\\ncare whether he lost himself or not, hurried me forward. We advanced\\nsilently, bathed in waves of electric fluid.\\n\\nBy reason of a phenomenon which I cannot explain, and thanks to its\\nextreme diffusion, now complete, the light illumined equally the sides\\nof every hill and rock. Its seat appeared to be nowhere, in no\\ndetermined force, and produced no shade whatever.\\n\\nThe appearance presented was that of a tropical country at midday in\\nsummer--in the midst of the equatorial regions and under the vertical\\nrays of the sun.\\n\\nAll signs of vapor had disappeared. The rocks, the distant mountains,\\nsome confused masses of far-off forests, assumed a weird and mysterious\\naspect under this equal distribution of the luminous fluid!\\n\\nWe resembled, to a certain extent, the mysterious personage in one of\\nHoffmann\\'s fantastic tales--the man who lost his shadow.\\n\\nAfter we had walked about a mile farther, we came to the edge of a vast\\nforest not, however, one of the vast mushroom forests we had discovered\\nnear Port Gretchen.\\n\\nIt was the glorious and wild vegetation of the Tertiary period, in all\\nits superb magnificence. Huge palms, of a species now unknown, superb\\npalmacites--a genus of fossil palms from the coal formation--pines,\\nyews, cypress, and conifers or cone-bearing trees, the whole bound\\ntogether by an inextricable and complicated mass of creeping plants.\\n\\nA beautiful carpet of mosses and ferns grew beneath the trees. Pleasant\\nbrooks murmured beneath umbrageous boughs, little worthy of this name,\\nfor no shade did they give. Upon their borders grew small treelike\\nshrubs, such as are seen in the hot countries on our own inhabited\\nglobe.\\n\\nThe one thing wanting in these plants, these shrubs, these trees--was\\ncolor! Forever deprived of the vivifying warmth of the sun, they were\\nvapid and colorless. All shade was lost in one uniform tint, of a brown\\nand faded character. The leaves were wholly devoid of verdure, and the\\nflowers, so numerous during the Tertiary period which gave them birth,\\nwere without color and without perfume, something like paper discolored\\nby long exposure to the atmosphere.\\n\\nMy uncle ventured beneath the gigantic groves. I followed him, though\\nnot without a certain amount of apprehension. Since nature had shown\\nherself capable of producing such stupendous vegetable supplies, why\\nmight we not meet with mammals just as large, and therefore dangerous?\\n\\nI particularly remarked, in the clearings left by trees that had fallen\\nand been partially consumed by time, many leguminous (beanlike) shrubs,\\nsuch as the maple and other eatable trees, dear to ruminating animals.\\nThen there appeared confounded together and intermixed, the trees of\\nsuch varied lands, specimens of the vegetation of every part of the\\nglobe; there was the oak near the palm tree, the Australian eucalyptus,\\nan interesting class of the order Myrtaceae--leaning against the tall\\nNorwegian pine, the poplar of the north, mixing its branches with those\\nof the New Zealand kauris. It was enough to drive the most ingenious\\nclassifier of the upper regions out of his mind, and to upset all his\\nreceived ideas about botany.\\n\\nSuddenly I stopped short and restrained my uncle.\\n\\nThe extreme diffuseness of the light enabled me to see the smallest\\nobjects in the distant copses. I thought I saw--no, I really did see\\nwith my own eyes--immense, gigantic animals moving about under the\\nmighty trees. Yes, they were truly gigantic animals, a whole herd of\\nmastodons, not fossils, but living, and exactly like those discovered in\\n1801, on the marshy banks of the great Ohio, in North America.\\n\\nYes, I could see these enormous elephants, whose trunks were tearing\\ndown large boughs, and working in and out the trees like a legion of\\nserpents. I could hear the sounds of the mighty tusks uprooting huge\\ntrees!\\n\\nThe boughs crackled, and the whole masses of leaves and green branches\\nwent down the capacious throats of these terrible monsters!\\n\\nThat wondrous dream, when I saw the antehistorical times revivified,\\nwhen the Tertiary and Quaternary periods passed before me, was now\\nrealized!\\n\\nAnd there we were alone, far down in the bowels of the earth, at the\\nmercy of its ferocious inhabitants!\\n\\nMy uncle paused, full of wonder and astonishment.\\n\\n\"Come!\" he said at last, when his first surprise was over, \"Come along,\\nmy boy, and let us see them nearer.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied I, restraining his efforts to drag me forward, \"we are\\nwholly without arms. What should we do in the midst of that flock of\\ngigantic quadrupeds? Come away, Uncle, I implore you. No human creature\\ncan with impunity brave the ferocious anger of these monsters.\"\\n\\n\"No human creature,\" said my uncle, suddenly lowering his voice to a\\nmysterious whisper, \"you are mistaken, my dear Henry. Look! look yonder!\\nIt seems to me that I behold a human being--a being like ourselves--a\\nman!\"\\n\\nI looked, shrugging my shoulders, decided to push incredulity to its\\nvery last limits. But whatever might have been my wish, I was compelled\\nto yield to the weight of ocular demonstration.\\n\\nYes--not more than a quarter of a mile off, leaning against the trunk of\\nan enormous tree, was a human being--a Proteus of these subterranean\\nregions, a new son of Neptune keeping this innumerable herd of\\nmastodons.\\n\\n\\n     Immanis pecoris custos, immanior ipse![5]\\n\\n\\n\\n[5] The keeper of gigantic cattle, himself still more gigantic!\\n\\nYes--it was no longer a fossil whose corpse we had raised from the\\nground in the great cemetery, but a giant capable of guiding and driving\\nthese prodigious monsters. His height was above twelve feet. His head,\\nas big as the head of a buffalo, was lost in a mane of matted hair. It\\nwas indeed a huge mane, like those which belonged to the elephants of\\nthe earlier ages of the world.\\n\\nIn his hand was a branch of a tree, which served as a crook for this\\nantediluvian shepherd.\\n\\nWe remained profoundly still, speechless with surprise.\\n\\nBut we might at any moment be seen by him. Nothing remained for us but\\ninstant flight.\\n\\n\"Come, come!\" I cried, dragging my uncle along; and, for the first time,\\nhe made no resistance to my wishes.\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster!\\n\\nNow that I think of the matter calmly, and that I reflect upon it\\ndispassionately; now that months, years, have passed since this strange\\nand unnatural adventure befell us--what am I to think, what am I to\\nbelieve?\\n\\nNo, it is utterly impossible! Our ears must have deceived us, and our\\neyes have cheated us! we have not seen what we believed we had seen. No\\nhuman being could by any possibility have existed in that subterranean\\nworld! No generation of men could inhabit the lower caverns of the globe\\nwithout taking note of those who peopled the surface, without\\ncommunication with them. It was folly, folly, folly! nothing else!\\n\\nI am rather inclined to admit the existence of some animal resembling in\\nstructure the human race--of some monkey of the first geological epochs,\\nlike that discovered by M. Lartet in the ossiferous deposit of Sansan.\\n\\nBut this animal, or being, whichsoever it was, surpassed in height all\\nthings known to modern science. Never mind. However unlikely it may be,\\nit might have been a monkey--but a man, a living man, and with him a\\nwhole generation of gigantic animals, buried in the entrails of the\\nearth--it was too monstrous to be believed!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 37\\n\\nTHE MYSTERIOUS DAGGER\\n\\n\\nDuring this time, we had left the bright and transparent forest far\\nbehind us. We were mute with astonishment, overcome by a kind of feeling\\nwhich was next door to apathy. We kept running in spite of ourselves. It\\nwas a perfect Right, which resembled one of those horrible sensations we\\nsometimes meet with in our dreams.\\n\\nInstinctively we made our way towards the Central Sea, and I cannot now\\ntell what wild thoughts passed through my mind, nor of what follies I\\nmight have been guilty, but for a very serious preoccupation which\\nbrought me back to practical life.\\n\\nThough I was aware that we were treading on a soil quite new to us, I,\\nhowever, every now and then noticed certain aggregations of rock, the\\nshape of which forcibly reminded me of those near Port Gretchen.\\n\\nThis confirmed, moreover, the indications of the compass and our\\nextraordinary and unlooked-for, as well as involuntary, return to the\\nnorth of this great Central Sea. It was so like our starting point, that\\nI could scarcely doubt the reality of our position. Streams and cascades\\nfell in hundreds over the numerous projections of the rocks.\\n\\nI actually thought I could see our faithful and monotonous Hans and the\\nwonderful grotto in which I had come back to life after my tremendous\\nfall.\\n\\nThen, as we advanced still farther, the position of the cliffs, the\\nappearance of a stream, the unexpected profile of a rock, threw me again\\ninto a state of bewildering doubt.\\n\\nAfter some time, I explained my state of mental indecision to my uncle.\\nHe confessed to a similar feeling of hesitation. He was totally unable\\nto make up his mind in the midst of this extraordinary but uniform\\npanorama.\\n\\n\"There can be no doubt,\" I insisted, \"that we have not landed exactly at\\nthe place whence we first took our departure; but the tempest has\\nbrought us above our starting point. I think, therefore, that if we\\nfollow the coast we shall once more find Port Gretchen.\"\\n\\n\"In that case,\" cried my uncle, \"it is useless to continue our\\nexploration. The very best thing we can do is to make our way back to\\nthe raft. Are you quite sure, Harry, that you are not mistaken?\"\\n\\n\"It is difficult,\" was my reply, \"to come to any decision, for all these\\nrocks are exactly alike. There is no marked difference between them. At\\nthe same time, the impression on my mind is that I recognize the\\npromontory at the foot of which our worthy Hans constructed the raft. We\\nare, I am nearly convinced, near the little port: if this be not it,\" I\\nadded, carefully examining a creek which appeared singularly familiar to\\nmy mind.\\n\\n\"My dear Harry--if this were the case, we should find traces of our own\\nfootsteps, some signs of our passage; and I can really see nothing to\\nindicate our having passed this way.\"\\n\\n\"But I see something,\" I cried, in an impetuous tone of voice, as I\\nrushed forward and eagerly picked up something which shone in the sand\\nunder my feet.\\n\\n\"What is it?\" cried the astonished and bewildered Professor.\\n\\n\"This,\" was my reply.\\n\\nAnd I handed to my startled relative a rusty dagger, of singular shape.\\n\\n\"What made you bring with you so useless a weapon?\" he exclaimed. \"It\\nwas needlessly hampering yourself.\"\\n\\n\"I bring it? It is quite new to me. I never saw it before--are you sure\\nit is not out of your collection?\"\\n\\n\"Not that I know of,\" said the Professor, puzzled. \"I have no\\nrecollection of the circumstance. It was never my property.\"\\n\\n\"This is very extraordinary,\" I said, musing over the novel and singular\\nincident.\\n\\n\"Not at all. There is a very simple explanation, Harry. The Icelanders\\nare known to keep up the use of these antiquated weapons, and this must\\nhave belonged to Hans, who has let it fall without knowing it.\"\\n\\nI shook my head. That dagger had never been in the possession of the\\npacific and taciturn Hans. I knew him and his habits too well.\\n\\n\"Then what can it be--unless it be the weapon of some antediluvian\\nwarrior,\" I continued, \"of some living man, a contemporary of that\\nmighty shepherd from whom we have just escaped? But no--mystery upon\\nmystery--this is no weapon of the stony epoch, nor even of the bronze\\nperiod. It is made of excellent steel--\"\\n\\nEre I could finish my sentence, my uncle stopped me short from entering\\nupon a whole train of theories, and spoke in his most cold and decided\\ntone of voice.\\n\\n\"Calm yourself, my dear boy, and endeavor to use your reason. This\\nweapon, upon which we have fallen so unexpectedly, is a true <i>dague</i>,\\none of those worn by gentlemen in their belts during the sixteenth\\ncentury. Its use was to give the <i>coup de grace</i>, the final blow, to the\\nfoe who would not surrender. It is clearly of Spanish workmanship. It\\nbelongs neither to you, nor to me, nor the eider-down hunter, nor to any\\nof the living beings who may still exist so marvelously in the interior\\nof the earth.\"\\n\\n\"What can you mean, Uncle?\" I said, now lost in a host of surmises.\\n\\n\"Look closely at it,\" he continued; \"these jagged edges were never made\\nby the resistance of human blood and bone. The blade is covered with a\\nregular coating of iron mold and rust, which is not a day old, not a\\nyear old, not a century old, but much more--\"\\n\\nThe Professor began to get quite excited, according to custom, and was\\nallowing himself to be carried away by his fertile imagination. I could\\nhave said something. He stopped me.\\n\\n\"Harry,\" he cried, \"we are now on the verge of a great discovery. This\\nblade of a dagger you have so marvelously discovered, after being\\nabandoned upon the sand for more than a hundred, two hundred, even three\\nhundred years, has been indented by someone endeavoring to carve an\\ninscription on these rocks.\"\\n\\n\"But this poniard never got here of itself,\" I exclaimed, \"it could not\\nhave twisted itself. Someone, therefore, must have preceded us upon the\\nshores of this extraordinary sea.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, a man.\"\\n\\n\"But what man has been sufficiently desperate to do such a thing?\"\\n\\n\"A man who has somewhere written his name with this very dagger--a man\\nwho has endeavored once more to indicate the right road to the interior\\nof the earth. Let us look around, my boy. You know not the importance of\\nyour singular and happy discovery.\"\\n\\nProdigiously interested, we walked along the wall of rock, examining the\\nsmallest fissures, which might finally expand into the much wished--for\\ngully or shaft.\\n\\nWe at last reached a spot where the shore became extremely narrow. The\\nsea almost bathed the foot of the rocks, which were here very lofty and\\nsteep. There was scarcely a path wider than two yards at any point. At\\nlast, under a huge over-hanging rock, we discovered the entrance of a\\ndark and gloomy tunnel.\\n\\nThere, on a square tablet of granite, which had been smoothed by rubbing\\nit with another stone, we could see two mysterious, and much worn\\nletters, the two initials of the bold and extraordinary traveler who had\\npreceded us on our adventurous journey.\\n\\n[Illustration: Runic Glyph]\\n\\n\"A. S.!\" cried my uncle. \"You see, I was right. Arne Saknussemm, always\\nArne Saknussemm!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 38\\n\\nNO OUTLET--BLASTING THE ROCK\\n\\n\\nEver since the commencement of our marvelous journey, I had experienced\\nmany surprises, had suffered from many illusions. I thought that I was\\ncase-hardened against all surprises and could neither see nor hear\\nanything to amaze me again.\\n\\nI was like a many who, having been round the world, finds himself wholly\\nblase and proof against the marvelous.\\n\\nWhen, however, I saw these two letters, which had been engraven three\\nhundred years before, I stood fixed in an attitude of mute surprise.\\n\\nNot only was there the signature of the learned and enterprising\\nalchemist written in the rock, but I held in my hand the very identical\\ninstrument with which he had laboriously engraved it.\\n\\nIt was impossible, without showing an amount of incredulity scarcely\\nbecoming a sane man, to deny the existence of the traveler, and the\\nreality of that voyage which I believed all along to have been a\\nmyth--the mystification of some fertile brain.\\n\\nWhile these reflections were passing through my mind, my uncle, the\\nProfessor, gave way to an access of feverish and poetical excitement.\\n\\n\"Wonderful and glorious genius, great Saknussemm,\" he cried, \"you have\\nleft no stone unturned, no resource omitted, to show to other mortals\\nthe way into the interior of our mighty globe, and your fellow creatures\\ncan find the trail left by your illustrious footsteps, three hundred\\nyears ago, at the bottom of these obscure subterranean abodes. You have\\nbeen careful to secure for others the contemplation of these wonders and\\nmarvels of creation. Your name engraved at every important stage of your\\nglorious journey leads the hopeful traveler direct to the great and\\nmighty discovery to which you devoted such energy and courage. The\\naudacious traveler, who shall follow your footsteps to the last, will\\ndoubtless find your initials engraved with your own hand upon the centre\\nof the earth. I will be that audacious traveler--I, too, will sign my\\nname upon the very same spot, upon the central granite stone of this\\nwondrous work of the Creator. But in justice to your devotion, to your\\ncourage, and to your being the first to indicate the road, let this\\ncape, seen by you upon the shores of this sea discovered by you, be\\ncalled, of all time, Cape Saknussemm.\"\\n\\nThis is what I heard, and I began to be roused to the pitch of\\nenthusiasm indicated by those words. A fierce excitement roused me. I\\nforgot everything. The dangers of the voyage and the perils of the\\nreturn journey were now as nothing!\\n\\nWhat another man had done in ages past could, I felt, be done again; I\\nwas determined to do it myself, and now nothing that man had\\naccomplished appeared to me impossible.\\n\\n\"Forward--forward,\" I cried in a burst of genuine and hearty enthusiasm.\\n\\nI had already started in the direction of the somber and gloomy gallery\\nwhen the Professor stopped me; he, the man so rash and hasty, he, the\\nman so easily roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm, checked me, and\\nasked me to be patient and show more calm.\\n\\n\"Let us return to our good friend, Hans,\" he said; \"we will then bring\\nthe raft down to this place.\"\\n\\nI must say that though I at once yielded to my uncle\\'s request, it was\\nnot without dissatisfaction, and I hastened along the rocks of that\\nwonderful coast.\\n\\n\"Do you know, my dear uncle,\" I said, as we walked along, \"that we have\\nbeen singularly helped by a concurrence of circumstances, right up to\\nthis very moment.\"\\n\\n\"So you begin to see it, do you, Harry?\" said the Professor with a\\nsmile.\\n\\n\"Doubtless,\" I responded, \"and strangely enough, even the tempest has\\nbeen the means of putting us on the right road. Blessings on the\\ntempest! It brought us safely back to the very spot from which fine\\nweather would have driven us forever. Supposing we had succeeded in\\nreaching the southern and distant shores of this extraordinary sea, what\\nwould have become of us? The name of Saknussemm would never have\\nappeared to us, and at this moment we should have been cast away upon an\\ninhospitable coast, probably without an outlet.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Harry, my boy, there is certainly something providential in that\\nwandering at the mercy of wind and waves towards the south: we have come\\nback exactly north; and what is better still, we fall upon this great\\ndiscovery of Cape Saknussemm. I mean to say, that it is more than\\nsurprising; there is something in it which is far beyond my\\ncomprehension. The coincidence is unheard of, marvelous!\"\\n\\n\"What matter! It is not our duty to explain facts, but to make the best\\npossible use of them.\"\\n\\n\"Doubtless, my boy; but if you will allow me--\" said the really\\ndelighted Professor.\\n\\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I see exactly how it will be; we shall take the\\nnorthern route; we shall pass under the northern regions of Europe,\\nunder Sweden, under Russia, under Siberia, and who knows where--instead\\nof burying ourselves under the burning plains and deserts of Africa, or\\nbeneath the mighty waves of the ocean; and that is all, at this stage of\\nour journey, that I care to know. Let us advance, and Heaven will be our\\nguide!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Harry, you are right, quite right; all is for the best. Let us\\nabandon this horizontal sea, which could never have led to anything\\nsatisfactory. We shall descend, descend, and everlastingly descend. Do\\nyou know, my dear boy, that to reach the interior of the earth we have\\nonly five thousand miles to travel!\"\\n\\n\"Bah!\" I cried, carried away by a burst of enthusiasm, \"the distance is\\nscarcely worth speaking about. The thing is to make a start.\"\\n\\nMy wild, mad, and incoherent speeches continued until we rejoined our\\npatient and phlegmatic guide. All was, we found, prepared for an\\nimmediate departure. There was not a single parcel but what was in its\\nproper place. We all took up our posts on the raft, and the sail being\\nhoisted, Hans received his directions, and guided the frail bark towards\\nCape Saknussemm, as we had definitely named it.\\n\\nThe wind was very unfavorable to a craft that was unable to sail close\\nto the wind. It was constructed to go before the blast. We were\\ncontinually reduced to pushing ourselves forward by means of poles. On\\nseveral occasions the rocks ran far out into deep water and we were\\ncompelled to make a long round. At last, after three long and weary\\nhours of navigation, that is to say, about six o\\'clock in the evening,\\nwe found a place at which we could land.\\n\\nI jumped on shore first. In my present state of excitement and\\nenthusiasm, I was always first. My uncle and the Icelander followed. The\\nvoyage from the port to this point of the sea had by no means calmed me.\\nIt had rather produced the opposite effect. I even proposed to burn our\\nvessel, that is, to destroy our raft, in order to completely cut off our\\nretreat. But my uncle sternly opposed this wild project. I began to\\nthink him particularly lukewarm and unenthusiastic.\\n\\n\"At any rate, my dear uncle,\" I said, \"let us start without delay.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my boy, I am quite as eager to do so as you can be. But, in the\\nfirst place, let us examine this mysterious gallery, in order to find if\\nwe shall need to prepare and mend our ladders.\"\\n\\nMy uncle now began to see to the efficiency of our Ruhmkorff coil, which\\nwould doubtless soon be needed; the raft, securely fastened to a rock,\\nwas left alone. Moreover, the opening into the new gallery was not\\ntwenty paces distant from the spot. Our little troop, with myself at the\\nhead, advanced.\\n\\nThe orifice, which was almost circular, presented a diameter of about\\nfive feet; the somber tunnel was cut in the living rock, and coated on\\nthe inside by the different material which had once passed through it in\\na state of fusion. The lower part was about level with the water, so\\nthat we were able to penetrate to the interior without difficulty.\\n\\nWe followed an almost horizontal direction; when, at the end of about a\\ndozen paces, our further advance was checked by the interposition of an\\nenormous block of granite rock.\\n\\n\"Accursed stone!\" I cried furiously, on perceiving that we were stopped\\nby what seemed an insurmountable obstacle.\\n\\nIn vain we looked to the right, in vain we looked to the left; in vain\\nexamined it above and below. There existed no passage, no sign of any\\nother tunnel. I experienced the most bitter and painful disappointment.\\nSo enraged was I that I would not admit the reality of any obstacle. I\\nstooped to my knees; I looked under the mass of stone. No hole, no\\ninterstice. I then looked above. The same barrier of granite! Hans, with\\nthe lamp, examined the sides of the tunnel in every direction.\\n\\nBut all in vain! It was necessary to renounce all hope of passing\\nthrough.\\n\\nI had seated myself upon the ground. My uncle walked angrily and\\nhopelessly up and down. He was evidently desperate.\\n\\n\"But,\" I cried, after some moments\\' thought, \"what about Arne\\nSaknussemm?\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" replied my uncle, \"he can never have been checked by a\\nlump of rock.\"\\n\\n\"No--ten thousand times no,\" I cried, with extreme vivacity. \"This huge\\nlump of rock, in consequence of some singular concussion, or process,\\none of those magnetic phenomena which have so often shaken the\\nterrestrial crust, has in some unexpected way closed up the passage.\\nMany and many years have passed away since the return of Saknussemm, and\\nthe fall of this huge block of granite. Is it not quite evident that\\nthis gallery was formerly the outlet for the pent-up lava in the\\ninterior of the earth, and that these eruptive matters then circulated\\nfreely? Look at these recent fissures in the granite roof; it is\\nevidently formed of pieces of enormous stone, placed here as if by the\\nhand of a giant, who had worked to make a strong and substantial arch.\\nOne day, after an unusually strong shock, the vast rock which stands in\\nour way, and which was doubtless the key of a kind of arch, fell through\\nto a level with the soil and has barred our further progress. We are\\nright, then, in thinking that this is an unexpected obstacle, with which\\nSaknussemm did not meet; and if we do not upset it in some way, we are\\nunworthy of following in the footsteps of the great discoverer; and\\nincapable of finding our way to the centre of the earth!\"\\n\\nIn this wild way I addressed my uncle. The zeal of the Professor, his\\nearnest longing for success, had become part and parcel of my being. I\\nwholly forgot the past; I utterly despised the future. Nothing existed\\nfor me upon the surface of this spheroid in the bosom of which I was\\nengulfed, no towns, no country, no Hamburg, no Koenigstrasse, not even\\nmy poor Gretchen, who by this time would believe me utterly lost in the\\ninterior of the earth!\\n\\n\"Well,\" cried my uncle, roused to enthusiasm by my words, \"Let us go to\\nwork with pickaxes, with crowbars, with anything that comes to hand--but\\ndown with these terrible walls.\"\\n\\n\"It is far too tough and too big to be destroyed by a pickax or\\ncrowbar,\" I replied.\\n\\n\"What then?\"\\n\\n\"As I said, it is useless to think of overcoming such a difficulty by\\nmeans of ordinary tools.\"\\n\\n\"What then?\"\\n\\n\"What else but gunpowder, a subterranean mine? Let us blow up the\\nobstacle that stands in our way.\"\\n\\n\"Gunpowder!\"\\n\\n\"Yes; all we have to do is to get rid of this paltry obstacle.\"\\n\\n\"To work, Hans, to work!\" cried the Professor.\\n\\nThe Icelander went back to the raft, and soon returned with a huge\\ncrowbar, with which he began to dig a hole in the rock, which was to\\nserve as a mine. It was by no means a slight task. It was necessary for\\nour purpose to make a cavity large enough to hold fifty pounds of\\nfulminating gun cotton, the expansive power of which is four times as\\ngreat as that of ordinary gunpowder.\\n\\nI had now roused myself to an almost miraculous state of excitement.\\nWhile Hans was at work, I actively assisted my uncle to prepare a long\\nwick, made from damp gunpowder, the mass of which we finally enclosed in\\na bag of linen.\\n\\n\"We are bound to go through,\" I cried, enthusiastically.\\n\\n\"We are bound to go through,\" responded the Professor, tapping me on the\\nback.\\n\\nAt midnight, our work as miners was completely finished; the charge of\\nfulminating cotton was thrust into the hollow, and the match, which we\\nhad made of considerable length, was ready.\\n\\nA spark was now sufficient to ignite this formidable engine, and to blow\\nthe rock to atoms!\\n\\n\"We will now rest until tomorrow.\"\\n\\nIt was absolutely necessary to resign myself to my fate, and to consent\\nto wait for the explosion for six weary hours!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 39\\n\\nTHE EXPLOSION AND ITS RESULTS\\n\\n\\nThe next day, which was the twenty-seventh of August, was a date\\ncelebrated in our wondrous subterranean journey. I never think of it\\neven now, but I shudder with horror. My heart beats wildly at the very\\nmemory of that awful day.\\n\\nFrom this time forward, our reason, our judgment, our human ingenuity,\\nhave nothing to do with the course of events. We are about to become the\\nplaything of the great phenomena of the earth!\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock we were all up and ready. The dreaded moment was arriving\\nwhen we were about to seek an opening into the interior of the earth by\\nmeans of gunpowder. What would be the consequences of breaking through\\nthe crust of the earth?\\n\\nI begged that it might be my duty to set fire to the mine. I looked upon\\nit as an honor. This task once performed, I could rejoin my friends upon\\nthe raft, which had not been unloaded. As soon as we were all ready, we\\nwere to sail away to some distance to avoid the consequences of the\\nexplosion, the effects of which would certainly not be concentrated in\\nthe interior of the earth.\\n\\nThe slow match we calculated to burn for about ten minutes, more or\\nless, before it reached the chamber in which the great body of powder\\nwas confined. I should therefore have plenty of time to reach the raft\\nand put off to a safe distance.\\n\\nI prepared to execute my self-allotted task--not, it must be confessed,\\nwithout considerable emotion.\\n\\nAfter a hearty repast, my uncle and the hunter-guide embarked on board\\nthe raft, while I remained alone upon the desolate shore.\\n\\nI was provided with a lantern which was to enable me to set fire to the\\nwick of the infernal machine.\\n\\n\"Go, my boy,\" said my uncle, \"and Heaven be with you. But come back as\\nsoon as you can. I shall be all impatience.\"\\n\\n\"Be easy on that matter,\" I replied, \"there is no fear of my delaying on\\nthe road.\"\\n\\nHaving said this, I advanced toward the opening of the somber gallery.\\nMy heart beat wildly. I opened my lantern and seized the extremity of\\nthe wick.\\n\\nThe Professor, who was looking on, held his chronometer in his hand.\\n\\n\"Are you ready?\" cried he.\\n\\n\"Quite ready.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then, fire away!\"\\n\\nI hastened to put the light to the wick, which crackled and sparkled,\\nhissing and spitting like a serpent; then, running as fast as I could, I\\nreturned to the shore.\\n\\n\"Get on board, my lad, and you, Hans, shove off,\" cried my uncle.\\n\\nBy a vigorous application of his pole Hans sent us flying over the\\nwater. The raft was quite twenty fathoms distant.\\n\\nIt was a moment of palpitating interest, of deep anxiety. My uncle, the\\nProfessor, never took his eyes off the chronometer.\\n\\n\"Only five minutes more,\" he said in a low tone, \"only four, only\\nthree.\"\\n\\nMy pulse went a hundred to the minute. I could hear my heart beating.\\n\\n\"Only two, one! Now, then, mountains of granite, crumble beneath the\\npower of man!\"\\n\\nWhat happened after that? As to the terrific roar of the explosion, I do\\nnot think I heard it. But the form of the rocks completely changed in my\\neyes--they seemed to be drawn aside like a curtain. I saw a fathomless,\\na bottomless abyss, which yawned beneath the turgid waves. The sea,\\nwhich seemed suddenly to have gone mad, then became one great\\nmountainous mass, upon the top of which the raft rose perpendicularly.\\n\\nWe were all thrown down. In less than a second the light gave place to\\nthe most profound obscurity. Then I felt all solid support give way not\\nto my feet, but to the raft itself. I thought it was going bodily down a\\ntremendous well. I tried to speak, to question my uncle. Nothing could\\nbe heard but the roaring of the mighty waves. We clung together in utter\\nsilence.\\n\\nDespite the awful darkness, despite the noise, the surprise, the\\nemotion, I thoroughly understood what had happened.\\n\\nBeyond the rock which had been blown up, there existed a mighty abyss.\\nThe explosion had caused a kind of earthquake in this soil, broken by\\nfissures and rents. The gulf, thus suddenly thrown open, was about to\\nswallow the inland sea which, transformed into a mighty torrent, was\\ndragging us with it.\\n\\nOnly one idea filled my mind. We were utterly and completely lost!\\n\\nOne hour, two hours--what more I cannot say, passed in this manner. We\\nsat close together, elbow touching elbow, knee touching knee! We held\\none another\\'s hands not to be thrown off the raft. We were subjected to\\nthe most violent shocks, whenever our sole dependence, a frail wooden\\nraft, struck against the rocky sides of the channel. Fortunately for us,\\nthese concussions became less and less frequent, which made me fancy\\nthat the gallery was getting wider and wider. There could be now no\\ndoubt that we had chanced upon the road once followed by Saknussemm, but\\ninstead of going down in a proper manner, we had, through our own\\nimprudence, drawn a whole sea with us!\\n\\nThese ideas presented themselves to my mind in a very vague and obscure\\nmanner. I felt rather than reasoned. I put my ideas together only\\nconfusedly, while spinning along like a man going down a waterfall. To\\njudge by the air which, as it were, whipped my face, we must have been\\nrushing at a perfectly lightning rate.\\n\\nTo attempt under these circumstances to light a torch was simply\\nimpossible, and the last remains of our electric machine, of our\\nRuhmkorff coil, had been destroyed during the fearful explosion.\\n\\nI was therefore very much confused to see at last a bright light shining\\nclose to me. The calm countenance of the guide seemed to gleam upon me.\\nThe clever and patient hunter had succeeded in lighting the lantern; and\\nthough, in the keen and thorough draft, the flame flickered and\\nvacillated and was nearly put out, it served partially to dissipate the\\nawful obscurity.\\n\\nThe gallery into which we had entered was very wide. I was, therefore,\\nquite right in that part of my conjecture. The insufficient light did\\nnot allow us to see both of the walls at the same time. The slope of\\nwaters, which was carrying us away, was far greater than that of the\\nmost rapid river of America. The whole surface of the stream seemed to\\nbe composed of liquid arrows, darted forward with extreme violence and\\npower. I can give no idea of the impression it made upon me.\\n\\nThe raft, at times, caught in certain whirlpools, and rushed forward,\\nyet turned on itself all the time. How it did not upset I shall never be\\nable to understand. When it approached the sides of the gallery, I took\\ncare to throw upon them the light of the lantern, and I was able to\\njudge of the rapidity of motion by looking at the projecting masses of\\nrock, which as soon as seen were again invisible. So rapid was our\\nprogress that points of rock at a considerable distance one from the\\nother appeared like portions of transverse lines, which enclosed us in a\\nkind of net, like that of a line of telegraphic wires.\\n\\nI believe we were now going at a rate of not less than a hundred miles\\nan hour.\\n\\nMy uncle and I looked at one another with wild and haggard eyes; we\\nclung convulsively to the stump of the mast, which, at the moment when\\nthe catastrophe took place, had snapped short off. We turned our backs\\nas much as possible to the wind, in order not to be stifled by a\\nrapidity of motion which nothing human could face and live.\\n\\nAnd still the long monotonous hours went on. The situation did not\\nchange in the least, though a discovery I suddenly made seemed to\\ncomplicate it very much.\\n\\nWhen we had slightly recovered our equilibrium, I proceeded to examine\\nour cargo. I then made the unsatisfactory discovery that the greater\\npart of it had utterly disappeared.\\n\\nI became alarmed, and determined to discover what were our resources. My\\nheart beat at the idea, but it was absolutely necessary to know on what\\nwe had to depend. With this view, I took the lantern and looked around.\\n\\nOf all our former collection of nautical and philosophical instruments,\\nthere remained only the chronometer and the compass. The ladders and\\nropes were reduced to a small piece of rope fastened to the stump of the\\nmast. Not a pickax, not a crowbar, not a hammer, and, far worse than\\nall, no food--not enough for one day!\\n\\nThis discovery was a prelude to a certain and horrible death.\\n\\nSeated gloomily on the raft, clasping the stump of the mast\\nmechanically, I thought of all I had read as to sufferings from\\nstarvation.\\n\\nI remembered everything that history had taught me on the subject, and I\\nshuddered at the remembrance of the agonies to be endured.\\n\\nMaddened at the prospects of enduring the miseries of starvation, I\\npersuaded myself that I must be mistaken. I examined the cracks in the\\nraft; I poked between the joints and beams; I examined every possible\\nhole and corner. The result was--simply nothing!\\n\\nOur stock of provisions consisted of nothing but a piece of dry meat and\\nsome soaked and half-moldy biscuits.\\n\\nI gazed around me scared and frightened. I could not understand the\\nawful truth. And yet of what consequence was it in regard to any new\\ndanger? Supposing that we had had provisions for months, and even for\\nyears, how could we ever get out of the awful abyss into which we were\\nbeing hurled by the irresistible torrent we had let loose?\\n\\nWhy should we trouble ourselves about the sufferings and tortures to be\\nendured from hunger when death stared us in the face under so many other\\nswifter and perhaps even more horrid forms?\\n\\nIt was very doubtful, under the circumstances in which we were placed,\\nif we should have time to die of inanition.\\n\\nBut the human frame is singularly constituted.\\n\\nI know not how it was; but, from some singular hallucination of the\\nmind, I forgot the real, serious, and immediate danger to which we were\\nexposed, to think of the menaces of the future, which appeared before us\\nin all their naked terror. Besides, after all, suggested Hope, perhaps\\nwe might finally escape the fury of the raging torrent, and once more\\nrevisit the glimpses of the moon, on the surface of our beautiful Mother\\nEarth.\\n\\nHow was it to be done? I had not the remotest idea. Where were we to\\ncome out? No matter, so that we did.\\n\\nOne chance in a thousand is always a chance, while death from hunger\\ngave us not even the faintest glimpse of hope. It left to the\\nimagination nothing but blank horror, without the faintest chance of\\nescape!\\n\\nI had the greatest mind to reveal all to my uncle, to explain to him the\\nextraordinary and wretched position to which we were reduced, in order\\nthat, between the two, we might make a calculation as to the exact space\\nof time which remained for us to live.\\n\\nIt was, it appeared to me, the only thing to be done. But I had the\\ncourage to hold my tongue, to gnaw at my entrails like the Spartan boy.\\nI wished to leave him all his coolness.\\n\\nAt this moment, the light of the lantern slowly fell, and at last went\\nout!\\n\\nThe wick had wholly burnt to an end. The obscurity became absolute. It\\nwas no longer possible to see through the impenetrable darkness! There\\nwas one torch left, but it was impossible to keep it alight. Then, like\\na child, I shut my eyes, that I might not see the darkness.\\n\\nAfter a great lapse of time, the rapidity of our journey increased. I\\ncould feel it by the rush of air upon my face. The slope of the waters\\nwas excessive. I began to feel that we were no longer going down a\\nslope; we were falling. I felt as one does in a dream, going down\\nbodily--falling; falling; falling!\\n\\nI felt that the hands of my uncle and Hans were vigorously clasping my\\narms.\\n\\nSuddenly, after a lapse of time scarcely appreciable, I felt something\\nlike a shock. The raft had not struck a hard body, but had suddenly been\\nchecked in its course. A waterspout, a liquid column of water, fell upon\\nus. I felt suffocating. I was being drowned.\\n\\nStill the sudden inundation did not last. In a few seconds I felt myself\\nonce more able to breathe. My uncle and Hans pressed my arms, and the\\nraft carried us all three away.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 40\\n\\nTHE APE GIGANS\\n\\n\\nIt is difficult for me to determine what was the real time, but I should\\nsuppose, by after calculation, that it must have been ten at night.\\n\\nI lay in a stupor, a half dream, during which I saw visions of\\nastounding character. Monsters of the deep were side by side with the\\nmighty elephantine shepherd. Gigantic fish and animals seemed to form\\nstrange conjunctions.\\n\\nThe raft took a sudden turn, whirled round, entered another tunnel--this\\ntime illumined in a most singular manner. The roof was formed of porous\\nstalactite, through which a moonlit vapor appeared to pass, casting its\\nbrilliant light upon our gaunt and haggard figures. The light increased\\nas we advanced, while the roof ascended; until at last, we were once\\nmore in a kind of water cavern, the lofty dome of which disappeared in a\\nluminous cloud!\\n\\nA rugged cavern of small extent appeared to offer a halting place to our\\nweary bodies.\\n\\nMy uncle and the guide moved as men in a dream. I was afraid to waken\\nthem, knowing the danger of such a sudden start. I seated myself beside\\nthem to watch.\\n\\nAs I did so, I became aware of something moving in the distance, which\\nat once fascinated my eyes. It was floating, apparently, upon the\\nsurface of the water, advancing by means of what at first appeared\\npaddles. I looked with glaring eyes. One glance told me that it was\\nsomething monstrous.\\n\\nBut what?\\n\\nIt was the great \"shark-crocodile\" of the early writers on geology.\\nAbout the size of an ordinary whale, with hideous jaws and two gigantic\\neyes, it advanced. Its eyes fixed on me with terrible sternness. Some\\nindefinite warning told me that it had marked me for its own.\\n\\nI attempted to rise--to escape, no matter where, but my knees shook\\nunder me; my limbs trembled violently; I almost lost my senses. And\\nstill the mighty monster advanced. My uncle and the guide made no effort\\nto save themselves.\\n\\nWith a strange noise, like none other I had ever heard, the beast came\\non. His jaws were at least seven feet apart, and his distended mouth\\nlooked large enough to have swallowed a boatful of men.\\n\\nWe were about ten feet distant when I discovered that much as his body\\nresembled that of a crocodile, his mouth was wholly that of a shark.\\n\\nHis twofold nature now became apparent. To snatch us up at a mouthful it\\nwas necessary for him to turn on his back, which motion necessarily\\ncaused his legs to kick up helplessly in the air.\\n\\nI actually laughed even in the very jaws of death!\\n\\nBut next minute, with a wild cry, I darted away into the interior of the\\ncave, leaving my unhappy comrades to their fate! This cavern was deep\\nand dreary. After about a hundred yards, I paused and looked around.\\n\\nThe whole floor, composed of sand and malachite, was strewn with bones,\\nfreshly gnawed bones of reptiles and fish, with a mixture of mammalia.\\nMy very soul grew sick as my body shuddered with horror. I had truly,\\naccording to the old proverb, fallen out of the frying pan into the\\nfire. Some beast larger and more ferocious even than the shark-crocodile\\ninhabited this den.\\n\\nWhat could I do? The mouth of the cave was guarded by one ferocious\\nmonster, the interior was inhabited by something too hideous to\\ncontemplate. Flight was impossible!\\n\\nOnly one resource remained, and that was to find some small hiding place\\nto which the fearful denizens of the cavern could not penetrate. I gazed\\nwildly around, and at last discovered a fissure in the rock, to which I\\nrushed in the hope of recovering my scattered senses.\\n\\nCrouching down, I waited shivering as in an ague fit. No man is brave in\\npresence of an earthquake, or a bursting boiler, or an exploding\\ntorpedo. I could not be expected to feel much courage in presence of the\\nfearful fate that appeared to await me.\\n\\nAn hour passed. I heard all the time a strange rumbling outside the\\ncave.\\n\\nWhat was the fate of my unhappy companions? It was impossible for me to\\npause to inquire. My own wretched existence was all I could think of.\\n\\nSuddenly a groaning, as of fifty bears in a fight, fell upon my\\nears--hisses, spitting, moaning, hideous to hear--and then I saw--\\n\\nNever, were ages to pass over my head, shall I forget the horrible\\napparition.\\n\\nIt was the Ape Gigans!\\n\\nFourteen feet high, covered with coarse hair, of a blackish brown, the\\nhair on the arms, from the shoulder to the elbow joints, pointing\\ndownwards, while that from the wrist to the elbow pointed upwards, it\\nadvanced. Its arms were as long as its body, while its legs were\\nprodigious. It had thick, long, and sharply pointed teeth--like a\\nmammoth saw.\\n\\nIt struck its breast as it came on smelling and sniffing, reminding me\\nof the stories we read in our early childhood of giants who ate the\\nFlesh of men and little boys!\\n\\nSuddenly it stopped. My heart beat wildly, for I was conscious that,\\nsomehow or other, the fearful monster had smelled me out and was peering\\nabout with his hideous eyes to try and discover my whereabouts.\\n\\nMy reading, which as a rule is a blessing, but which on this occasion,\\nseemed momentarily to prove a curse, told me the real truth. It was the\\nApe Gigans, the antediluvian gorilla.\\n\\nYes! This awful monster, confined by good fortune to the interior of the\\nearth, was the progenitor of the hideous monster of Africa.\\n\\nHe glared wildly about, seeking something--doubtless myself. I gave\\nmyself up for lost. No hope of safety or escape seemed to remain.\\n\\nAt this moment, just as my eyes appeared to close in death, there came a\\nstrange noise from the entrance of the cave; and turning, the gorilla\\nevidently recognized some enemy more worthy his prodigious size and\\nstrength. It was the huge shark-crocodile, which perhaps having disposed\\nof my friends, was coming in search of further prey.\\n\\nThe gorilla placed himself on the defensive, and clutching a bone some\\nseven or eight feet in length, a perfect club, aimed a deadly blow at\\nthe hideous beast, which reared upwards and fell with all its weight\\nupon its adversary.\\n\\nA terrible combat, the details of which it is impossible to give, now\\nensued. The struggle was awful and ferocious, I, however, did not wait\\nto witness the result. Regarding myself as the object of contention, I\\ndetermined to remove from the presence of the victor. I slid down from\\nmy hiding place, reached the ground, and gliding against the wall,\\nstrove to gain the open mouth of the cavern.\\n\\nBut I had not taken many steps when the fearful clamor ceased, to be\\nfollowed by a mumbling and groaning which appeared to be indicative of\\nvictory.\\n\\nI looked back and saw the huge ape, gory with blood, coming after me\\nwith glaring eyes, with dilated nostrils that gave forth two columns of\\nheated vapor. I could feel his hot and fetid breath on my neck; and with\\na horrid jump--awoke from my nightmare sleep.\\n\\nYes--it was all a dream. I was still on the raft with my uncle and the\\nguide.\\n\\nThe relief was not instantaneous, for under the influence of the hideous\\nnightmare my senses had become numbed. After a while, however, my\\nfeelings were tranquilized. The first of my perceptions which returned\\nin full force was that of hearing. I listened with acute and attentive\\nears. All was still as death. All I comprehended was silence. To the\\nroaring of the waters, which had filled the gallery with awful\\nreverberations, succeeded perfect peace.\\n\\nAfter some little time my uncle spoke, in a low and scarcely audible\\ntone: \"Harry, boy, where are you?\"\\n\\n\"I am here,\" was my faint rejoinder.\\n\\n\"Well, don\\'t you see what has happened? We are going upwards.\"\\n\\n\"My dear uncle, what can you mean?\" was my half-delirious reply.\\n\\n\"Yes, I tell you we are ascending rapidly. Our downward journey is quite\\nchecked.\"\\n\\nI held out my hand, and, after some little difficulty, succeeded in\\ntouching the wall. My hand was in an instant covered with blood. The\\nskin was torn from the flesh. We were ascending with extraordinary\\nrapidity.\\n\\n\"The torch--the torch!\" cried the Professor, wildly; \"it must be\\nlighted.\"\\n\\nHans, the guide, after many vain efforts, at last succeeded in lighting\\nit, and the flame, having now nothing to prevent its burning, shed a\\ntolerably clear light. We were enabled to form an approximate idea of\\nthe truth.\\n\\n\"It is just as I thought,\" said my uncle, after a moment or two of\\nsilent attention. \"We are in a narrow well about four fathoms square.\\nThe waters of the great inland sea, having reached the bottom of the\\ngulf are now forcing themselves up the mighty shaft. As a natural\\nconsequence, we are being cast upon the summit of the waters.\"\\n\\n\"That I can see,\" was my lugubrious reply; \"but where will this shaft\\nend, and to what fall are we likely to be exposed?\"\\n\\n\"Of that I am as ignorant as yourself. All I know is, that we should be\\nprepared for the worst. We are going up at a fearfully rapid rate. As\\nfar as I can judge, we are ascending at the rate of two fathoms a\\nsecond, of a hundred and twenty fathoms a minute, or rather more than\\nthree and a half leagues an hour. At this rate, our fate will soon be a\\nmatter of certainty.\"\\n\\n\"No doubt of it,\" was my reply. \"The great concern I have now, however,\\nis to know whether this shaft has any issue. It may end in a granite\\nroof--in which case we shall be suffocated by compressed air, or dashed\\nto atoms against the top. I fancy, already, that the air is beginning to\\nbe close and condensed. I have a difficulty in breathing.\"\\n\\nThis might be fancy, or it might be the effect of our rapid motion, but\\nI certainly felt a great oppression of the chest.\\n\\n\"Henry,\" said the Professor, \"I do believe that the situation is to a\\ncertain extent desperate. There remain, however, many chances of\\nultimate safety, and I have, in my own mind, been revolving them over,\\nduring your heavy but agitated sleep. I have come to this logical\\nconclusion--whereas we may at any moment perish, so at any moment we may\\nbe saved! We need, therefore, prepare ourselves for whatever may turn up\\nin the great chapter of accidents.\"\\n\\n\"But what would you have us do?\" I cried. \"Are we not utterly helpless?\"\\n\\n\"No! While there is life there is hope. At all events, there is one\\nthing we can do--eat, and thus obtain strength to face victory or\\ndeath.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke, I looked at my uncle with a haggard glance. I had put off\\nthe fatal communication as long as possible. It was now forced upon me,\\nand I must tell him the truth.\\n\\nStill I hesitated.\\n\\n\"Eat,\" I said, in a deprecating tone as if there were no hurry.\\n\\n\"Yes, and at once. I feel like a starving prisoner,\" he said, rubbing\\nhis yellow and shivering hands together.\\n\\nAnd, turning round to the guide, he spoke some hearty, cheering words,\\nas I judged from his tone, in Danish. Hans shook his head in a terribly\\nsignificant manner. I tried to look unconcerned.\\n\\n\"What!\" cried the Professor, \"you do not mean to say that all our\\nprovisions are lost?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" was my lowly spoken reply, as I held out something in my hand,\\n\"this morsel of dried meat is all that remains for us three.\"\\n\\nMy uncle gazed at me as if he could not fully appreciate the meaning of\\nmy words. The blow seemed to stun him by its severity. I allowed him to\\nreflect for some moments.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said I, after a short pause, \"what do you think now? Is there\\nany chance of our escaping from our horrible subterranean dangers? Are\\nwe not doomed to perish in the great hollows of the centre of the\\nearth?\"\\n\\nBut my pertinent questions brought no answer. My uncle either heard me\\nnot, or appeared not to do so.\\n\\nAnd in this way a whole hour passed. Neither of us cared to speak. For\\nmyself, I began to feel the most fearful and devouring hunger. My\\ncompanions, doubtless, felt the same horrible tortures, but neither of\\nthem would touch the wretched morsel of meat that remained. It lay\\nthere, a last remnant of all our great preparations for the mad and\\nsenseless journey!\\n\\nI looked back, with wonderment, to my own folly. Fully was I aware that,\\ndespite his enthusiasm, and the ever-to-be-hated scroll of Saknussemm,\\nmy uncle should never have started on his perilous voyage. What memories\\nof the happy past, what previsions of the horrible future, now filled my\\nbrain!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 41\\n\\nHUNGER\\n\\n\\nHunger, prolonged, is temporary madness! The brain is at work without\\nits required food, and the most fantastic notions fill the mind.\\nHitherto I had never known what hunger really meant. I was likely to\\nunderstand it now.\\n\\nAnd yet, three months before I could tell my terrible story of\\nstarvation, as I thought it. As a boy I used to make frequent excursions\\nin the neighborhood of the Professor\\'s house.\\n\\nMy uncle always acted on system, and he believed that, in addition to\\nthe day of rest and worship, there should be a day of recreation. In\\nconsequence, I was always free to do as I liked on a Wednesday.\\n\\nNow, as I had a notion to combine the useful and the agreeable, my\\nfavorite pastime was birds\\' nesting. I had one of the best collections\\nof eggs in all the town. They were classified, and under glass cases.\\n\\nThere was a certain wood, which, by rising at early morn, and taking the\\ncheap train, I could reach at eleven in the morning. Here I would\\nbotanize or geologize at my will. My uncle was always glad of specimens\\nfor his herbarium, and stones to examine. When I had filled my wallet, I\\nproceeded to search for nests.\\n\\nAfter about two hours of hard work, I, one day, sat down by a stream to\\neat my humble but copious lunch. How the remembrance of the spiced\\nsausage, the wheaten loaf, and the beer, made my mouth water now! I\\nwould have given every prospect of worldly wealth for such a meal. But\\nto my story.\\n\\nWhile seated thus at my leisure, I looked up at the ruins of an old\\ncastle, at no great distance. It was the remains of an historical\\ndwelling, ivy-clad, and now falling to pieces.\\n\\nWhile looking, I saw two eagles circling about the summit of a lofty\\ntower. I soon became satisfied that there was a nest. Now, in all my\\ncollection, I lacked eggs of the native eagle and the large owl.\\n\\nMy mind was made up. I would reach the summit of that tower, or perish\\nin the attempt. I went nearer, and surveyed the ruins. The old\\nstaircase, years before, had fallen in. The outer walls were, however,\\nintact. There was no chance that way, unless I looked to the ivy solely\\nfor support. This was, as I soon found out, futile.\\n\\nThere remained the chimney, which still went up to the top, and had once\\nserved to carry off the smoke from every story of the tower.\\n\\nUp this I determined to venture. It was narrow, rough, and therefore the\\nmore easily climbed. I took off my coat and crept into the chimney.\\nLooking up, I saw a small, light opening, proclaiming the summit of the\\nchimney.\\n\\nUp--up I went, for some time using my hands and knees, after the fashion\\nof a chimney sweep. It was slow work, but, there being continual\\nprojections, the task was comparatively easy. In this way, I reached\\nhalfway. The chimney now became narrower. The atmosphere was close, and,\\nat last, to end the matter, I stuck fast. I could ascend no higher.\\n\\nThere could be no doubt of this, and there remained no resource but to\\ndescend, and give up my glorious prey in despair. I yielded to fate and\\nendeavored to descend. But I could not move. Some unseen and mysterious\\nobstacle intervened and stopped me. In an instant the full horror of my\\nsituation seized me.\\n\\nI was unable to move either way, and was doomed to a terrible and\\nhorrible death, that of starvation. In a boy\\'s mind, however, there is\\nan extraordinary amount of elasticity and hope, and I began to think of\\nall sorts of plans to escape my gloomy fate.\\n\\nIn the first place, I required no food just at present, having had an\\nexcellent meal, and was therefore allowed time for reflection. My first\\nthought was to try and move the mortar with my hand. Had I possessed a\\nknife, something might have been done, but that useful instrument I had\\nleft in my coat pocket.\\n\\nI soon found that all efforts of this kind were vain and useless, and\\nthat all I could hope to do was to wriggle downwards.\\n\\nBut though I jerked and struggled, and strove to turn, it was all in\\nvain. I could not move an inch, one way or the other. And time flew\\nrapidly. My early rising probably contributed to the fact that I felt\\nsleepy, and gradually gave way to the sensation of drowsiness.\\n\\nI slept, and awoke in darkness, ravenously hungry.\\n\\nNight had come, and still I could not move. I was tight bound, and did\\nnot succeed in changing my position an inch. I groaned aloud. Never\\nsince the days of my happy childhood, when it was a hardship to go from\\nmeal to meal without eating, had I really experienced hunger. The\\nsensation was as novel as it was painful. I began now to lose my head\\nand to scream and cry out in my agony. Something appeared, startled by\\nmy noise. It was a harmless lizard, but it appeared to me a loathsome\\nreptile. Again I made the old ruins resound with my cries, and finally\\nso exhausted myself that I fainted.\\n\\nHow long I lay in a kind of trance or sleep I cannot say, but when again\\nI recovered consciousness it was day. How ill I felt, how hunger still\\ngnawed at me, it would be hard to say. I was too weak to scream now, far\\ntoo weak to struggle.\\n\\nSuddenly I was startled by a roar.\\n\\n\"Are you there, Henry?\" said the voice of my uncle; \"are you there, my\\nboy?\"\\n\\nI could only faintly respond, but I also made a desperate effort to\\nturn. Some mortar fell. To this I owed my being discovered. When the\\nsearch took place, it was easily seen that mortar and small pieces of\\nstone had recently fallen from above. Hence my uncle\\'s cry.\\n\\n\"Be calm,\" he cried, \"if we pull down the whole ruin, you shall be\\nsaved.\"\\n\\nThey were delicious words, but I had little hope.\\n\\nSoon however, about a quarter of an hour later I heard a voice above me,\\nat one of the upper fireplaces.\\n\\n\"Are you below or above?\"\\n\\n\"Below,\" was my reply.\\n\\nIn an instant a basket was lowered with milk, a biscuit, and an egg. My\\nuncle was fearful to be too ready with his supply of food. I drank the\\nmilk first, for thirst had nearly deadened hunger. I then, much\\nrefreshed, ate my bread and hard egg.\\n\\nThey were now at work at the wall. I could hear a pickax. Wishing to\\nescape all danger from this terrible weapon I made a desperate struggle,\\nand the belt, which surrounded my waist and which had been hitched on a\\nstone, gave way. I was free, and only escaped falling down by a rapid\\nmotion of my hands and knees.\\n\\nIn ten minutes more I was in my uncle\\'s arms, after being two days and\\nnights in that horrible prison. My occasional delirium prevented me from\\ncounting time.\\n\\nI was weeks recovering from that awful starvation adventure; and yet\\nwhat was that to the hideous sufferings I now endured?\\n\\nAfter dreaming for some time, and thinking of this and other matters, I\\nonce more looked around me. We were still ascending with fearful\\nrapidity. Every now and then the air appeared to check our respiration\\nas it does that of aeronauts when the ascension of the balloon is too\\nrapid. But if they feel a degree of cold in proportion to the elevation\\nthey attain in the atmosphere, we experienced quite a contrary effect.\\nThe heat began to increase in a most threatening and exceptional manner.\\nI cannot tell exactly the mean, but I think it must have reached one\\nhundred twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nWhat was the meaning of this extraordinary change in the temperature? As\\nfar as we had hitherto gone, facts had proved the theories of Davy and\\nof Lidenbrock to be correct. Until now, all the peculiar conditions of\\nrefractory rocks, of electricity, of magnetism, had modified the general\\nlaws of nature, and had created for us a moderate temperature; for the\\ntheory of the central fire, remained, in my eyes, the only explainable\\none.\\n\\nWere we, then, going to reach a position in which these phenomena were\\nto be carried out in all their rigor, and in which the heat would reduce\\nthe rocks to a state of fusion?\\n\\nSuch was my not unnatural fear, and I did not conceal the fact from my\\nuncle. My way of doing so might be cold and heartless, but I could not\\nhelp it.\\n\\n\"If we are not drowned, or smashed into pancakes, and if we do not die\\nof starvation, we have the satisfaction of knowing that we must be\\nburned alive.\"\\n\\nMy uncle, in presence of this brusque attack, simply shrugged his\\nshoulders, and resumed his reflections--whatever they might be.\\n\\nAn hour passed away, and except that there was a slight increase in the\\ntemperature no incident modified the situation.\\n\\nMy uncle at last, of his own accord, broke silence.\\n\\n\"Well, Henry, my boy,\" he said, in a cheerful way, \"we must make up our\\nminds.\"\\n\\n\"Make up our minds to what?\" I asked, in considerable surprise.\\n\\n\"Well--to something. We must at whatever risk recruit our physical\\nstrength. If we make the fatal mistake of husbanding our little remnant\\nof food, we may probably prolong our wretched existence a few hours--but\\nwe shall remain weak to the end.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I growled, \"to the end. That, however, will not keep us long\\nwaiting.\"\\n\\n\"Well, only let a chance of safety present itself--only allow that a\\nmoment of action be necessary--where shall we find the means of action\\nif we allow ourselves to be reduced to physical weakness by inanition?\"\\n\\n\"When this piece of meat is devoured, Uncle, what hope will there remain\\nunto us?\"\\n\\n\"None, my dear Henry, none. But will it do you any good to devour it\\nwith your eyes? You appear to me to reason like one without will or\\ndecision, like a being without energy.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" cried I, exasperated to a degree which is scarcely to be\\nexplained, \"you do not mean to tell me--that you--that you--have not\\nlost all hope.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly not,\" replied the Professor with consummate coolness.\\n\\n\"You mean to tell me, Uncle, that we shall get out of this monstrous\\nsubterranean shaft?\"\\n\\n\"While there is life there is hope. I beg to assert, Henry, that as long\\nas a man\\'s heart beats, as long as a man\\'s flesh quivers, I do not allow\\nthat a being gifted with thought and will can allow himself to despair.\"\\n\\nWhat a nerve! The man placed in a position like that we occupied must\\nhave been very brave to speak like this.\\n\\n\"Well,\" I cried, \"what do you mean to do?\"\\n\\n\"Eat what remains of the food we have in our hands; let us swallow the\\nlast crumb. It will bel Heaven willing, our last repast. Well, never\\nmind--instead of being exhausted skeletons, we shall be men.\"\\n\\n\"True,\" muttered I in a despairing tone, \"let us take our fill.\"\\n\\n\"We must,\" replied my uncle, with a deep sigh, \"call it what you will.\"\\n\\nMy uncle took a piece of the meat that remained, and some crusts of\\nbiscuit which had escaped the wreck. He divided the whole into three\\nparts.\\n\\nEach had one pound of food to last him as long as he remained in the\\ninterior of the earth.\\n\\nEach now acted in accordance with his own private character.\\n\\nMy uncle, the Professor, ate greedily, but evidently without appetite,\\neating simply from some mechanical motion. I put the food inside my\\nlips, and hungry as I was, chewed my morsel without pleasure, and\\nwithout satisfaction.\\n\\nHans, the guide, just as if he had been eider-down hunting, swallowed\\nevery mouthful, as though it were a usual affair. He looked like a man\\nequally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want.\\n\\nHans, in all probability, was no more used to starvation than ourselves,\\nbut his hardy Icelandic nature had prepared him for many sufferings. As\\nlong as he received his three rix-dollars every Saturday night, he was\\nprepared for anything.\\n\\nThe fact was, Hans never troubled himself about much except his money.\\nHe had undertaken to serve a certain man at so much per week, and no\\nmatter what evils befell his employer or himself, he never found fault\\nor grumbled, so long as his wages were duly paid.\\n\\nSuddenly my uncle roused himself. He had seen a smile on the face of our\\nguide. I could not make it out.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" said my uncle.\\n\\n\"Schiedam,\" said the guide, producing a bottle of this precious fluid.\\n\\nWe drank. My uncle and myself will own to our dying day that hence we\\nderived strength to exist until the last bitter moment. That precious\\nbottle of Hollands was in reality only half full; but, under the\\ncircumstances, it was nectar.\\n\\nIt took some minutes for myself and my uncle to form a decided opinion\\non the subject. The worthy Professor swallowed about half a pint and did\\nnot seem able to drink any more.\\n\\n\"<i>Fortrafflig</i>,\" said Hans, swallowing nearly all that was left.\\n\\n\"Excellent--very good,\" said my uncle, with as much gusto as if he had\\njust left the steps of the club at Hamburg.\\n\\nI had begun to feel as if there had been one gleam of hope. Now all\\nthought of the future vanished!\\n\\nWe had consumed our last ounce of food, and it was five o\\'clock in the\\nmorning!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 42\\n\\nTHE VOLCANIC SHAFT\\n\\n\\nMan\\'s constitution is so peculiar that his health is purely a negative\\nmatter. No sooner is the rage of hunger appeased than it becomes\\ndifficult to comprehend the meaning of starvation. It is only when you\\nsuffer that you really understand.\\n\\nAs to anyone who has not endured privation having any notion of the\\nmatter, it is simply absurd.\\n\\nWith us, after a long fast, some mouthfuls of bread and meat, a little\\nmoldy biscuit and salt beef triumphed over all our previous gloomy and\\nsaturnine thoughts.\\n\\nNevertheless, after this repast each gave way to his own reflections. I\\nwondered what were those of Hans--the man of the extreme north, who was\\nyet gifted with the fatalistic resignation of Oriental character. But\\nthe utmost stretch of the imagination would not allow me to realize the\\ntruth. As for my individual self, my thoughts had ceased to be anything\\nbut memories of the past, and were all connected with that upper world\\nwhich I never should have left. I saw it all now, the beautiful house in\\nthe Konigstrasse, my poor Gretchen, the good Martha; they all passed\\nbefore my mind like visions of the past. Every time any of the\\nlugubrious groanings which were to be distinguished in the hollows\\naround fell upon my ears, I fancied I heard the distant murmur of the\\ngreat cities above my head.\\n\\nAs for my uncle, always thinking of his science, he examined the nature\\nof the shaft by means of a torch. He closely examined the different\\nstrata one above the other, in order to recognize his situation by\\ngeological theory. This calculation, or rather this estimation, could by\\nno means be anything but approximate. But a learned man, a philosopher,\\nis nothing if not a philosopher, when he keeps his ideas calm and\\ncollected; and certainly the Professor possessed this quality to\\nperfection.\\n\\nI heard him, as I sat in silence, murmuring words of geological science.\\nAs I understood his object and his meaning, I could not but interest\\nmyself despite my preoccupation in that terrible hour.\\n\\n\"Eruptive granite,\" he said to himself, \"we are still in the primitive\\nepoch. But we are going up--going up, still going up. But who knows? Who\\nknows?\"\\n\\nThen he still hoped. He felt along the vertical sides of the shaft with\\nhis hand, and some few minutes later, he would go on again in the\\nfollowing style:\\n\\n\"This is gneiss. This is mica schist--siliceous mineral. Good again;\\nthis is the epoch of transition, at all events, we are close to\\nthem--and then, and then--\"\\n\\nWhat could the Professor mean? Could he, by any conceivable means,\\nmeasure the thickness of the crust of the earth suspended above our\\nheads? Did he possess any possible means of making any approximation to\\nthis calculation? No.\\n\\nThe manometer was wanting, and no summary estimation could take the\\nplace of it.\\n\\nAnd yet, as we progressed, the temperature increased in the most\\nextraordinary degree, and I began to feel as if I were bathed in a hot\\nand burning atmosphere. Never before had I felt anything like it. I\\ncould only compare it to the hot vapor from an iron foundry, when the\\nliquid iron is in a state of ebullition and runs over. By degrees, and\\none after the other, Hans, my uncle, and myself had taken off our coats\\nand waistcoats. They were unbearable. Even the slightest garment was not\\nonly uncomfortable, but the cause of extreme suffering.\\n\\n\"Are we ascending to a living fire?\" I cried; when, to my horror and\\nastonishment, the heat became greater than before.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" said my uncle, \"it is simply impossible, quite impossible.\"\\n\\n\"And yet,\" said I, touching the side of the shaft with my naked hand,\\n\"this wall is literally burning.\"\\n\\nAt this moment, feeling as I did that the sides of this extraordinary\\nwall were red hot, I plunged my hands into the water to cool them. I\\ndrew them back with a cry of despair.\\n\\n\"The water is boiling!\" I cried.\\n\\nMy uncle, the Professor, made no reply other than a gesture of rage and\\ndespair.\\n\\nSomething very like the truth had probably struck his imagination.\\n\\nBut I could take no share in either what was going on, or in his\\nspeculations. An invincible dread had taken possession of my brain and\\nsoul. I could only look forward to an immediate catastrophe, such a\\ncatastrophe as not even the most vivid imagination could have thought\\nof. An idea, at first vague and uncertain, was gradually being changed\\ninto certainty.\\n\\nI tremulously rejected it at first, but it forced itself upon me by\\ndegrees with extreme obstinacy. It was so terrible an idea that I\\nscarcely dared to whisper it to myself.\\n\\nAnd yet all the while certain, and as it were, involuntary observations\\ndetermined my convictions. By the doubtful glare of the torch, I could\\nmake out some singular changes in the granitic strata; a strange and\\nterrible phenomenon was about to be produced, in which electricity\\nplayed a part.\\n\\nThen this boiling water, this terrible and excessive heat? I determined\\nas a last resource to examine the compass.\\n\\nThe compass had gone mad!\\n\\nYes, wholly stark staring mad. The needle jumped from pole to pole with\\nsudden and surprising jerks, ran round, or as it is said, boxed the\\ncompass, and then ran suddenly back again as if it had the vertigo.\\n\\nI was aware that, according to the best acknowledged theories, it was a\\nreceived notion that the mineral crust of the globe is never, and never\\nhas been, in a state of complete repose.\\n\\nIt is perpetually undergoing the modifications caused by the\\ndecomposition of internal matter, the agitation consequent on the\\nflowing of extensive liquid currents, the excessive action of magnetism\\nwhich tends to shake it incessantly, at a time when even the\\nmultitudinous beings on its surface do not suspect the seething process\\nto be going on.\\n\\nStill this phenomenon would not have alarmed me alone; it would not have\\naroused in my mind a terrible, an awful idea.\\n\\nBut other facts could not allow my self-delusion to last.\\n\\nTerrible detonations, like Heaven\\'s artillery, began to multiply\\nthemselves with fearful intensity. I could only compare them with the\\nnoise made by hundreds of heavily laden chariots being madly driven over\\na stone pavement. It was a continuous roll of heavy thunder.\\n\\nAnd then the mad compass, shaken by the wild electric phenomena,\\nconfirmed me in my rapidly formed opinion. The mineral crust was about\\nto burst, the heavy granite masses were about to rejoin, the fissure was\\nabout to close, the void was about to be filled up, and we poor atoms to\\nbe crushed in its awful embrace!\\n\\n\"Uncle, Uncle!\" I cried, \"we are wholly, irretrievably lost!\"\\n\\n\"What, then, my young friend, is your new cause of terror and alarm?\" he\\nsaid in his calmest manner. \"What fear you now?\"\\n\\n\"What do I fear now!\" I cried in fierce and angry tones. \"Do you not see\\nthat the walls of the shaft are in motion? Do you not see that the solid\\ngranite masses are cracking? Do you not feel the terrible, torrid heat?\\nDo you not observe the awful boiling water on which we float? Do you not\\nremark this mad needle? Every sign and portent of an awful earthquake!\"\\n\\nMy uncle coolly shook his head.\\n\\n\"An earthquake,\" he replied in the most calm and provoking tone.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"My nephew, I tell you that you are utterly mistaken,\" he continued.\\n\\n\"Do you not, can you not, recognize all the well-known symtons--\"\\n\\n\"Of an earthquake? By no means. I am expecting something far more\\nimportant.\"\\n\\n\"My brain is strained beyond endurance--what, what do you mean?\" I\\ncried.\\n\\n\"An eruption, Harry.\"\\n\\n\"An eruption,\" I gasped. \"We are, then, in the volcanic shaft of a\\ncrater in full action and vigor.\"\\n\\n\"I have every reason to think so,\" said the Professor in a smiling tone,\\n\"and I beg to tell you that it is the most fortunate thing that could\\nhappen to us.\"\\n\\nThe most fortunate thing! Had my uncle really and truly gone mad? What\\ndid he mean by these awful words--what did he mean by this terrible\\ncalm, this solemn smile?\\n\\n\"What!\" cried I, in the height of my exasperation, \"we are on the way to\\nan eruption, are we? Fatality has cast us into a well of burning and\\nboiling lava, of rocks on fire, of boiling water, in a word, filled with\\nevery kind of eruptive matter? We are about to be expelled, thrown up,\\nvomited, spit out of the interior of the earth, in common with huge\\nblocks of granite, with showers of cinders and scoriae, in a wild\\nwhirlwind of flame, and you say--the most fortunate thing which could\\nhappen to us.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" replied the Professor, looking at me calmly from under his\\nspectacles, \"it is the only chance which remains to us of ever escaping\\nfrom the interior of the earth to the light of day.\"\\n\\nIt is quite impossible that I can put on paper the thousand strange,\\nwild thoughts which followed this extraordinary announcement.\\n\\nBut my uncle was right, quite right, and never had he appeared to me so\\naudacious and so convinced as when he looked me calmly in the face and\\nspoke of the chances of an eruption--of our being cast upon Mother Earth\\nonce more through the gaping crater of a volcano!\\n\\nNevertheless, while we were speaking we were still ascending; we passed\\nthe whole night going up, or to speak more scientifically, in an\\nascensional motion. The fearful noise redoubled; I was ready to\\nsuffocate. I seriously believed that my last hour was approaching, and\\nyet, so strange is imagination, all I thought of was some childish\\nhypothesis or other. In such circumstances you do not choose your own\\nthoughts. They overcome you.\\n\\nIt was quite evident that we were being cast upwards by eruptive matter;\\nunder the raft there was a mass of boiling water, and under this was a\\nheavier mass of lava, and an aggregate of rocks which, on reaching the\\nsummit of the water, would be dispersed in every direction.\\n\\nThat we were inside the chimney of a volcano there could no longer be\\nthe shadow of a doubt. Nothing more terrible could be conceived!\\n\\nBut on this occasion, instead of Sneffels, an old and extinct volcano,\\nwe were inside a mountain of fire in full activity. Several times I\\nfound myself asking, what mountain was it, and on what part of the world\\nwe should be shot out. As if it were of any consequence!\\n\\nIn the northern regions, there could be no reasonable doubt about that.\\nBefore it went decidedly mad, the compass had never made the slightest\\nmistake. From the cape of Saknussemm, we had been swept away to the\\nnorthward many hundreds of leagues. Now the question was, were we once\\nmore under Iceland--should we be belched forth on to the earth through\\nthe crater of Mount Hecla, or should we reappear through one of the\\nother seven fire funnels of the island? Taking in my mental vision a\\nradius of five hundred leagues to the westward, I could see under this\\nparallel only the little-known volcanoes of the northwest coast of\\nAmerica.\\n\\nTo the east one only existed somewhere about the eightieth degree of\\nlatitude, the Esk, upon the island of Jan Mayen, not far from the frozen\\nregions of Spitsbergen.\\n\\nIt was not craters that were wanting, and many of them were big enough\\nto vomit a whole army; all I wished to know was the particular one\\ntowards which we were making with such fearful velocity.\\n\\nI often think now of my folly: as if I should ever have expected to\\nescape!\\n\\nTowards morning, the ascending motion became greater and greater. If the\\ndegree of heat increased instead of decreasing, as we approached the\\nsurface of the earth, it was simply because the causes were local and\\nwholly due to volcanic influence. Our very style of locomotion left in\\nmy mind no doubt upon the subject. An enormous force, a force of several\\nhundreds of atmospheres produced by the vapors accumulated and long\\ncompressed in the interior of the earth, was hoisting us upwards with\\nirresistible power.\\n\\nBut though we were approaching the light of day, to what fearful dangers\\nwere we about to be exposed?\\n\\nInstant death appeared the only fate which we could expect or\\ncontemplate.\\n\\nSoon a dim, sepulchral light penetrated the vertical gallery, which\\nbecame wider and wider. I could make out to the right and left long dark\\ncorridors like immense tunnels, from which awful and horrid vapors\\npoured out. Tongues of fire, sparkling and crackling, appeared about to\\nlick us up.\\n\\nThe hour had come!\\n\\n\"Look, Uncle, look!\" I cried.\\n\\n\"Well, what you see are the great sulphurous flames. Nothing more common\\nin connection with an eruption.\"\\n\\n\"But if they lap us round!\" I angrily replied.\\n\\n\"They will not lap us round,\" was his quiet and serene answer.\\n\\n\"But it will be all the same in the end if they stifle us,\" I cried.\\n\\n\"We shall not be stifled. The gallery is rapidly becoming wider and\\nwider, and if it be necessary, we will presently leave the raft and take\\nrefuge in some fissure in the rock.\"\\n\\n\"But the water, the water, which is continually ascending?\" I\\ndespairingly replied.\\n\\n\"There is no longer any water, Harry,\" he answered, \"but a kind of lava\\npaste, which is heaving us up, in company with itself, to the mouth of\\nthe crater.\"\\n\\nIn truth, the liquid column of water had wholly disappeared to give\\nplace to dense masses of boiling eruptive matter. The temperature was\\nbecoming utterly insupportable, and a thermometer exposed to this\\natmosphere would have marked between one hundred and eighty-nine and one\\nhundred ninety degrees Fahrenheit.\\n\\nPerspiration rushed from every pore. But for the extraordinary rapidity\\nof our ascent we should have been stifled.\\n\\nNevertheless, the Professor did not carry out his proposition of\\nabandoning the raft; and he did quite wisely. Those few ill-joined beams\\noffered, anyway, a solid surface--a support which elsewhere must have\\nutterly failed us.\\n\\nTowards eight o\\'clock in the morning a new incident startled us. The\\nascensional movement suddenly ceased. The raft became still and\\nmotionless.\\n\\n\"What is the matter now?\" I said, querulously, very much startled by\\nthis change.\\n\\n\"A simple halt,\" replied my uncle.\\n\\n\"Is the eruption about to fail?\" I asked.\\n\\n\"I hope not.\"\\n\\nWithout making any reply, I rose. I tried to look around me. Perhaps the\\nraft, checked by some projecting rock, opposed a momentary resistance to\\nthe eruptive mass. In this case, it was absolutely necessary to release\\nit as quickly as possible.\\n\\nNothing of the kind had occurred. The column of cinders, of scoriae, of\\nbroken rocks and earth, had wholly ceased to ascend.\\n\\n\"I tell you, Uncle, that the eruption has stopped,\" was my oracular\\ndecision.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said my uncle, \"you think so, my boy. You are wrong. Do not be in\\nthe least alarmed; this sudden moment of calm will not last long, be\\nassured. It has already endured five minutes, and before we are many\\nminutes older we shall be continuing our journey to the mouth of the\\ncrater.\"\\n\\nAll the time he was speaking the Professor continued to consult his\\nchronometer, and he was probably right in his prognostics. Soon the raft\\nresumed its motion, in a very rapid and disorderly way, which lasted two\\nminutes or thereabout; and then again it stopped as suddenly as before.\\n\\n\"Good,\" said my uncle, observing the hour, \"in ten we shall start\\nagain.\"\\n\\n\"In ten minutes?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--precisely. We have to do with a volcano, the eruption of which is\\nintermittent. We are compelled to breathe just as it does.\"\\n\\nNothing could be more true. At the exact minute he had indicated, we\\nwere again launched on high with extreme rapidity. Not to be cast off\\nthe raft, it was necessary to hold on to the beams. Then the hoist again\\nceased.\\n\\nMany times since have I thought of this singular phenomenon without\\nbeing able to find for it any satisfactory explanation. Nevertheless, it\\nappeared quite clear to me, that we were not in the principal chimney of\\nthe volcano, but in an accessory conduit, where we felt the counter\\nshock of the great and principal tunnel filled by burning lava.\\n\\nIt is impossible for me to say how many times this maneuver was\\nrepeated. All that I can remember is, that on every ascensional motion,\\nwe were hoisted up with ever increasing velocity, as if we had been\\nlaunched from a huge projectile. During the sudden halts we were nearly\\nstifled; during the moments of projection the hot air took away our\\nbreath.\\n\\nI thought for a moment of the voluptuous joy of suddenly finding myself\\nin the hyperborean regions with the cold thirty degrees below zero!\\n\\nMy exalted imagination pictured to itself the vast snowy plains of the\\narctic regions, and I was impatient to roll myself on the icy carpet of\\nthe North Pole.\\n\\nBy degrees my head, utterly overcome by a series of violent emotions,\\nbegan to give way to hallucination. I was delirious. Had it not been for\\nthe powerful arms of Hans, the guide, I should have broken my head\\nagainst the granite masses of the shaft.\\n\\nI have, in consequence, kept no account of what followed for many hours.\\nI have a vague and confused remembrance of continual detonations, of the\\nshaking of the huge granitic mass, and of the raft going round like a\\nspinning top. It floated on the stream of hot lava, amidst a falling\\ncloud of cinders. The huge flames roaring, wrapped us around.\\n\\nA storm of wind which appeared to be cast forth from an immense\\nventilator roused up the interior fires of the earth. It was a hot,\\nincandescent blast!\\n\\nAt last I saw the figure of Hans as if enveloped in the huge halo of\\nburning blaze, and no other sense remained to me but that sinister dread\\nwhich the condemned victim may be supposed to feel when led to the mouth\\nof a cannon, at the supreme moment when the shot is fired and his limbs\\nare dispersed into empty space.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 43\\n\\nDAYLIGHT AT LAST\\n\\n\\nWhen I opened my eyes I felt the hand of the guide clutching me firmly\\nby the belt. With his other hand he supported my uncle. I was not\\ngrievously wounded, but bruised all over in the most remarkable manner.\\n\\nAfter a moment I looked around, and found that I was lying down on the\\nslope of a mountain not two yards from a yawning gulf into which I\\nshould have fallen had I made the slightest false step. Hans had saved\\nme from death, while I rolled insensible on the flanks of the crater.\\n\\n\"Where are we?\" dreamily asked my uncle, who literally appeared to be\\ndisgusted at having returned to earth.\\n\\nThe eider-down hunter simply shrugged his shoulders as a mark of total\\nignorance.\\n\\n\"In Iceland?\" said I, not positively but interrogatively.\\n\\n\"Nej,\" said Hans.\\n\\n\"How do you mean?\" cried the Professor; \"no--what are your reasons?\"\\n\\n\"Hans is wrong,\" said I, rising.\\n\\nAfter all the innumerable surprises of this journey, a yet more singular\\none was reserved to us. I expected to see a cone covered by snow, by\\nextensive and widespread glaciers, in the midst of the arid deserts of\\nthe extreme northern regions, beneath the full rays of a polar sky,\\nbeyond the highest latitudes.\\n\\nBut contrary to all our expectations, I, my uncle, and the Icelander,\\nwere cast upon the slope of a mountain calcined by the burning rays of a\\nsun which was literally baking us with its fires.\\n\\nI could not believe my eyes, but the actual heat which affected my body\\nallowed me no chance of doubting. We came out of the crater half naked,\\nand the radiant star from which we had asked nothing for two months, was\\ngood enough to be prodigal to us of light and warmth--a light and warmth\\nwe could easily have dispensed with.\\n\\nWhen our eyes were accustomed to the light we had lost sight of so long,\\nI used them to rectify the errors of my imagination. Whatever happened,\\nwe should have been at Spitsbergen, and I was in no humor to yield to\\nanything but the most absolute proof.\\n\\nAfter some delay, the Professor spoke.\\n\\n\"Hem!\" he said, in a hesitating kind of way, \"it really does not look\\nlike Iceland.\"\\n\\n\"But supposing it were the island of Jan Mayen?\" I ventured to observe.\\n\\n\"Not in the least, my boy. This is not one of the volcanoes of the\\nnorth, with its hills of granite and its crown of snow.\"\\n\\n\"Nevertheless--\"\\n\\n\"Look, look, my boy,\" said the Professor, as dogmatically as usual.\\n\\nRight above our heads, at a great height, opened the crater of a volcano\\nfrom which escaped, from one quarter of an hour to the other, with a\\nvery loud explosion, a lofty jet of flame mingled with pumice stone,\\ncinders, and lava. I could feel the convulsions of nature in the\\nmountain, which breathed like a huge whale, throwing up from time to\\ntime fire and air through its enormous vents.\\n\\nBelow, and floating along a slope of considerable angularity, the stream\\nof eruptive matter spread away to a depth which did not give the volcano\\na height of three hundred fathoms.\\n\\nIts base disappeared in a perfect forest of green trees, among which I\\nperceived olives, fig trees, and vines loaded with rich grapes.\\n\\nCertainly this was not the ordinary aspect of the arctic regions. About\\nthat there could not be the slightest doubt.\\n\\nWhen the eye was satisfied at its glimpse of this verdant expanse, it\\nfell upon the waters of a lovely sea or beautiful lake, which made of\\nthis enchanted land an island of not many leagues in extent.\\n\\nOn the side of the rising sun was to be seen a little port, crowded with\\nhouses, and near which the boats and vessels of peculiar build were\\nfloating upon azure waves.\\n\\nBeyond, groups of islands rose above the liquid plain, so numerous and\\nclose together as to resemble a vast beehive.\\n\\nTowards the setting sun, some distant shores were to be made out on the\\nedge of the horizon. Some presented the appearance of blue mountains of\\nharmonious conformation; upon others, much more distant, there appeared\\na prodigiously lofty cone, above the summit of which hung dark and heavy\\nclouds.\\n\\nTowards the north, an immense expanse of water sparkled beneath the\\nsolar rays, occasionally allowing the extremity of a mast or the\\nconvexity of a sail bellying to the wind, to be seen.\\n\\nThe unexpected character of such a scene added a hundredfold to its\\nmarvelous beauties.\\n\\n\"Where can we be?\" I asked, speaking in a low and solemn voice.\\n\\nHans shut his eyes with an air of indifference, and my uncle looked on\\nwithout clearly understanding.\\n\\n\"Whatever this mountain may be,\" he said, at last, \"I must confess it is\\nrather warm. The explosions do not leave off, and I do not think it is\\nworthwhile to have left the interior of a volcano and remain here to\\nreceive a huge piece of rock upon one\\'s head. Let us carefully descend\\nthe mountain and discover the real state of the case. To confess the\\ntruth, I am dying of hunger and thirst.\"\\n\\nDecidedly the Professor was no longer a truly reflective character. For\\nmyself, forgetting all my necessities, ignoring my fatigues and\\nsufferings, I should have remained still for several hours longer--but\\nit was necessary to follow my companions.\\n\\nThe slope of the volcano was very steep and slippery; we slid over piles\\nof ashes, avoiding the streams of hot lava which glided about like fiery\\nserpents. Still, while we were advancing, I spoke with extreme\\nvolubility, for my imagination was too full not to explode in words.\\n\\n\"We are in Asia!\" I exclaimed; \"we are on the coast of India, in the\\ngreat Malay islands, in the centre of Oceania. We have crossed the one\\nhalf of the globe to come out right at the antipodes of Europe!\"\\n\\n\"But the compass!\" exclaimed my uncle; \"explain that to me!\"\\n\\n\"Yes--the compass,\" I said with considerable hesitation. \"I grant that\\nis a difficulty. According to it, we have always been going northward.\"\\n\\n\"Then it lied.\"\\n\\n\"Hem--to say it lied is rather a harsh word,\" was my answer.\\n\\n\"Then we are at the North Pole--\"\\n\\n\"The Pole--no--well--well I give it up,\" was my reply.\\n\\nThe plain truth was, that there was no explanation possible. I could\\nmake nothing of it.\\n\\nAnd all the while we were approaching this beautiful verdure, hunger and\\nthirst tormented me fearfully. Happily, after two long hours\\' march, a\\nbeautiful country spread out before us, covered by olives, pomegranates,\\nand vines, which appeared to belong to anybody and everybody. In any\\nevent, in the state of destitution into which we had fallen, we were not\\nin a mood to ponder too scrupulously.\\n\\nWhat delight it was to press these delicious fruits to our lips, and to\\nbite at grapes and pomegranates fresh from the vine.\\n\\nNot far off, near some fresh and mossy grass, under the delicious shade\\nof some trees, I discovered a spring of fresh water, in which we\\nvoluptuously laved our faces, hands, and feet.\\n\\nWhile we were all giving way to the delights of new-found pleasures, a\\nlittle child appeared between two tufted olive trees.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" cried I, \"an inhabitant of this happy country.\"\\n\\nThe little fellow was poorly dressed, weak, and suffering, and appeared\\nterribly alarmed at our appearance. Half-naked, with tangled, matted and\\nragged beards, we did look supremely ill-favored; and unless the country\\nwas a bandit land, we were not likely to alarm the inhabitants!\\n\\nJust as the boy was about to take to his heels, Hans ran after him, and\\nbrought him back, despite his cries and kicks.\\n\\nMy uncle tried to look as gentle as possible, and then spoke in German.\\n\\n\"What is the name of this mountain, my friend?\"\\n\\nThe child made no reply.\\n\\n\"Good,\" said my uncle, with a very positive air of conviction, \"we are\\nnot in Germany.\"\\n\\nHe then made the same demand in English, of which language he was an\\nexcellent scholar.\\n\\nThe child shook its head and made no reply. I began to be considerably\\npuzzled.\\n\\n\"Is he dumb?\" cried the Professor, who was rather proud of his polyglot\\nknowledge of languages, and made the same demand in French.\\n\\nThe boy only stared in his face.\\n\\n\"I must perforce try him in Italian,\" said my uncle, with a shrug.\\n\\n\"<i>Dove noi siamo</i>?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, tell me where we are?\" I added impatiently and eagerly.\\n\\nAgain the boy remained silent.\\n\\n\"My fine fellow, do you or do you not mean to speak?\" cried my uncle,\\nwho began to get angry. He shook him, and spoke another dialect of the\\nItalian language.\\n\\n\"<i>Come si noma questa isola</i>?\"--\"What is the name of this island?\"\\n\\n\"Stromboli,\" replied the rickety little shepherd, dashing away from Hans\\nand disappearing in the olive groves.\\n\\nWe thought little enough about him.\\n\\nStromboli! What effect on the imagination did these few words produce!\\nWe were in the centre of the Mediterranean, amidst the eastern\\narchipelago of mythological memory, in the ancient Strongylos, where\\nAEolus kept the wind and the tempest chained up. And those blue\\nmountains, which rose towards the rising sun, were the mountains of\\nCalabria.\\n\\nAnd that mighty volcano which rose on the southern horizon was Etna, the\\nfierce and celebrated Etna!\\n\\n\"Stromboli! Stromboli!\" I repeated to myself.\\n\\nMy uncle played a regular accompaniment to my gestures and words. We\\nwere singing together like an ancient chorus.\\n\\nAh--what a journey--what a marvelous and extraordinary journey! Here we\\nhad entered the earth by one volcano, and we had come out by another.\\nAnd this other was situated more than twelve hundred leagues from\\nSneffels from that drear country of Iceland cast away on the confines of\\nthe earth. The wondrous changes of this expedition had transported us to\\nthe most harmonious and beautiful of earthly lands. We had abandoned the\\nregion of eternal snows for that of infinite verdure, and had left over\\nour heads the gray fog of the icy regions to come back to the azure sky\\nof Sicily!\\n\\nAfter a delicious repast of fruits and fresh water, we again continued\\nour journey in order to reach the port of Stromboli. To say how we had\\nreached the island would scarcely have been prudent. The superstitious\\ncharacter of the Italians would have been at work, and we should have\\nbeen called demons vomited from the infernal regions. It was therefore\\nnecessary to pass for humble and unfortunate shipwrecked travelers. It\\nwas certainly less striking and romantic, but it was decidedly safer.\\n\\nAs we advanced, I could hear my worthy uncle muttering to himself:\\n\\n\"But the compass. The compass most certainly marked north. This is a\\nfact I cannot explain in any way.\"\\n\\n\"Well, the fact is,\" said I, with an air of disdain, \"we must not\\nexplain anything. It will be much more easy.\"\\n\\n\"I should like to see a professor of the Johanneum Institution who is\\nunable to explain a cosmic phenomenon--it would indeed be strange.\"\\n\\nAnd speaking thus, my uncle, half-naked, his leathern purse round his\\nloins, and his spectacles upon his nose, became once more the terrible\\nProfessor of Mineralogy.\\n\\nAn hour after leaving the wood of olives, we reached the fort of San\\nVicenza, where Hans demanded the price of his thirteenth week of\\nservice. My uncle paid him, with very many warm shakes of the hand.\\n\\nAt that moment, if he did not indeed quite share our natural emotion, he\\nallowed his feelings so far to give way as to indulge in an\\nextraordinary expression for him.\\n\\nWith the tips of two fingers he gently pressed our hands and smiled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 44\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY ENDED\\n\\n\\nThis is the final conclusion of a narrative which will be probably\\ndisbelieved even by people who are astonished at nothing. I am, however,\\narmed at all points against human incredulity.\\n\\nWe were kindly received by the Strombolite fishermen, who treated us as\\nshipwrecked travelers. They gave us clothes and food. After a delay of\\nforty-eight hours, on the 30th of September a little vessel took us to\\nMessina, where a few days of delightful and complete repose restored us\\nto ourselves.\\n\\nOn Friday, the 4th of October, we embarked in the Volturne, one of the\\npostal packets of the Imperial Messageries of France; and three days\\nlater we landed at Marseilles, having no other care on our minds but\\nthat of our precious but erratic compass. This inexplicable circumstance\\ntormented me terribly. On the 9th of October, in the evening, we reached\\nHamburg.\\n\\nWhat was the astonishment of Martha, what the joy of Gretchen! I will\\nnot attempt to define it.\\n\\n\"Now then, Harry, that you really are a hero,\" she said, \"there is no\\nreason why you should ever leave me again.\"\\n\\nI looked at her. She was weeping tears of joy.\\n\\nI leave it to be imagined if the return of Professor Hardwigg made or\\ndid not make a sensation in Hamburg. Thanks to the indiscretion of\\nMartha, the news of his departure for the interior of the earth had been\\nspread over the whole world.\\n\\nNo one would believe it--and when they saw him come back in safety they\\nbelieved it all the less.\\n\\nBut the presence of Hans and many stray scraps of information by degrees\\nmodified public opinion.\\n\\nThen my uncle became a great man and I the nephew of a great man, which,\\nat all events, is something. Hamburg gave a festival in our honor. A\\npublic meeting of the Johanneum Institution was held, at which the\\nProfessor related the whole story of his adventures, omitting only the\\nfacts in connection with the compass.\\n\\nThat same day he deposited in the archives of the town the document he\\nhad found written by Saknussemm, and he expressed his great regret that\\ncircumstances, stronger than his will, did not allow him to follow the\\nIcelandic traveler\\'s track into the very centre of the earth. He was\\nmodest in his glory, but his reputation only increased.\\n\\nSo much honor necessarily created for him many envious enemies. Of\\ncourse they existed, and as his theories, supported by certain facts,\\ncontradicted the system of science upon the question of central heat, he\\nmaintained his own views both with pen and speech against the learned of\\nevery country. Although I still believe in the theory of central heat, I\\nconfess that certain circumstances, hitherto very ill defined, may\\nmodify the laws of such natural phenomena.\\n\\nAt the moment when these questions were being discussed with interest,\\nmy uncle received a rude shock--one that he felt very much. Hans,\\ndespite everything he could say to the contrary, quitted Hamburg; the\\nman to whom we owed so much would not allow us to pay our deep debt of\\ngratitude. He was taken with nostalgia; a love for his Icelandic home.\\n\\n\"Farval,\" said he, one day, and with this one short word of adieu, he\\nstarted for Reykjavik, which he soon reached in safety.\\n\\nWe were deeply attached to our brave eider-duck hunter. His absence will\\nnever cause him to be forgotten by those whose lives he saved, and I\\nhope, at some not distant day, to see him again.\\n\\nTo conclude, I may say that our journey into the interior of the earth\\ncreated an enormous sensation throughout the civilized world. It was\\ntranslated and printed in many languages. All the leading journals\\npublished extracts from it, which were commentated, discussed, attacked,\\nand supported with equal animation by those who believed in its\\nepisodes, and by those who were utterly incredulous.\\n\\nWonderful! My uncle enjoyed during his lifetime all the glory he\\ndeserved; and he was even offered a large sum of money, by Mr. Barnum,\\nto exhibit himself in the United States; while I am credibly informed by\\na traveler that he is to be seen in waxwork at Madame Tussaud\\'s!\\n\\nBut one care preyed upon his mind, a care which rendered him very\\nunhappy. One fact remained inexplicable--that of the compass. For a\\nlearned man to be baffled by such an inexplicable phenomenon was very\\naggravating. But Heaven was merciful, and in the end my uncle was happy.\\n\\nOne day, while he put some minerals belonging to his collection in\\norder, I fell upon the famous compass and examined it keenly.\\n\\nFor six months it had lain unnoticed and untouched.\\n\\nI looked at it with curiosity, which soon became surprise. I gave a loud\\ncry. The Professor, who was at hand, soon joined me.\\n\\n\"What is the matter?\" he cried.\\n\\n\"The compass!\"\\n\\n\"What then?\"\\n\\n\"Why its needle points to the south and not to the north.\"\\n\\n\"My dear boy, you must be dreaming.\"\\n\\n\"I am not dreaming. See--the poles are changed.\"\\n\\n\"Changed!\"\\n\\nMy uncle put on his spectacles, examined the instrument, and leaped with\\njoy, shaking the whole house.\\n\\nA clear light fell upon our minds.\\n\\n\"Here it is!\" he cried, as soon as he had recovered the use of his\\nspeech, \"after we had once passed Cape Saknussemm, the needle of this\\ncompass pointed to the southward instead of the northward.\"\\n\\n\"Evidently.\"\\n\\n\"Our error is now easily explained. But to what phenomenon do we owe\\nthis alteration in the needle?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing more simple.\"\\n\\n\"Explain yourself, my boy. I am on thorns.\"\\n\\n\"During the storm, upon the Central Sea, the ball of fire which made a\\nmagnet of the iron in our raft, turned our compass topsy-turvy.\"\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried the Professor, with a loud and ringing laugh, \"it was a\\ntrick of that inexplicable electricity.\"\\n\\nFrom that hour my uncle was the happiest of learned men, and I the\\nhappiest of ordinary mortals. For my pretty Virland girl, abdicating her\\nposition as ward, took her place in the house in the Konigstrasse in the\\ndouble quality of niece and wife.\\n\\nWe need scarcely mention that her uncle was the illustrious Professor\\nHardwigg, corresponding member of all the scientific, geographical,\\nmineralogical, and geological societies of the five parts of the globe.\\n\\nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\\nAn Underwater Tour of the World\\n\\nJULES VERNE\\n\\n\\nTranslated from the Original French by F.

Conclusion\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n“The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us,” admits\\nProfessor Aronnax early in this novel. “What goes on in those distant\\ndepths? What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve\\nor fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? It’s almost beyond\\nconjecture.”\\n\\nJules Verne (1828-1905) published the French equivalents of these\\nwords in 1869, and little has changed since. 126 years later, a Time\\ncover story on deep-sea exploration made much the same admission: “We\\nknow more about Mars than we know about the oceans.” This reality\\nbegins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of\\nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.\\n\\nBorn in the French river town of Nantes, Verne had a lifelong passion\\nfor the sea. First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated\\nauthor and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages—to Britain, America,\\nthe Mediterranean. But the specific stimulus for this novel was an\\n1865 fan letter from a fellow writer, Madame George Sand. She praised\\nVerne’s two early novels Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to\\nthe Center of the Earth (1864), then added: “Soon I hope you’ll take\\nus into the ocean depths, your characters traveling in diving\\nequipment perfected by your science and your imagination.” Thus\\ninspired, Verne created one of literature’s great rebels, a freedom\\nfighter who plunged beneath the waves to wage a unique form of\\nguerilla warfare.\\n\\nInitially, Verne’s narrative was influenced by the 1863 uprising of\\nPoland against Tsarist Russia. The Poles were quashed with a violence\\nthat appalled not only Verne but all Europe. As originally conceived,\\nVerne’s Captain Nemo was a Polish nobleman whose entire family had\\nbeen slaughtered by Russian troops. Nemo builds a fabulous futuristic\\nsubmarine, the Nautilus, then conducts an underwater campaign of\\nvengeance against his imperialist oppressor.\\n\\nBut in the 1860s France had to treat the Tsar as an ally, and Verne’s\\npublisher Pierre Hetzel pronounced the book unprintable. Verne\\nreworked its political content, devising new nationalities for Nemo\\nand his great enemy—information revealed only in a later novel, The\\nMysterious Island (1875); in the present work Nemo’s background\\nremains a dark secret. In all, the novel had a difficult\\ngestation. Verne and Hetzel were in constant conflict and the book\\nwent through multiple drafts, struggles reflected in its several\\nworking titles over the period 1865-69: early on, it was variously\\ncalled Voyage Under the Waters, Twenty-five Thousand Leagues Under the\\nWaters, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Waters, and A Thousand\\nLeagues Under the Oceans.\\n\\nVerne is often dubbed, in Isaac Asimov’s phrase, “the world’s first\\nscience-fiction writer.” And it’s true, many of his sixty-odd books do\\nanticipate future events and technologies: From the Earth to the Moon\\n(1865) and Hector Servadac (1877) deal in space travel, while Journey\\nto the Center of the Earth features travel to the earth’s core. But\\nwith Verne the operative word is “travel,” and some of his best-known\\ntitles don’t really qualify as sci-fi: Around the World in Eighty Days\\n(1872) and Michael Strogoff (1876) are closer to “travelogs”—adventure\\nyarns in far-away places.\\n\\nThese observations partly apply here. The subtitle of the present book\\nis An Underwater Tour of the World, so in good travelog style, the\\nNautilus’s exploits supply an episodic story line. Shark attacks,\\ngiant squid, cannibals, hurricanes, whale hunts, and other rip-roaring\\nadventures erupt almost at random. Yet this loose structure gives the\\nnovel an air of documentary realism. What’s more, Verne adds backbone\\nto the action by developing three recurring motifs: the deepening\\nmystery of Nemo’s past life and future intentions, the mounting\\ntension between Nemo and hot-tempered harpooner Ned Land, and Ned’s\\nongoing schemes to escape from the Nautilus. These unifying threads\\ntighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum.\\n\\nOther subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling\\nwith wit, information, and insight. Verne regards the sea from many\\nangles: in the domain of marine biology, he gives us thumbnail\\nsketches of fish, seashells, coral, sometimes in great catalogs that\\nswirl past like musical cascades; in the realm of geology, he studies\\nvolcanoes literally inside and out; in the world of commerce, he\\ncelebrates the high-energy entrepreneurs who lay the Atlantic Cable or\\ndig the Suez Canal. And Verne’s marine engineering proves especially\\nauthoritative. His specifications for an open-sea submarine and a\\nself-contained diving suit were decades before their time, yet modern\\ntechnology bears them out triumphantly.\\n\\nTrue, today’s scientists know a few things he didn’t: the South Pole\\nisn’t at the water’s edge but far inland; sharks don’t flip over\\nbefore attacking; giant squid sport ten tentacles not eight; sperm\\nwhales don’t prey on their whalebone cousins. This notwithstanding,\\nVerne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths\\nbefore the arrival of Jacques Cousteau and technicolor film.\\n\\nLastly the book has stature as a novel of character. Even the\\nsupporting cast is shrewdly drawn: Professor Aronnax, the career\\nscientist caught in an ethical conflict; Conseil, the compulsive\\nclassifier who supplies humorous tag lines for Verne’s fast facts; the\\nharpooner Ned Land, a creature of constant appetites, man as heroic\\nanimal.\\n\\nBut much of the novel’s brooding power comes from Captain\\nNemo. Inventor, musician, Renaissance genius, he’s a trail-blazing\\ncreation, the prototype not only for countless renegade scientists in\\npopular fiction, but even for such varied figures as Sherlock Holmes\\nor Wolf Larsen. However, Verne gives his hero’s brilliance and\\nbenevolence a dark underside—the man’s obsessive hate for his old\\nenemy. This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions: he’s a\\nfighter for freedom, yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there\\nfor good; he works to save lives, both human and animal, yet he\\nhimself creates a holocaust; he detests imperialism, yet he lays\\npersonal claim to the South Pole. And in this last action he falls\\ninto the classic sin of Pride. He’s swiftly punished. The Nautilus\\nnearly perishes in the Antarctic and Nemo sinks into a growing\\ndepression.\\n\\nLike Shakespeare’s King Lear he courts death and madness in a great\\nstorm, then commits mass murder, collapses in catatonic paralysis, and\\nsuicidally runs his ship into the ocean’s most dangerous\\nwhirlpool. Hate swallows him whole.\\n\\nFor many, then, this book has been a source of fascination, surely one\\nof the most influential novels ever written, an inspiration for such\\nscientists and discoverers as engineer Simon Lake, oceanographer\\nWilliam Beebe, polar traveler Sir Ernest Shackleton. Likewise\\nDr. Robert D. Ballard, finder of the sunken Titanic, confesses that\\nthis was his favorite book as a teenager, and Cousteau himself, most\\nrenowned of marine explorers, called it his shipboard bible.\\n\\nThe present translation is a faithful yet communicative rendering of\\nthe original French texts published in Paris by J. Hetzel et Cie.—the\\nhardcover first edition issued in the autumn of 1871, collated with\\nthe softcover editions of the First and Second Parts issued separately\\nin the autumn of 1869 and the summer of 1870. Although prior English\\nversions have often been heavily abridged, this new translation is\\ncomplete to the smallest substantive detail.\\n\\nBecause, as that Time cover story suggests, we still haven’t caught up\\nwith Verne. Even in our era of satellite dishes and video games, the\\nseas keep their secrets. We’ve seen progress in sonar, torpedoes, and\\nother belligerent machinery, but sailors and scientists—to say nothing\\nof tourists—have yet to voyage in a submarine with the luxury and\\nefficiency of the Nautilus.\\n\\nF.

Without getting into those rumors that upset civilians in\\nthe seaports and deranged the public mind even far inland, it must be\\nsaid that professional seamen were especially alarmed. Traders,\\nshipowners, captains of vessels, skippers, and master mariners from\\nEurope and America, naval officers from every country, and at their\\nheels the various national governments on these two continents, were\\nall extremely disturbed by the business.\\n\\nIn essence, over a period of time several ships had encountered “an\\nenormous thing” at sea, a long spindle-shaped object, sometimes giving\\noff a phosphorescent glow, infinitely bigger and faster than any\\nwhale.\\n\\nThe relevant data on this apparition, as recorded in various logbooks,\\nagreed pretty closely as to the structure of the object or creature in\\nquestion, its unprecedented speed of movement, its startling\\nlocomotive power, and the unique vitality with which it seemed to be\\ngifted. If it was a cetacean, it exceeded in bulk any whale previously\\nclassified by science. No naturalist, neither Cuvier nor Lacépède,\\nneither Professor Dumeril nor Professor de Quatrefages, would have\\naccepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen—specifically,\\nunseen by their own scientific eyes.\\n\\nStriking an average of observations taken at different times—rejecting\\nthose timid estimates that gave the object a length of 200 feet, and\\nignoring those exaggerated views that saw it as a mile wide and three\\nlong—you could still assert that this phenomenal creature greatly\\nexceeded the dimensions of anything then known to ichthyologists, if\\nit existed at all.\\n\\nNow then, it did exist, this was an undeniable fact; and since the\\nhuman mind dotes on objects of wonder, you can understand the\\nworldwide excitement caused by this unearthly apparition. As for\\nrelegating it to the realm of fiction, that charge had to be dropped.\\n\\nIn essence, on July 20, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, from the\\nCalcutta & Burnach Steam Navigation Co., encountered this moving mass\\nfive miles off the eastern shores of Australia.\\n\\nCaptain Baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown\\nreef; he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts\\nshot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air\\nsome 150 feet. So, unless this reef was subject to the intermittent\\neruptions of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had fair and honest\\ndealings with some aquatic mammal, until then unknown, that could\\nspurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam.\\n\\nSimilar events were likewise observed in Pacific seas, on July 23 of\\nthe same year, by the Christopher Columbus from the West India &\\nPacific Steam Navigation Co. Consequently, this extraordinary cetacean\\ncould transfer itself from one locality to another with startling\\nswiftness, since within an interval of just three days, the Governor\\nHigginson and the Christopher Columbus had observed it at two\\npositions on the charts separated by a distance of more than 700\\nnautical leagues.\\n\\nFifteen days later and 2,000 leagues farther, the Helvetia from the\\nCompagnie Nationale and the Shannon from the Royal Mail line, running\\non opposite tacks in that part of the Atlantic lying between the\\nUnited States and Europe, respectively signaled each other that the\\nmonster had been sighted in latitude 42 degrees 15’ north and\\nlongitude 60 degrees 35’ west of the meridian of Greenwich. From their\\nsimultaneous observations, they were able to estimate the mammal’s\\nminimum length at more than 350 English feet;* this was because both\\nthe Shannon and the Helvetia were of smaller dimensions, although each\\nmeasured 100 meters stem to stern. Now then, the biggest whales, those\\nrorqual whales that frequent the waterways of the Aleutian Islands,\\nhave never exceeded a length of 56 meters—if they reach even that.\\n\\n*Author’s Note: About 106 meters. An English foot is only 30.4\\n centimeters.\\n\\nOne after another, reports arrived that would profoundly affect public\\nopinion: new observations taken by the transatlantic liner Pereire,\\nthe Inman line’s Etna running afoul of the monster, an official report\\ndrawn up by officers on the French frigate Normandy, dead-earnest\\nreckonings obtained by the general staff of Commodore Fitz-James\\naboard the Lord Clyde. In lighthearted countries, people joked about\\nthis phenomenon, but such serious, practical countries as England,\\nAmerica, and Germany were deeply concerned.\\n\\nIn every big city the monster was the latest rage; they sang about it\\nin the coffee houses, they ridiculed it in the newspapers, they\\ndramatized it in the theaters. The tabloids found it a fine\\nopportunity for hatching all sorts of hoaxes. In those newspapers\\nshort of copy, you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary\\ncreature, from “Moby Dick,” that dreadful white whale from the High\\nArctic regions, to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine\\na 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths. They even reprinted\\nreports from ancient times: the views of Aristotle and Pliny accepting\\nthe existence of such monsters, then the Norwegian stories of Bishop\\nPontoppidan, the narratives of Paul Egede, and finally the reports of\\nCaptain Harrington—whose good faith is above suspicion—in which he\\nclaims he saw, while aboard the Castilian in 1857, one of those\\nenormous serpents that, until then, had frequented only the seas of\\nFrance’s old extremist newspaper, The Constitutionalist.\\n\\nAn interminable debate then broke out between believers and skeptics\\nin the scholarly societies and scientific journals. The “monster\\nquestion” inflamed all minds. During this memorable campaign,\\njournalists making a profession of science battled with those making a\\nprofession of wit, spilling waves of ink and some of them even two or\\nthree drops of blood, since they went from sea serpents to the most\\noffensive personal remarks.\\n\\nFor six months the war seesawed. With inexhaustible zest, the popular\\npress took potshots at feature articles from the Geographic Institute\\nof Brazil, the Royal Academy of Science in Berlin, the British\\nAssociation, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., at\\ndiscussions in The Indian Archipelago, in Cosmos published by Father\\nMoigno, in Petermann’s Mittheilungen,* and at scientific chronicles in\\nthe great French and foreign newspapers. When the monster’s detractors\\ncited a saying by the botanist Linnaeus that “nature doesn’t make\\nleaps,” witty writers in the popular periodicals parodied it,\\nmaintaining in essence that “nature doesn’t make lunatics,” and\\nordering their contemporaries never to give the lie to nature by\\nbelieving in krakens, sea serpents, “Moby Dicks,” and other all-out\\nefforts from drunken seamen. Finally, in a much-feared satirical\\njournal, an article by its most popular columnist finished off the\\nmonster for good, spurning it in the style of Hippolytus repulsing the\\namorous advances of his stepmother Phaedra, and giving the creature\\nits quietus amid a universal burst of laughter. Wit had defeated\\nscience.\\n\\n*German: “Bulletin.” Ed.\\n\\nDuring the first months of the year 1867, the question seemed to be\\nburied, and it didn’t seem due for resurrection, when new facts were\\nbrought to the public’s attention. But now it was no longer an issue\\nof a scientific problem to be solved, but a quite real and serious\\ndanger to be avoided. The question took an entirely new turn. The\\nmonster again became an islet, rock, or reef, but a runaway reef,\\nunfixed and elusive.\\n\\nOn March 5, 1867, the Moravian from the Montreal Ocean Co., lying\\nduring the night in latitude 27 degrees 30’ and longitude 72 degrees\\n15’, ran its starboard quarter afoul of a rock marked on no charts of\\nthese waterways. Under the combined efforts of wind and 400-horsepower\\nsteam, it was traveling at a speed of thirteen knots. Without the high\\nquality of its hull, the Moravian would surely have split open from\\nthis collision and gone down together with those 237 passengers it was\\nbringing back from Canada.\\n\\nThis accident happened around five o’clock in the morning, just as day\\nwas beginning to break. The officers on watch rushed to the craft’s\\nstern. They examined the ocean with the most scrupulous care. They saw\\nnothing except a strong eddy breaking three cable lengths out, as if\\nthose sheets of water had been violently churned. The site’s exact\\nbearings were taken, and the Moravian continued on course apparently\\nundamaged. Had it run afoul of an underwater rock or the wreckage of\\nsome enormous derelict ship? They were unable to say. But when they\\nexamined its undersides in the service yard, they discovered that part\\nof its keel had been smashed.\\n\\nThis occurrence, extremely serious in itself, might perhaps have been\\nforgotten like so many others, if three weeks later it hadn’t been\\nreenacted under identical conditions. Only, thanks to the nationality\\nof the ship victimized by this new ramming, and thanks to the\\nreputation of the company to which this ship belonged, the event\\ncaused an immense uproar.\\n\\nNo one is unaware of the name of that famous English shipowner,\\nCunard. In 1840 this shrewd industrialist founded a postal service\\nbetween Liverpool and Halifax, featuring three wooden ships with\\n400-horsepower paddle wheels and a burden of 1,162 metric tons. Eight\\nyears later, the company’s assets were increased by four\\n650-horsepower ships at 1,820 metric tons, and in two more years, by\\ntwo other vessels of still greater power and tonnage. In 1853 the\\nCunard Co., whose mail-carrying charter had just been renewed,\\nsuccessively added to its assets the Arabia, the Persia, the China,\\nthe Scotia, the Java, and the Russia, all ships of top speed and,\\nafter the Great Eastern, the biggest ever to plow the seas. So in 1867\\nthis company owned twelve ships, eight with paddle wheels and four\\nwith propellers.\\n\\nIf I give these highly condensed details, it is so everyone can fully\\nunderstand the importance of this maritime transportation company,\\nknown the world over for its shrewd management. No transoceanic\\nnavigational undertaking has been conducted with more ability, no\\nbusiness dealings have been crowned with greater success. In\\ntwenty-six years Cunard ships have made 2,000 Atlantic crossings\\nwithout so much as a voyage canceled, a delay recorded, a man, a\\ncraft, or even a letter lost. Accordingly, despite strong competition\\nfrom France, passengers still choose the Cunard line in preference to\\nall others, as can be seen in a recent survey of official\\ndocuments. Given this, no one will be astonished at the uproar\\nprovoked by this accident involving one of its finest steamers.\\n\\nOn April 13, 1867, with a smooth sea and a moderate breeze, the Scotia\\nlay in longitude 15 degrees 12’ and latitude 45 degrees 37’. It was\\ntraveling at a speed of 13.43 knots under the thrust of its\\n1,000-horsepower engines. Its paddle wheels were churning the sea with\\nperfect steadiness. It was then drawing 6.7 meters of water and\\ndisplacing 6,624 cubic meters.\\n\\nAt 4:17 in the afternoon, during a high tea for passengers gathered in\\nthe main lounge, a collision occurred, scarcely noticeable on the\\nwhole, affecting the Scotia’s hull in that quarter a little astern of\\nits port paddle wheel.\\n\\nThe Scotia hadn’t run afoul of something, it had been fouled, and by a\\ncutting or perforating instrument rather than a blunt one. This\\nencounter seemed so minor that nobody on board would have been\\ndisturbed by it, had it not been for the shouts of crewmen in the\\nhold, who climbed on deck yelling:\\n\\n“We’re sinking! We’re sinking!”\\n\\nAt first the passengers were quite frightened, but Captain Anderson\\nhastened to reassure them. In fact, there could be no immediate\\ndanger. Divided into seven compartments by watertight bulkheads, the\\nScotia could brave any leak with impunity.\\n\\nCaptain Anderson immediately made his way into the hold. He discovered\\nthat the fifth compartment had been invaded by the sea, and the speed\\nof this invasion proved that the leak was considerable. Fortunately\\nthis compartment didn’t contain the boilers, because their furnaces\\nwould have been abruptly extinguished.\\n\\nCaptain Anderson called an immediate halt, and one of his sailors\\ndived down to assess the damage. Within moments they had located a\\nhole two meters in width on the steamer’s underside. Such a leak could\\nnot be patched, and with its paddle wheels half swamped, the Scotia\\nhad no choice but to continue its voyage. By then it lay 300 miles\\nfrom Cape Clear, and after three days of delay that filled Liverpool\\nwith acute anxiety, it entered the company docks.\\n\\nThe engineers then proceeded to inspect the Scotia, which had been put\\nin dry dock. They couldn’t believe their eyes. Two and a half meters\\nbelow its waterline, there gaped a symmetrical gash in the shape of an\\nisosceles triangle. This breach in the sheet iron was so perfectly\\nformed, no punch could have done a cleaner job of it. Consequently, it\\nmust have been produced by a perforating tool of uncommon\\ntoughness—plus, after being launched with prodigious power and then\\npiercing four centimeters of sheet iron, this tool had needed to\\nwithdraw itself by a backward motion truly inexplicable.\\n\\nThis was the last straw, and it resulted in arousing public passions\\nall over again. Indeed, from this moment on, any maritime casualty\\nwithout an established cause was charged to the monster’s\\naccount. This outrageous animal had to shoulder responsibility for all\\nderelict vessels, whose numbers are unfortunately considerable, since\\nout of those 3,000 ships whose losses are recorded annually at the\\nmarine insurance bureau, the figure for steam or sailing ships\\nsupposedly lost with all hands, in the absence of any news, amounts to\\nat least 200!\\n\\nNow then, justly or unjustly, it was the “monster” who stood accused\\nof their disappearance; and since, thanks to it, travel between the\\nvarious continents had become more and more dangerous, the public\\nspoke up and demanded straight out that, at all cost, the seas be\\npurged of this fearsome cetacean.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\nThe Pros and Cons\\n\\n\\nDURING THE PERIOD in which these developments were occurring, I had\\nreturned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore the\\nNebraska badlands in the United States. In my capacity as Assistant\\nProfessor at the Paris Museum of Natural History, I had been attached\\nto this expedition by the French government. After spending six months\\nin Nebraska, I arrived in New York laden with valuable collections\\nnear the end of March. My departure for France was set for early\\nMay. In the meantime, then, I was busy classifying my mineralogical,\\nbotanical, and zoological treasures when that incident took place with\\nthe Scotia.\\n\\nI was perfectly abreast of this question, which was the big news of\\nthe day, and how could I not have been? I had read and reread every\\nAmerican and European newspaper without being any farther along. This\\nmystery puzzled me. Finding it impossible to form any views, I drifted\\nfrom one extreme to the other. Something was out there, that much was\\ncertain, and any doubting Thomas was invited to place his finger on\\nthe Scotia’s wound.\\n\\nWhen I arrived in New York, the question was at the boiling point. The\\nhypothesis of a drifting islet or an elusive reef, put forward by\\npeople not quite in their right minds, was completely eliminated. And\\nindeed, unless this reef had an engine in its belly, how could it move\\nabout with such prodigious speed?\\n\\nAlso discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other\\nenormous wreckage, and again because of this speed of movement.\\n\\nSo only two possible solutions to the question were left, creating two\\nvery distinct groups of supporters: on one side, those favoring a\\nmonster of colossal strength; on the other, those favoring an\\n“underwater boat” of tremendous motor power.\\n\\nNow then, although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible, it\\ncouldn’t stand up to inquiries conducted in both the New World and the\\nOld. That a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal\\nwas less than probable. Where and when had he built it, and how could\\nhe have built it in secret?\\n\\nOnly some government could own such an engine of destruction, and in\\nthese disaster-filled times, when men tax their ingenuity to build\\nincreasingly powerful aggressive weapons, it was possible that,\\nunknown to the rest of the world, some nation could have been testing\\nsuch a fearsome machine. The Chassepot rifle led to the torpedo, and\\nthe torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram, which in turn\\nwill lead to the world putting its foot down. At least I hope it will.\\n\\nBut this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal\\ndenials from the various governments. Since the public interest was at\\nstake and transoceanic travel was suffering, the sincerity of these\\ngovernments could not be doubted. Besides, how could the assembly of\\nthis underwater boat have escaped public notice? Keeping a secret\\nunder such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual,\\nand certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under\\nconstant surveillance by rival powers.\\n\\nSo, after inquiries conducted in England, France, Russia, Prussia,\\nSpain, Italy, America, and even Turkey, the hypothesis of an\\nunderwater Monitor was ultimately rejected.\\n\\nAnd so the monster surfaced again, despite the endless witticisms\\nheaped on it by the popular press, and the human imagination soon got\\ncaught up in the most ridiculous ichthyological fantasies.\\n\\nAfter I arrived in New York, several people did me the honor of\\nconsulting me on the phenomenon in question. In France I had published\\na two-volume work, in quarto, entitled The Mysteries of the Great\\nOcean Depths. Well received in scholarly circles, this book had\\nestablished me as a specialist in this pretty obscure field of natural\\nhistory. My views were in demand. As long as I could deny the reality\\nof the business, I confined myself to a flat “no comment.” But soon,\\npinned to the wall, I had to explain myself straight out. And in this\\nvein, “the honorable Pierre Aronnax, Professor at the Paris Museum,”\\nwas summoned by The New York Herald to formulate his views no matter\\nwhat.\\n\\nI complied. Since I could no longer hold my tongue, I let it wag. I\\ndiscussed the question in its every aspect, both political and\\nscientific, and this is an excerpt from the well-padded article I\\npublished in the issue of April 30.\\n\\n“Therefore,” I wrote, “after examining these different hypotheses one\\nby one, we are forced, every other supposition having been refuted, to\\naccept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal.\\n\\n“The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us. No\\nsoundings have been able to reach them. What goes on in those distant\\ndepths? What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve\\nor fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? What is the\\nconstitution of these animals? It’s almost beyond conjecture.\\n\\n“However, the solution to this problem submitted to me can take the\\nform of a choice between two alternatives.\\n\\n“Either we know every variety of creature populating our planet, or we\\ndo not.\\n\\n“If we do not know every one of them, if nature still keeps\\nichthyological secrets from us, nothing is more admissible than to\\naccept the existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new\\ngenera, animals with a basically ‘cast-iron’ constitution that inhabit\\nstrata beyond the reach of our soundings, and which some development\\nor other, an urge or a whim if you prefer, can bring to the upper\\nlevel of the ocean for long intervals.\\n\\n“If, on the other hand, we do know every living species, we must look\\nfor the animal in question among those marine creatures already\\ncataloged, and in this event I would be inclined to accept the\\nexistence of a giant narwhale.\\n\\n“The common narwhale, or sea unicorn, often reaches a length of sixty\\nfeet. Increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold, then give this\\ncetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its\\noffensive weapons, and you have the animal we’re looking for. It would\\nhave the proportions determined by the officers of the Shannon, the\\ninstrument needed to perforate the Scotia, and the power to pierce a\\nsteamer’s hull.\\n\\n“In essence, the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword, or\\nlance, as certain naturalists have expressed it. It’s a king-sized\\ntooth as hard as steel. Some of these teeth have been found buried in\\nthe bodies of baleen whales, which the narwhale attacks with\\ninvariable success. Others have been wrenched, not without difficulty,\\nfrom the undersides of vessels that narwhales have pierced clean\\nthrough, as a gimlet pierces a wine barrel. The museum at the Faculty\\nof Medicine in Paris owns one of these tusks with a length of 2.25\\nmeters and a width at its base of forty-eight centimeters!\\n\\n“All right then! Imagine this weapon to be ten times stronger and the\\nanimal ten times more powerful, launch it at a speed of twenty miles\\nper hour, multiply its mass times its velocity, and you get just the\\ncollision we need to cause the specified catastrophe.\\n\\n“So, until information becomes more abundant, I plump for a sea\\nunicorn of colossal dimensions, no longer armed with a mere lance but\\nwith an actual spur, like ironclad frigates or those warships called\\n‘rams,’ whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously.\\n\\n“This inexplicable phenomenon is thus explained away—unless it’s\\nsomething else entirely, which, despite everything that has been\\nsighted, studied, explored and experienced, is still possible!”\\n\\nThese last words were cowardly of me; but as far as I could, I wanted\\nto protect my professorial dignity and not lay myself open to laughter\\nfrom the Americans, who when they do laugh, laugh raucously. I had\\nleft myself a loophole. Yet deep down, I had accepted the existence of\\n“the monster.”\\n\\nMy article was hotly debated, causing a fine old uproar. It rallied a\\nnumber of supporters. Moreover, the solution it proposed allowed for\\nfree play of the imagination. The human mind enjoys impressive visions\\nof unearthly creatures. Now then, the sea is precisely their best\\nmedium, the only setting suitable for the breeding and growing of such\\ngiants—next to which such land animals as elephants or rhinoceroses\\nare mere dwarves. The liquid masses support the largest known species\\nof mammals and perhaps conceal mollusks of incomparable size or\\ncrustaceans too frightful to contemplate, such as 100-meter lobsters\\nor crabs weighing 200 metric tons! Why not? Formerly, in prehistoric\\ndays, land animals (quadrupeds, apes, reptiles, birds) were built on a\\ngigantic scale. Our Creator cast them using a colossal mold that time\\nhas gradually made smaller. With its untold depths, couldn’t the sea\\nkeep alive such huge specimens of life from another age, this sea that\\nnever changes while the land masses undergo almost continuous\\nalteration? Couldn’t the heart of the ocean hide the last-remaining\\nvarieties of these titanic species, for whom years are centuries and\\ncenturies millennia?\\n\\nBut I mustn’t let these fantasies run away with me! Enough of these\\nfairy tales that time has changed for me into harsh realities. I\\nrepeat: opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon,\\nand the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious\\ncreature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent.\\n\\nYet if some saw it purely as a scientific problem to be solved, more\\npractical people, especially in America and England, were determined\\nto purge the ocean of this daunting monster, to insure the safety of\\ntransoceanic travel. The industrial and commercial newspapers dealt\\nwith the question chiefly from this viewpoint. The Shipping &\\nMercantile Gazette, the Lloyd’s List, France’s Packetboat and Maritime\\n& Colonial Review, all the rags devoted to insurance companies—who\\nthreatened to raise their premium rates—were unanimous on this point.\\n\\nPublic opinion being pronounced, the States of the Union were the\\nfirst in the field. In New York preparations were under way for an\\nexpedition designed to chase this narwhale. A high-speed frigate, the\\nAbraham Lincoln, was fitted out for putting to sea as soon as\\npossible. The naval arsenals were unlocked for Commander Farragut, who\\npressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate.\\n\\nBut, as it always happens, just when a decision had been made to chase\\nthe monster, the monster put in no further appearances. For two months\\nnobody heard a word about it. Not a single ship encountered\\nit. Apparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven\\naround it. People were constantly babbling about the creature, even\\nvia the Atlantic Cable! Accordingly, the wags claimed that this\\nslippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making the\\nmost of it.\\n\\nSo the frigate was equipped for a far-off voyage and armed with\\nfearsome fishing gear, but nobody knew where to steer it. And\\nimpatience grew until, on June 2, word came that the Tampico, a\\nsteamer on the San Francisco line sailing from California to Shanghai,\\nhad sighted the animal again, three weeks before in the northerly seas\\nof the Pacific.\\n\\nThis news caused intense excitement. Not even a 24-hour breather was\\ngranted to Commander Farragut. His provisions were loaded on\\nboard. His coal bunkers were overflowing. Not a crewman was missing\\nfrom his post. To cast off, he needed only to fire and stoke his\\nfurnaces! Half a day’s delay would have been unforgivable! But\\nCommander Farragut wanted nothing more than to go forth.\\n\\nI received a letter three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left its\\nBrooklyn pier;* the letter read as follows:\\n\\n*Author’s Note: A pier is a type of wharf expressly set aside for an\\n individual vessel.\\n\\n  Pierre Aronnax\\n  Professor at the Paris Museum\\n  Fifth Avenue Hotel\\n  New York\\n\\n  Sir:\\n\\n  If you would like to join the expedition on the Abraham Lincoln, the\\n  government of the Union will be pleased to regard you as France’s\\n  representative in this undertaking. Commander Farragut has a cabin at\\n  your disposal.\\n\\n  Very cordially yours,\\n\\n  J. B. HOBSON,\\n  Secretary of the Navy.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\nAs Master Wishes\\n\\n\\nTHREE SECONDS before the arrival of J. B. Hobson’s letter, I no more\\ndreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the Northwest\\nPassage. Three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable\\nSecretary of the Navy, I understood at last that my true vocation, my\\nsole purpose in life, was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid\\nthe world of it.\\n\\nEven so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and\\nbadly needing a rest. I wanted nothing more than to see my country\\nagain, my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens, my\\ndearly beloved collections! But now nothing could hold me back. I\\nforgot everything else, and without another thought of exhaustion,\\nfriends, or collections, I accepted the American government’s offer.\\n\\n“Besides,” I mused, “all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn\\nmay be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France! That\\nfine animal may even let itself be captured in European seas—as a\\npersonal favor to me—and I’ll bring back to the Museum of Natural\\nHistory at least half a meter of its ivory lance!”\\n\\nBut in the meantime I would have to look for this narwhale in the\\nnorthern Pacific Ocean; which meant returning to France by way of the\\nAntipodes.\\n\\n“Conseil!” I called in an impatient voice.\\n\\nConseil was my manservant. A devoted lad who went with me on all my\\njourneys; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who\\nreturned the compliment; a born stoic, punctilious on principle,\\nhabitually hardworking, rarely startled by life’s surprises, very\\nskillful with his hands, efficient in his every duty, and despite his\\nhaving a name that means “counsel,” never giving advice—not even the\\nunsolicited kind!\\n\\nFrom rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the\\nBotanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two. In Conseil\\nI had a seasoned specialist in biological classification, an\\nenthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole\\nladder of branches, groups, classes, subclasses, orders, families,\\ngenera, subgenera, species, and varieties. But there his science came\\nto a halt. Classifying was everything to him, so he knew nothing\\nelse. Well versed in the theory of classification, he was poorly\\nversed in its practical application, and I doubt that he could tell a\\nsperm whale from a baleen whale! And yet, what a fine, gallant lad!\\n\\nFor the past ten years, Conseil had gone with me wherever science\\nbeckoned. Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a\\njourney. Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any\\ncountry whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was. He\\nwent here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment. Moreover, he\\nenjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments, owned solid\\nmuscles, but hadn’t a nerve in him, not a sign of nerves—the mental\\ntype, I mean.\\n\\nThe lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer was\\nas fifteen is to twenty. Please forgive me for this underhanded way of\\nadmitting I had turned forty.\\n\\nBut Conseil had one flaw. He was a fanatic on formality, and he only\\naddressed me in the third person—to the point where it got tiresome.\\n\\n“Conseil!” I repeated, while feverishly beginning my preparations for\\ndeparture.\\n\\nTo be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad. Ordinarily, I never\\nasked whether or not it suited him to go with me on my journeys; but\\nthis time an expedition was at issue that could drag on indefinitely,\\na hazardous undertaking whose purpose was to hunt an animal that could\\nsink a frigate as easily as a walnut shell! There was good reason to\\nstop and think, even for the world’s most emotionless man. What would\\nConseil say?\\n\\n“Conseil!” I called a third time.\\n\\nConseil appeared.\\n\\n“Did master summon me?” he said, entering.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy. Get my things ready, get yours ready. We’re departing in\\ntwo hours.”\\n\\n“As master wishes,” Conseil replied serenely.\\n\\n“We haven’t a moment to lose. Pack as much into my trunk as you can,\\nmy traveling kit, my suits, shirts, and socks, don’t bother counting,\\njust squeeze it all in—and hurry!”\\n\\n“What about master’s collections?” Conseil ventured to observe.\\n\\n“We’ll deal with them later.”\\n\\n“What! The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus,\\nand master’s other fossil skeletons?”\\n\\n“The hotel will keep them for us.”\\n\\n“What about master’s live babirusa?”\\n\\n“They’ll feed it during our absence. Anyhow, we’ll leave instructions\\nto ship the whole menagerie to France.”\\n\\n“Then we aren’t returning to Paris?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“Yes, we are . . . certainly . . . ,” I replied evasively, “but after\\nwe make a detour.”\\n\\n“Whatever detour master wishes.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s nothing really! A route slightly less direct, that’s\\nall. We’re leaving on the Abraham Lincoln.”\\n\\n“As master thinks best,” Conseil replied placidly.\\n\\n“You see, my friend, it’s an issue of the monster, the notorious\\nnarwhale. We’re going to rid the seas of it! The author of a\\ntwo-volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths\\nhas no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut. It’s a\\nglorious mission but also a dangerous one! We don’t know where it will\\ntake us! These beasts can be quite unpredictable! But we’re going just\\nthe same! We have a commander who’s game for anything!”\\n\\n“What master does, I’ll do,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“But think it over, because I don’t want to hide anything from\\nyou. This is one of those voyages from which people don’t always come\\nback!”\\n\\n“As master wishes.”\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later, our trunks were ready. Conseil did them in\\na flash, and I was sure the lad hadn’t missed a thing, because he\\nclassified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals.\\n\\nThe hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the\\nmezzanine. I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor. I\\nsettled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a\\nconsiderable crowd. I left instructions for shipping my containers of\\nstuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France. I opened a line of\\ncredit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels, I\\njumped into a carriage.\\n\\nFor a fare of twenty francs, the vehicle went down Broadway to Union\\nSquare, took Fourth Ave. to its junction with Bowery St., turned into\\nKatrin St. and halted at Pier 34. There the Katrin ferry transferred\\nmen, horses, and carriage to Brooklyn, that great New York annex\\nlocated on the left bank of the East River, and in a few minutes we\\narrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln was vomiting\\ntorrents of black smoke from its two funnels.\\n\\nOur baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate. I\\nrushed aboard. I asked for Commander Farragut. One of the sailors led\\nme to the afterdeck, where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking\\nofficer who extended his hand to me.\\n\\n“Professor Pierre Aronnax?” he said to me.\\n\\n“The same,” I replied. “Commander Farragut?”\\n\\n“In person. Welcome aboard, professor. Your cabin is waiting for you.”\\n\\nI bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way, I was\\ntaken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.\\n\\nThe Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its\\nnew assignment. It was a high-speed frigate furnished with\\nsuperheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build\\nto seven atmospheres. Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln reached\\nan average speed of 18.3 miles per hour, a considerable speed but\\nstill not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean.\\n\\nThe frigate’s interior accommodations complemented its nautical\\nvirtues. I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the\\nstern and opened into the officers’ mess.\\n\\n“We’ll be quite comfortable here,” I told Conseil.\\n\\n“With all due respect to master,” Conseil replied, “as comfortable as\\na hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk.”\\n\\nI left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on\\ndeck to watch the preparations for getting under way.\\n\\nJust then Commander Farragut was giving orders to cast off the last\\nmoorings holding the Abraham Lincoln to its Brooklyn pier. And so if\\nI’d been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less, the frigate\\nwould have gone without me, and I would have missed out on this\\nunearthly, extraordinary, and inconceivable expedition, whose true\\nstory might well meet with some skepticism.\\n\\nBut Commander Farragut didn’t want to waste a single day, or even a\\nsingle hour, in making for those seas where the animal had just been\\nsighted. He summoned his engineer.\\n\\n“Are we up to pressure?” he asked the man.\\n\\n“Aye, sir,” the engineer replied.\\n\\n“Go ahead, then!” Commander Farragut called.\\n\\nAt this order, which was relayed to the engine by means of a\\ncompressed-air device, the mechanics activated the start-up\\nwheel. Steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves. Long horizontal\\npistons groaned and pushed the tie rods of the drive shaft. The blades\\nof the propeller churned the waves with increasing speed, and the\\nAbraham Lincoln moved out majestically amid a spectator-laden escort\\nof some 100 ferries and tenders.*\\n\\n*Author’s Note: Tenders are small steamboats that assist the big\\n liners.\\n\\nThe wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering the East\\nRiver, were crowded with curiosity seekers. Departing from 500,000\\nthroats, three cheers burst forth in succession. Thousands of\\nhandkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses, hailing\\nthe Abraham\\n\\nLincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip of\\nthe long peninsula that forms New York City.\\n\\nThe frigate then went along the New Jersey coast—the wonderful right\\nbank of this river, all loaded down with country homes—and passed by\\nthe forts to salutes from their biggest cannons. The Abraham Lincoln\\nreplied by three times lowering and hoisting the American flag, whose\\nthirty-nine stars gleamed from the gaff of the mizzen sail; then,\\nchanging speed to take the buoy-marked channel that curved into the\\ninner bay formed by the spit of Sandy Hook, it hugged this\\nsand-covered strip of land where thousands of spectators acclaimed us\\none more time.\\n\\nThe escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only\\nleft us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal lights\\nmark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.\\n\\nThree o’clock then sounded. The harbor pilot went down into his dinghy\\nand rejoined a little schooner waiting for him to leeward. The\\nfurnaces were stoked; the propeller churned the waves more swiftly;\\nthe frigate skirted the flat, yellow coast of Long Island; and at\\neight o’clock in the evening, after the lights of Fire Island had\\nvanished into the northwest, we ran at full steam onto the dark waters\\nof the Atlantic.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nNed Land\\n\\n\\nCOMMANDER FARRAGUT was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he\\ncommanded. His ship and he were one. He was its very soul. On the\\ncetacean question no doubts arose in his mind, and he didn’t allow the\\nanimal’s existence to be disputed aboard his vessel. He believed in it\\nas certain pious women believe in the leviathan from the Book of\\nJob—out of faith, not reason. The monster existed, and he had vowed to\\nrid the seas of it. The man was a sort of Knight of Rhodes, a\\nlatter-day Sir Dieudonné of Gozo, on his way to fight an encounter\\nwith the dragon devastating the island. Either Commander Farragut\\nwould slay the narwhale, or the narwhale would slay Commander\\nFarragut. No middle of the road for these two.\\n\\nThe ship’s officers shared the views of their leader. They could be\\nheard chatting, discussing, arguing, calculating the different chances\\nof an encounter, and observing the vast expanse of the\\nocean. Voluntary watches from the crosstrees of the topgallant sail\\nwere self-imposed by more than one who would have cursed such toil\\nunder any other circumstances. As often as the sun swept over its\\ndaily arc, the masts were populated with sailors whose feet itched and\\ncouldn’t hold still on the planking of the deck below! And the Abraham\\nLincoln’s stempost hadn’t even cut the suspected waters of the\\nPacific.\\n\\nAs for the crew, they only wanted to encounter the unicorn, harpoon\\nit, haul it on board, and carve it up. They surveyed the sea with\\nscrupulous care. Besides, Commander Farragut had mentioned that a\\ncertain sum of $2,000.00 was waiting for the man who first sighted the\\nanimal, be he cabin boy or sailor, mate or officer. I’ll let the\\nreader decide whether eyes got proper exercise aboard the Abraham\\nLincoln.\\n\\nAs for me, I didn’t lag behind the others and I yielded to no one my\\nshare in these daily observations. Our frigate would have had\\nfivescore good reasons for renaming itself the Argus, after that\\nmythological beast with 100 eyes! The lone rebel among us was Conseil,\\nwho seemed utterly uninterested in the question exciting us and was\\nout of step with the general enthusiasm on board.\\n\\nAs I said, Commander Farragut had carefully equipped his ship with all\\nthe gear needed to fish for a gigantic cetacean. No whaling vessel\\ncould have been better armed. We had every known mechanism, from the\\nhand-hurled harpoon, to the blunderbuss firing barbed arrows, to the\\nduck gun with exploding bullets. On the forecastle was mounted the\\nlatest model breech-loading cannon, very heavy of barrel and narrow of\\nbore, a weapon that would figure in the Universal Exhibition of\\n1867. Made in America, this valuable instrument could fire a\\nfour-kilogram conical projectile an average distance of sixteen\\nkilometers without the least bother.\\n\\nSo the Abraham Lincoln wasn’t lacking in means of destruction. But it\\nhad better still. It had Ned Land, the King of Harpooners.\\n\\nGifted with uncommon manual ability, Ned Land was a Canadian who had\\nno equal in his dangerous trade. Dexterity, coolness, bravery, and\\ncunning were virtues he possessed to a high degree, and it took a\\ntruly crafty baleen whale or an exceptionally astute sperm whale to\\nelude the thrusts of his harpoon.\\n\\nNed Land was about forty years old. A man of great height—over six\\nEnglish feet—he was powerfully built, serious in manner, not very\\nsociable, sometimes headstrong, and quite ill-tempered when\\ncrossed. His looks caught the attention, and above all the strength of\\nhis gaze, which gave a unique emphasis to his facial appearance.\\n\\nCommander Farragut, to my thinking, had made a wise move in hiring on\\nthis man. With his eye and his throwing arm, he was worth the whole\\ncrew all by himself. I can do no better than to compare him with a\\npowerful telescope that could double as a cannon always ready to fire.\\n\\nTo say Canadian is to say French, and as unsociable as Ned Land was, I\\nmust admit he took a definite liking to me. No doubt it was my\\nnationality that attracted him. It was an opportunity for him to\\nspeak, and for me to hear, that old Rabelaisian dialect still used in\\nsome Canadian provinces. The harpooner’s family originated in Quebec,\\nand they were already a line of bold fishermen back in the days when\\nthis town still belonged to France.\\n\\nLittle by little Ned developed a taste for chatting, and I loved\\nhearing the tales of his adventures in the polar seas. He described\\nhis fishing trips and his battles with great natural lyricism. His\\ntales took on the form of an epic poem, and I felt I was hearing some\\nCanadian Homer reciting his Iliad of the High Arctic regions.\\n\\nI’m writing of this bold companion as I currently know him. Because\\nwe’ve become old friends, united in that permanent comradeship born\\nand cemented during only the most frightful crises! Ah, my gallant\\nNed! I ask only to live 100 years more, the longer to remember you!\\n\\nAnd now, what were Ned Land’s views on this question of a marine\\nmonster? I must admit that he flatly didn’t believe in the unicorn,\\nand alone on board, he didn’t share the general conviction. He avoided\\neven dealing with the subject, for which one day I felt compelled to\\ntake him to task.\\n\\nDuring the magnificent evening of June 25—in other words, three weeks\\nafter our departure—the frigate lay abreast of Cabo Blanco, thirty\\nmiles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia. We had crossed the Tropic\\nof Capricorn, and the Strait of Magellan opened less than 700 miles to\\nthe south. Before eight days were out, the Abraham Lincoln would plow\\nthe waves of the Pacific.\\n\\nSeated on the afterdeck, Ned Land and I chatted about one thing and\\nanother, staring at that mysterious sea whose depths to this day are\\nbeyond the reach of human eyes. Quite naturally, I led our\\nconversation around to the giant unicorn, and I weighed our\\nexpedition’s various chances for success or failure. Then, seeing that\\nNed just let me talk without saying much himself, I pressed him more\\nclosely.\\n\\n“Ned,” I asked him, “how can you still doubt the reality of this\\ncetacean we’re after? Do you have any particular reasons for being so\\nskeptical?”\\n\\nThe harpooner stared at me awhile before replying, slapped his broad\\nforehead in one of his standard gestures, closed his eyes as if to\\ncollect himself, and finally said:\\n\\n“Just maybe, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“But Ned, you’re a professional whaler, a man familiar with all the\\ngreat marine mammals—your mind should easily accept this hypothesis of\\nan enormous cetacean, and you ought to be the last one to doubt it\\nunder these circumstances!”\\n\\n“That’s just where you’re mistaken, professor,” Ned replied. “The\\ncommon man may still believe in fabulous comets crossing outer space,\\nor in prehistoric monsters living at the earth’s core, but astronomers\\nand geologists don’t swallow such fairy tales. It’s the same with\\nwhalers. I’ve chased plenty of cetaceans, I’ve harpooned a good\\nnumber, I’ve killed several. But no matter how powerful and well armed\\nthey were, neither their tails or their tusks could puncture the\\nsheet-iron plates of a steamer.”\\n\\n“Even so, Ned, people mention vessels that narwhale tusks have run\\nclean through.”\\n\\n“Wooden ships maybe,” the Canadian replied. “But I’ve never seen the\\nlike. So till I have proof to the contrary, I’ll deny that baleen\\nwhales, sperm whales, or unicorns can do any such thing.”\\n\\n“Listen to me, Ned—”\\n\\n“No, no, professor. I’ll go along with anything you want except\\nthat. Some gigantic devilfish maybe . . . ?”\\n\\n“Even less likely, Ned. The devilfish is merely a mollusk, and even\\nthis name hints at its semiliquid flesh, because it’s Latin meaning\\nsoft one. The devilfish doesn’t belong to the vertebrate branch, and\\neven if it were 500 feet long, it would still be utterly harmless to\\nships like the Scotia or the Abraham Lincoln. Consequently, the feats\\nof krakens or other monsters of that ilk must be relegated to the\\nrealm of fiction.”\\n\\n“So, Mr. Naturalist,” Ned Land continued in a bantering tone, “you’ll\\njust keep on believing in the existence of some enormous cetacean\\n. . . ?”\\n\\n“Yes, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction backed by factual logic. I\\nbelieve in the existence of a mammal with a powerful constitution,\\nbelonging to the vertebrate branch like baleen whales, sperm whales,\\nor dolphins, and armed with a tusk made of horn that has tremendous\\npenetrating power.”\\n\\n“Humph!” the harpooner put in, shaking his head with the attitude of a\\nman who doesn’t want to be convinced.\\n\\n“Note well, my fine Canadian,” I went on, “if such an animal exists,\\nif it lives deep in the ocean, if it frequents the liquid strata\\nlocated miles beneath the surface of the water, it needs to have a\\nconstitution so solid, it defies all comparison.”\\n\\n“And why this powerful constitution?” Ned asked.\\n\\n“Because it takes incalculable strength just to live in those deep\\nstrata and withstand their pressure.”\\n\\n“Oh really?” Ned said, tipping me a wink.\\n\\n“Oh really, and I can prove it to you with a few simple figures.”\\n\\n“Bosh!” Ned replied. “You can make figures do anything you want!”\\n\\n“In business, Ned, but not in mathematics. Listen to me. Let’s accept\\nthat the pressure of one atmosphere is represented by the pressure of\\na column of water thirty-two feet high. In reality, such a column of\\nwater wouldn’t be quite so high because here we’re dealing with salt\\nwater, which is denser than fresh water. Well then, when you dive\\nunder the waves, Ned, for every thirty-two feet of water above you,\\nyour body is tolerating the pressure of one more atmosphere, in other\\nwords, one more kilogram per each square centimeter on your body’s\\nsurface. So it follows that at 320 feet down, this pressure is equal\\nto ten atmospheres, to 100 atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and to 1,000\\natmospheres at 32,000 feet, that is, at about two and a half vertical\\nleagues down. Which is tantamount to saying that if you could reach\\nsuch a depth in the ocean, each square centimeter on your body’s\\nsurface would be experiencing 1,000 kilograms of pressure. Now, my\\ngallant Ned, do you know how many square centimeters you have on your\\nbodily surface?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the foggiest notion, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“About 17,000.”\\n\\n“As many as that?”\\n\\n“Yes, and since the atmosphere’s pressure actually weighs slightly\\nmore than one kilogram per square centimeter, your 17,000 square\\ncentimeters are tolerating 17,568 kilograms at this very moment.”\\n\\n“Without my noticing it?”\\n\\n“Without your noticing it. And if you aren’t crushed by so much\\npressure, it’s because the air penetrates the interior of your body\\nwith equal pressure. When the inside and outside pressures are in\\nperfect balance, they neutralize each other and allow you to tolerate\\nthem without discomfort. But in the water it’s another story.”\\n\\n“Yes, I see,” Ned replied, growing more interested. “Because the water\\nsurrounds me but doesn’t penetrate me.”\\n\\n“Precisely, Ned. So at thirty-two feet beneath the surface of the sea,\\nyou’ll undergo a pressure of 17,568 kilograms; at 320 feet, or ten\\ntimes greater pressure, it’s 175,680 kilograms; at 3,200 feet, or 100\\ntimes greater pressure, it’s 1,756,800 kilograms; finally, at 32,000\\nfeet, or 1,000 times greater pressure, it’s 17,568,000 kilograms; in\\nother words, you’d be squashed as flat as if you’d just been yanked\\nfrom between the plates of a hydraulic press!”\\n\\n“Fire and brimstone!” Ned put in.\\n\\n“All right then, my fine harpooner, if vertebrates several hundred\\nmeters long and proportionate in bulk live at such depths, their\\nsurface areas make up millions of square centimeters, and the pressure\\nthey undergo must be assessed in billions of kilograms. Calculate,\\nthen, how much resistance of bone structure and strength of\\nconstitution they’d need in order to withstand such pressures!”\\n\\n“They’d need to be manufactured,” Ned Land replied, “from sheet-iron\\nplates eight inches thick, like ironclad frigates.”\\n\\n“Right, Ned, and then picture the damage such a mass could inflict if\\nit were launched with the speed of an express train against a ship’s\\nhull.”\\n\\n“Yes . . . indeed . . . maybe,” the Canadian replied, staggered by\\nthese figures but still not willing to give in.\\n\\n“Well, have I convinced you?”\\n\\n“You’ve convinced me of one thing, Mr. Naturalist. That deep in the\\nsea, such animals would need to be just as strong as you say—if they\\nexist.”\\n\\n“But if they don’t exist, my stubborn harpooner, how do you explain\\nthe accident that happened to the Scotia?”\\n\\n“It’s maybe . . . ,” Ned said, hesitating.\\n\\n“Go on!”\\n\\n“Because . . . it just couldn’t be true!” the Canadian replied,\\nunconsciously echoing a famous catchphrase of the scientist Arago.\\n\\nBut this reply proved nothing, other than how bullheaded the harpooner\\ncould be. That day I pressed him no further. The Scotia’s accident was\\nundeniable. Its hole was real enough that it had to be plugged up, and\\nI don’t think a hole’s existence can be more emphatically proven. Now\\nthen, this hole didn’t make itself, and since it hadn’t resulted from\\nunderwater rocks or underwater machines, it must have been caused by\\nthe perforating tool of some animal.\\n\\nNow, for all the reasons put forward to this point, I believed that\\nthis animal was a member of the branch Vertebrata, class Mammalia,\\ngroup Pisciforma, and finally, order Cetacea. As for the family in\\nwhich it would be placed (baleen whale, sperm whale, or dolphin), the\\ngenus to which it belonged, and the species in which it would find its\\nproper home, these questions had to be left for later. To answer them\\ncalled for dissecting this unknown monster; to dissect it called for\\ncatching it; to catch it called for harpooning it—which was Ned Land’s\\nbusiness; to harpoon it called for sighting it—which was the crew’s\\nbusiness; and to sight it called for encountering it—which was a\\nchancy business.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nAt Random!\\n\\n\\nFOR SOME WHILE the voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was marked by no\\nincident. But one circumstance arose that displayed Ned Land’s\\nmarvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could place in\\nhim.\\n\\nOff the Falkland Islands on June 30, the frigate came in contact with\\na fleet of American whalers, and we learned that they hadn’t seen the\\nnarwhale. But one of them, the captain of the Monroe, knew that Ned\\nLand had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln and asked his help in\\nhunting a baleen whale that was in sight. Anxious to see Ned Land at\\nwork, Commander Farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the\\nMonroe. And the Canadian had such good luck that with a right-and-left\\nshot, he harpooned not one whale but two, striking the first straight\\nto the heart and catching the other after a few minutes’ chase!\\n\\nAssuredly, if the monster ever had to deal with Ned Land’s harpoon, I\\nwouldn’t bet on the monster.\\n\\nThe frigate sailed along the east coast of South America with\\nprodigious speed. By July 3 we were at the entrance to the Strait of\\nMagellan, abreast of Cabo de las Virgenes. But Commander Farragut was\\nunwilling to attempt this tortuous passageway and maneuvered instead\\nto double Cape Horn.\\n\\nThe crew sided with him unanimously. Indeed, were we likely to\\nencounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait? Many of our sailors\\nswore that the monster couldn’t negotiate this passageway simply\\nbecause “he’s too big for it!”\\n\\nNear three o’clock in the afternoon on July 6, fifteen miles south of\\nshore, the Abraham Lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip of\\nthe South American continent, that stray rock Dutch seamen had named\\nCape Horn after their hometown of Hoorn. Our course was set for the\\nnorthwest, and the next day our frigate’s propeller finally churned\\nthe waters of the Pacific.\\n\\n“Open your eyes! Open your eyes!” repeated the sailors of the Abraham\\nLincoln.\\n\\nAnd they opened amazingly wide. Eyes and spyglasses (a bit dazzled, it\\nis true, by the vista of $2,000.00) didn’t remain at rest for an\\ninstant. Day and night we observed the surface of the ocean, and those\\nwith nyctalopic eyes, whose ability to see in the dark increased their\\nchances by fifty percent, had an excellent shot at winning the prize.\\n\\nAs for me, I was hardly drawn by the lure of money and yet was far\\nfrom the least attentive on board. Snatching only a few minutes for\\nmeals and a few hours for sleep, come rain or come shine, I no longer\\nleft the ship’s deck. Sometimes bending over the forecastle railings,\\nsometimes leaning against the sternrail, I eagerly scoured that\\ncotton-colored wake that whitened the ocean as far as the eye could\\nsee! And how many times I shared the excitement of general staff and\\ncrew when some unpredictable whale lifted its blackish back above the\\nwaves. In an instant the frigate’s deck would become densely\\npopulated. The cowls over the companionways would vomit a torrent of\\nsailors and officers. With panting chests and anxious eyes, we each\\nwould observe the cetacean’s movements. I stared; I stared until I\\nnearly went blind from a worn-out retina, while Conseil, as stoic as\\never, kept repeating to me in a calm tone:\\n\\n“If master’s eyes would kindly stop bulging, master will see farther!”\\n\\nBut what a waste of energy! The Abraham Lincoln would change course\\nand race after the animal sighted, only to find an ordinary baleen\\nwhale or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid a chorus of\\ncurses!\\n\\nHowever, the weather held good. Our voyage was proceeding under the\\nmost favorable conditions. By then it was the bad season in these\\nsouthernmost regions, because July in this zone corresponds to our\\nJanuary in Europe; but the sea remained smooth and easily visible over\\na vast perimeter.\\n\\nNed Land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism; beyond his\\nspells on watch, he pretended that he never even looked at the surface\\nof the waves, at least while no whales were in sight. And yet the\\nmarvelous power of his vision could have performed yeoman service. But\\nthis stubborn Canadian spent eight hours out of every twelve reading\\nor sleeping in his cabin. A hundred times I chided him for his\\nunconcern.\\n\\n“Bah!” he replied. “Nothing’s out there, Professor Aronnax, and if\\nthere is some animal, what chance would we have of spotting it? Can’t\\nyou see we’re just wandering around at random? People say they’ve\\nsighted this slippery beast again in the Pacific high seas—I’m truly\\nwilling to believe it, but two months have already gone by since then,\\nand judging by your narwhale’s personality, it hates growing moldy\\nfrom hanging out too long in the same waterways! It’s blessed with a\\nterrific gift for getting around. Now, professor, you know even better\\nthan I that nature doesn’t violate good sense, and she wouldn’t give\\nsome naturally slow animal the ability to move swiftly if it hadn’t a\\nneed to use that talent. So if the beast does exist, it’s already long\\ngone!”\\n\\nI had no reply to this. Obviously we were just groping blindly. But\\nhow else could we go about it? All the same, our chances were\\nautomatically pretty limited. Yet everyone still felt confident of\\nsuccess, and not a sailor on board would have bet against the narwhale\\nappearing, and soon.\\n\\nOn July 20 we cut the Tropic of Capricorn at longitude 105 degrees,\\nand by the 27th of the same month, we had cleared the equator on the\\n110th meridian. These bearings determined, the frigate took a more\\ndecisive westward heading and tackled the seas of the central\\nPacific. Commander Farragut felt, and with good reason, that it was\\nbest to stay in deep waters and keep his distance from continents or\\nislands, whose neighborhoods the animal always seemed to avoid—“No\\ndoubt,” our bosun said, “because there isn’t enough water for him!” So\\nthe frigate kept well out when passing the Tuamotu, Marquesas, and\\nHawaiian Islands, then cut the Tropic of Cancer at longitude 132\\ndegrees and headed for the seas of China.\\n\\nWe were finally in the area of the monster’s latest antics! And in all\\nhonesty, shipboard conditions became life-threatening. Hearts were\\npounding hideously, gearing up for futures full of incurable\\naneurysms. The entire crew suffered from a nervous excitement that\\nit’s beyond me to describe. Nobody ate, nobody slept. Twenty times a\\nday some error in perception, or the optical illusions of some sailor\\nperched in the crosstrees, would cause intolerable anguish, and this\\nemotion, repeated twenty times over, kept us in a state of\\nirritability so intense that a reaction was bound to follow.\\n\\nAnd this reaction wasn’t long in coming. For three months, during\\nwhich each day seemed like a century, the Abraham Lincoln plowed all\\nthe northerly seas of the Pacific, racing after whales sighted,\\nabruptly veering off course, swerving sharply from one tack to\\nanother, stopping suddenly, putting on steam and reversing engines in\\nquick succession, at the risk of stripping its gears, and it didn’t\\nleave a single point unexplored from the beaches of Japan to the\\ncoasts of America. And we found nothing! Nothing except an immenseness\\nof deserted waves! Nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale, or\\nan underwater islet, or a derelict shipwreck, or a runaway reef, or\\nanything the least bit unearthly!\\n\\nSo the reaction set in. At first, discouragement took hold of people’s\\nminds, opening the door to disbelief. A new feeling appeared on board,\\nmade up of three-tenths shame and seven-tenths fury. The crew called\\nthemselves “out-and-out fools” for being hoodwinked by a fairy tale,\\nthen grew steadily more furious! The mountains of arguments amassed\\nover a year collapsed all at once, and each man now wanted only to\\ncatch up on his eating and sleeping, to make up for the time he had so\\nstupidly sacrificed.\\n\\nWith typical human fickleness, they jumped from one extreme to the\\nother. Inevitably, the most enthusiastic supporters of the undertaking\\nbecame its most energetic opponents. This reaction mounted upward from\\nthe bowels of the ship, from the quarters of the bunker hands to the\\nmessroom of the general staff; and for certain, if it hadn’t been for\\nCommander Farragut’s characteristic stubbornness, the frigate would\\nultimately have put back to that cape in the south.\\n\\nBut this futile search couldn’t drag on much longer. The Abraham\\nLincoln had done everything it could to succeed and had no reason to\\nblame itself. Never had the crew of an American naval craft shown more\\npatience and zeal; they weren’t responsible for this failure; there\\nwas nothing to do but go home.\\n\\nA request to this effect was presented to the commander. The commander\\nstood his ground. His sailors couldn’t hide their discontent, and\\ntheir work suffered because of it. I’m unwilling to say that there was\\nmutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of intransigence,\\nCommander Farragut, like Christopher Columbus before him, asked for a\\ngrace period of just three days more. After this three-day delay, if\\nthe monster hadn’t appeared, our helmsman would give three turns of\\nthe wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would chart a course toward\\nEuropean seas.\\n\\nThis promise was given on November 2. It had the immediate effect of\\nreviving the crew’s failing spirits. The ocean was observed with\\nrenewed care. Each man wanted one last look with which to sum up his\\nexperience. Spyglasses functioned with feverish energy. A supreme\\nchallenge had been issued to the giant narwhale, and the latter had no\\nacceptable excuse for ignoring this Summons to Appear!\\n\\nTwo days passed. The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam. On the\\noffchance that the animal might be found in these waterways, a\\nthousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its\\napathy. Enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake, to the great\\nsatisfaction, I must say, of assorted sharks. While the Abraham\\nLincoln heaved to, its longboats radiated in every direction around it\\nand didn’t leave a single point of the sea unexplored. But the evening\\nof November 4 arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved.\\n\\nAt noon the next day, November 5, the agreed-upon delay expired. After\\na position fix, true to his promise, Commander Farragut would have to\\nset his course for the southeast and leave the northerly regions of\\nthe Pacific decisively behind.\\n\\nBy then the frigate lay in latitude 31 degrees 15’ north and longitude\\n136 degrees 42’ east. The shores of Japan were less than 200 miles to\\nour leeward. Night was coming on. Eight o’clock had just struck. Huge\\nclouds covered the moon’s disk, then in its first quarter. The sea\\nundulated placidly beneath the frigate’s stempost.\\n\\nJust then I was in the bow, leaning over the starboard rail. Conseil,\\nstationed beside me, stared straight ahead. Roosting in the shrouds,\\nthe crew examined the horizon, which shrank and darkened little by\\nlittle. Officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night\\nglasses. Sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that\\ndarted between the fringes of two clouds. Then all traces of light\\nvanished into the darkness.\\n\\nObserving Conseil, I discovered that, just barely, the gallant lad had\\nfallen under the general influence. At least so I thought. Perhaps his\\nnerves were twitching with curiosity for the first time in history.\\n\\n“Come on, Conseil!” I told him. “Here’s your last chance to pocket\\nthat $2,000.00!”\\n\\n“If master will permit my saying so,” Conseil replied, “I never\\nexpected to win that prize, and the Union government could have\\npromised $100,000.00 and been none the poorer.”\\n\\n“You’re right, Conseil, it turned out to be a foolish business after\\nall, and we jumped into it too hastily. What a waste of time, what a\\nfutile expense of emotion! Six months ago we could have been back in\\nFrance—”\\n\\n“In master’s little apartment,” Conseil answered. “In master’s museum!\\nAnd by now I would have classified master’s fossils. And master’s\\nbabirusa would be ensconced in its cage at the zoo in the Botanical\\nGardens, and it would have attracted every curiosity seeker in town!”\\n\\n“Quite so, Conseil, and what’s more, I imagine that people will soon\\nbe poking fun at us!”\\n\\n“To be sure,” Conseil replied serenely, “I do think they’ll have fun\\nat master’s expense. And must it be said . . . ?”\\n\\n“It must be said, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Well then, it will serve master right!”\\n\\n“How true!”\\n\\n“When one has the honor of being an expert as master is, one mustn’t\\nlay himself open to—”\\n\\nConseil didn’t have time to complete the compliment. In the midst of\\nthe general silence, a voice became audible. It was Ned Land’s voice,\\nand it shouted:\\n\\n“Ahoy! There’s the thing in question, abreast of us to leeward!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nAt Full Steam\\n\\n\\nAT THIS SHOUT the entire crew rushed toward the harpooner—commander,\\nofficers, mates, sailors, cabin boys, down to engineers leaving their\\nmachinery and stokers neglecting their furnaces. The order was given\\nto stop, and the frigate merely coasted.\\n\\nBy then the darkness was profound, and as good as the Canadian’s eyes\\nwere, I still wondered how he could see—and what he had seen. My heart\\nwas pounding fit to burst.\\n\\nBut Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all spotted the object his hand\\nwas indicating.\\n\\nTwo cable lengths off the Abraham Lincoln’s starboard quarter, the sea\\nseemed to be lit up from underneath. This was no mere phosphorescent\\nphenomenon, that much was unmistakable. Submerged some fathoms below\\nthe surface of the water, the monster gave off that very intense but\\ninexplicable glow that several captains had mentioned in their\\nreports. This magnificent radiance had to come from some force with a\\ngreat illuminating capacity. The edge of its light swept over the sea\\nin an immense, highly elongated oval, condensing at the center into a\\nblazing core whose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward.\\n\\n“It’s only a cluster of phosphorescent particles!” exclaimed one of\\nthe officers.\\n\\n“No, sir,” I answered with conviction. “Not even angel-wing clams or\\nsalps have ever given off such a powerful light. That glow is\\nbasically electric in nature. Besides . . . look, look! It’s shifting!\\nIt’s moving back and forth! It’s darting at us!”\\n\\nA universal shout went up from the frigate.\\n\\n“Quiet!” Commander Farragut said. “Helm hard to leeward! Reverse\\nengines!”\\n\\nSailors rushed to the helm, engineers to their machinery. Under\\nreverse steam immediately, the Abraham Lincoln beat to port, sweeping\\nin a semicircle.\\n\\n“Right your helm! Engines forward!” Commander Farragut called.\\n\\nThese orders were executed, and the frigate swiftly retreated from\\nthis core of light.\\n\\nMy mistake. It wanted to retreat, but the unearthly animal came at us\\nwith a speed double our own.\\n\\nWe gasped. More stunned than afraid, we stood mute and motionless. The\\nanimal caught up with us, played with us. It made a full circle around\\nthe frigate—then doing fourteen knots—and wrapped us in sheets of\\nelectricity that were like luminous dust. Then it retreated two or\\nthree miles, leaving a phosphorescent trail comparable to those swirls\\nof steam that shoot behind the locomotive of an express\\ntrain. Suddenly, all the way from the dark horizon where it had gone\\nto gather momentum, the monster abruptly dashed toward the Abraham\\nLincoln with frightening speed, stopped sharply twenty feet from our\\nside plates, and died out—not by diving under the water, since its\\nglow did not recede gradually—but all at once, as if the source of\\nthis brilliant emanation had suddenly dried up. Then it reappeared on\\nthe other side of the ship, either by circling around us or by gliding\\nunder our hull. At any instant a collision could have occurred that\\nwould have been fatal to us.\\n\\nMeanwhile I was astonished at the frigate’s maneuvers. It was fleeing,\\nnot fighting. Built to pursue, it was being pursued, and I commented\\non this to Commander Farragut. His face, ordinarily so emotionless,\\nwas stamped with indescribable astonishment.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he answered me, “I don’t know what kind of\\nfearsome creature I’m up against, and I don’t want my frigate running\\nfoolish risks in all this darkness. Besides, how should we attack this\\nunknown creature, how should we defend ourselves against it? Let’s\\nwait for daylight, and then we’ll play a different role.”\\n\\n“You’ve no further doubts, commander, as to the nature of this\\nanimal?”\\n\\n“No, sir, it’s apparently a gigantic narwhale, and an electric one to\\nboot.”\\n\\n“Maybe,” I added, “it’s no more approachable than an electric eel or\\nan electric ray!”\\n\\n“Right,” the commander replied. “And if it has their power to\\nelectrocute, it’s surely the most dreadful animal ever conceived by\\nour Creator. That’s why I’ll keep on my guard, sir.”\\n\\nThe whole crew stayed on their feet all night long. No one even\\nthought of sleeping. Unable to compete with the monster’s speed, the\\nAbraham Lincoln slowed down and stayed at half steam. For its part,\\nthe narwhale mimicked the frigate, simply rode with the waves, and\\nseemed determined not to forsake the field of battle.\\n\\nHowever, near midnight it disappeared, or to use a more appropriate\\nexpression, “it went out,” like a huge glowworm. Had it fled from us?\\nWe were duty bound to fear so rather than hope so. But at 12:53 in the\\nmorning, a deafening hiss became audible, resembling the sound made by\\na waterspout expelled with tremendous intensity.\\n\\nBy then Commander Farragut, Ned Land, and I were on the afterdeck,\\npeering eagerly into the profound gloom.\\n\\n“Ned Land,” the commander asked, “you’ve often heard whales\\nbellowing?”\\n\\n“Often, sir, but never a whale like this, whose sighting earned me\\n$2,000.00.”\\n\\n“Correct, the prize is rightfully yours. But tell me, isn’t that the\\nnoise cetaceans make when they spurt water from their blowholes?”\\n\\n“The very noise, sir, but this one’s way louder. So there can be no\\nmistake. There’s definitely a whale lurking in our waters. With your\\npermission, sir,” the harpooner added, “tomorrow at daybreak we’ll\\nhave words with it.”\\n\\n“If it’s in a mood to listen to you, Mr. Land,” I replied in a tone\\nfar from convinced.\\n\\n“Let me get within four harpoon lengths of it,” the Canadian shot\\nback, “and it had better listen!”\\n\\n“But to get near it,” the commander went on, “I’d have to put a\\nwhaleboat at your disposal?”\\n\\n“Certainly, sir.”\\n\\n“That would be gambling with the lives of my men.”\\n\\n“And with my own!” the harpooner replied simply.\\n\\nNear two o’clock in the morning, the core of light reappeared, no less\\nintense, five miles to windward of the Abraham Lincoln. Despite the\\ndistance, despite the noise of wind and sea, we could distinctly hear\\nthe fearsome thrashings of the animal’s tail, and even its panting\\nbreath. Seemingly, the moment this enormous narwhale came up to\\nbreathe at the surface of the ocean, air was sucked into its lungs\\nlike steam into the huge cylinders of a 2,000-horsepower engine.\\n\\n“Hmm!” I said to myself. “A cetacean as powerful as a whole cavalry\\nregiment—now that’s a whale of a whale!”\\n\\nWe stayed on the alert until daylight, getting ready for\\naction. Whaling gear was set up along the railings. Our chief officer\\nloaded the blunderbusses, which can launch harpoons as far as a mile,\\nand long duck guns with exploding bullets that can mortally wound even\\nthe most powerful animals. Ned Land was content to sharpen his\\nharpoon, a dreadful weapon in his hands.\\n\\nAt six o’clock day began to break, and with the dawn’s early light,\\nthe narwhale’s electric glow disappeared. At seven o’clock the day was\\nwell along, but a very dense morning mist shrank the horizon, and our\\nbest spyglasses were unable to pierce it. The outcome: disappointment\\nand anger.\\n\\nI hoisted myself up to the crosstrees of the mizzen sail. Some\\nofficers were already perched on the mastheads.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock the mist rolled ponderously over the waves, and its\\nhuge curls were lifting little by little. The horizon grew wider and\\nclearer all at once.\\n\\nSuddenly, just as on the previous evening, Ned Land’s voice was\\naudible.\\n\\n“There’s the thing in question, astern to port!” the harpooner\\nshouted.\\n\\nEvery eye looked toward the point indicated.\\n\\nThere, a mile and a half from the frigate, a long blackish body\\nemerged a meter above the waves. Quivering violently, its tail was\\ncreating a considerable eddy. Never had caudal equipment thrashed the\\nsea with such power. An immense wake of glowing whiteness marked the\\nanimal’s track, sweeping in a long curve.\\n\\nOur frigate drew nearer to the cetacean. I examined it with a\\ncompletely open mind. Those reports from the Shannon and the Helvetia\\nhad slightly exaggerated its dimensions, and I put its length at only\\n250 feet. Its girth was more difficult to judge, but all in all, the\\nanimal seemed to be wonderfully proportioned in all three dimensions.\\n\\nWhile I was observing this phenomenal creature, two jets of steam and\\nwater sprang from its blowholes and rose to an altitude of forty\\nmeters, which settled for me its mode of breathing. From this I\\nfinally concluded that it belonged to the branch Vertebrata, class\\nMammalia, subclass Monodelphia, group Pisciforma, order Cetacea,\\nfamily . . . but here I couldn’t make up my mind. The order Cetacea\\nconsists of three families, baleen whales, sperm whales, dolphins, and\\nit’s in this last group that narwhales are placed. Each of these\\nfamilies is divided into several genera, each genus into species, each\\nspecies into varieties. So I was still missing variety, species,\\ngenus, and family, but no doubt I would complete my classifying with\\nthe aid of Heaven and Commander Farragut.\\n\\nThe crew were waiting impatiently for orders from their leader. The\\nlatter, after carefully observing the animal, called for his\\nengineer. The engineer raced over.\\n\\n“Sir,” the commander said, “are you up to pressure?”\\n\\n“Aye, sir,” the engineer replied.\\n\\n“Fine. Stoke your furnaces and clap on full steam!”\\n\\nThree cheers greeted this order. The hour of battle had sounded. A few\\nmoments later, the frigate’s two funnels vomited torrents of black\\nsmoke, and its deck quaked from the trembling of its boilers.\\n\\nDriven forward by its powerful propeller, the Abraham Lincoln headed\\nstraight for the animal. Unconcerned, the latter let us come within\\nhalf a cable length; then, not bothering to dive, it got up a little\\nspeed, retreated, and was content to keep its distance.\\n\\nThis chase dragged on for about three-quarters of an hour without the\\nfrigate gaining two fathoms on the cetacean. At this rate, it was\\nobvious that we would never catch up with it.\\n\\nInfuriated, Commander Farragut kept twisting the thick tuft of hair\\nthat flourished below his chin.\\n\\n“Ned Land!” he called.\\n\\nThe Canadian reported at once.\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Land,” the commander asked, “do you still advise putting my\\nlongboats to sea?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” Ned Land replied, “because that beast won’t be caught\\nagainst its will.”\\n\\n“Then what should we do?”\\n\\n“Stoke up more steam, sir, if you can. As for me, with your permission\\nI’ll go perch on the bobstays under the bowsprit, and if we can get\\nwithin a harpoon length, I’ll harpoon the brute.”\\n\\n“Go to it, Ned,” Commander Farragut replied. “Engineer,” he called,\\n“keep the pressure mounting!”\\n\\nNed Land made his way to his post. The furnaces were urged into\\ngreater activity; our propeller did forty-three revolutions per\\nminute, and steam shot from the valves. Heaving the log, we verified\\nthat the Abraham Lincoln was going at the rate of 18.5 miles per hour.\\n\\nBut that damned animal also did a speed of 18.5.\\n\\nFor the next hour our frigate kept up this pace without gaining a\\nfathom! This was humiliating for one of the fastest racers in the\\nAmerican navy. The crew were working up into a blind rage. Sailor\\nafter sailor heaved insults at the monster, which couldn’t be bothered\\nwith answering back. Commander Farragut was no longer content simply\\nto twist his goatee; he chewed on it.\\n\\nThe engineer was summoned once again.\\n\\n“You’re up to maximum pressure?” the commander asked him.\\n\\n“Aye, sir,” the engineer replied.\\n\\n“And your valves are charged to . . . ?”\\n\\n“To six and a half atmospheres.”\\n\\n“Charge them to ten atmospheres.”\\n\\nA typical American order if I ever heard one. It would have sounded\\njust fine during some Mississippi paddle-wheeler race, to “outstrip\\nthe competition!”\\n\\n“Conseil,” I said to my gallant servant, now at my side, “you realize\\nthat we’ll probably blow ourselves skyhigh?”\\n\\n“As master wishes!” Conseil replied.\\n\\nAll right, I admit it: I did wish to run this risk!\\n\\nThe valves were charged. More coal was swallowed by the\\nfurnaces. Ventilators shot torrents of air over the braziers. The\\nAbraham Lincoln’s speed increased. Its masts trembled down to their\\nblocks, and swirls of smoke could barely squeeze through the narrow\\nfunnels.\\n\\nWe heaved the log a second time.\\n\\n“Well, helmsman?” Commander Farragut asked.\\n\\n“19.3 miles per hour, sir.”\\n\\n“Keep stoking the furnaces.”\\n\\nThe engineer did so. The pressure gauge marked ten atmospheres. But no\\ndoubt the cetacean itself had “warmed up,” because without the least\\ntrouble, it also did 19.3.\\n\\nWhat a chase! No, I can’t describe the excitement that shook my very\\nbeing. Ned Land stayed at his post, harpoon in hand. Several times the\\nanimal let us approach.\\n\\n“We’re overhauling it!” the Canadian would shout.\\n\\nThen, just as he was about to strike, the cetacean would steal off\\nwith a swiftness I could estimate at no less than thirty miles per\\nhour. And even at our maximum speed, it took the liberty of thumbing\\nits nose at the frigate by running a full circle around us! A howl of\\nfury burst from every throat!\\n\\nBy noon we were no farther along than at eight o’clock in the morning.\\n\\nCommander Farragut then decided to use more direct methods.\\n\\n“Bah!” he said. “So that animal is faster than the Abraham\\nLincoln. All right, we’ll see if it can outrun our conical shells!\\nMate, man the gun in the bow!”\\n\\nOur forecastle cannon was immediately loaded and leveled. The\\ncannoneer fired a shot, but his shell passed some feet above the\\ncetacean, which stayed half a mile off.\\n\\n“Over to somebody with better aim!” the commander shouted. “And\\n$500.00 to the man who can pierce that infernal beast!”\\n\\nCalm of eye, cool of feature, an old gray-bearded gunner—I can see him\\nto this day—approached the cannon, put it in position, and took aim\\nfor a good while. There was a mighty explosion, mingled with cheers\\nfrom the crew.\\n\\nThe shell reached its target; it hit the animal, but not in the usual\\nfashion—it bounced off that rounded surface and vanished into the sea\\ntwo miles out.\\n\\n“Oh drat!” said the old gunner in his anger. “That rascal must be\\ncovered with six-inch armor plate!”\\n\\n“Curse the beast!” Commander Farragut shouted.\\n\\nThe hunt was on again, and Commander Farragut leaned over to me,\\nsaying:\\n\\n“I’ll chase that animal till my frigate explodes!”\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied, “and nobody would blame you!”\\n\\nWe could still hope that the animal would tire out and not be as\\ninsensitive to exhaustion as our steam engines. But no such luck. Hour\\nafter hour went by without it showing the least sign of weariness.\\n\\nHowever, to the Abraham Lincoln’s credit, it must be said that we\\nstruggled on with tireless persistence. I estimate that we covered a\\ndistance of at least 500 kilometers during this ill-fated day of\\nNovember 6. But night fell and wrapped the surging ocean in its\\nshadows.\\n\\nBy then I thought our expedition had come to an end, that we would\\nnever see this fantastic animal again. I was mistaken.\\n\\nAt 10:50 in the evening, that electric light reappeared three miles to\\nwindward of the frigate, just as clear and intense as the night\\nbefore.\\n\\nThe narwhale seemed motionless. Was it asleep perhaps, weary from its\\nworkday, just riding with the waves? This was our chance, and\\nCommander Farragut was determined to take full advantage of it.\\n\\nHe gave his orders. The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam,\\nadvancing cautiously so as not to awaken its adversary. In midocean\\nit’s not unusual to encounter whales so sound asleep they can\\nsuccessfully be attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned more than one in\\nits slumber. The Canadian went to resume his post on the bobstays\\nunder the bowsprit.\\n\\nThe frigate approached without making a sound, stopped two cable\\nlengths from the animal and coasted. Not a soul breathed on board. A\\nprofound silence reigned over the deck. We were not 100 feet from the\\nblazing core of light, whose glow grew stronger and dazzled the eyes.\\n\\nJust then, leaning over the forecastle railing, I saw Ned Land below\\nme, one hand grasping the martingale, the other brandishing his\\ndreadful harpoon. Barely twenty feet separated him from the motionless\\nanimal.\\n\\nAll at once his arm shot forward and the harpoon was launched. I heard\\nthe weapon collide resonantly, as if it had hit some hard substance.\\n\\nThe electric light suddenly went out, and two enormous waterspouts\\ncrashed onto the deck of the frigate, racing like a torrent from stem\\nto stern, toppling crewmen, breaking spare masts and yardarms from\\ntheir lashings.\\n\\nA hideous collision occurred, and thrown over the rail with no time to\\ncatch hold of it, I was hurled into the sea.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nA Whale of Unknown Species\\n\\n\\nALTHOUGH I WAS startled by this unexpected descent, I at least have a\\nvery clear recollection of my sensations during it.\\n\\nAt first I was dragged about twenty feet under. I’m a good swimmer,\\nwithout claiming to equal such other authors as Byron and Edgar Allan\\nPoe, who were master divers, and I didn’t lose my head on the way\\ndown. With two vigorous kicks of the heel, I came back to the surface\\nof the sea.\\n\\nMy first concern was to look for the frigate. Had the crew seen me go\\noverboard? Was the Abraham Lincoln tacking about? Would Commander\\nFarragut put a longboat to sea? Could I hope to be rescued?\\n\\nThe gloom was profound. I glimpsed a black mass disappearing eastward,\\nwhere its running lights were fading out in the distance. It was the\\nfrigate. I felt I was done for.\\n\\n“Help! Help!” I shouted, swimming desperately toward the Abraham\\nLincoln.\\n\\nMy clothes were weighing me down. The water glued them to my body,\\nthey were paralyzing my movements. I was sinking! I was suffocating\\n. . . !\\n\\n“Help!”\\n\\nThis was the last shout I gave. My mouth was filling with water. I\\nstruggled against being dragged into the depths. . . .\\n\\nSuddenly my clothes were seized by energetic hands, I felt myself\\npulled abruptly back to the surface of the sea, and yes, I heard these\\nwords pronounced in my ear:\\n\\n“If master would oblige me by leaning on my shoulder, master will swim\\nwith much greater ease.”\\n\\nWith one hand I seized the arm of my loyal Conseil.\\n\\n“You!” I said. “You!”\\n\\n“Myself,” Conseil replied, “and at master’s command.”\\n\\n“That collision threw you overboard along with me?”\\n\\n“Not at all. But being in master’s employ, I followed master.”\\n\\nThe fine lad thought this only natural!\\n\\n“What about the frigate?” I asked.\\n\\n“The frigate?” Conseil replied, rolling over on his back. “I think\\nmaster had best not depend on it to any great extent!”\\n\\n“What are you saying?”\\n\\n“I’m saying that just as I jumped overboard, I heard the men at the\\nhelm shout, ‘Our propeller and rudder are smashed!’ ”\\n\\n“Smashed?”\\n\\n“Yes, smashed by the monster’s tusk! I believe it’s the sole injury\\nthe Abraham Lincoln has sustained. But most inconveniently for us, the\\nship can no longer steer.”\\n\\n“Then we’re done for!”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” Conseil replied serenely. “However, we still have a few\\nhours before us, and in a few hours one can do a great many things!”\\n\\nConseil’s unflappable composure cheered me up. I swam more vigorously,\\nbut hampered by clothes that were as restricting as a cloak made of\\nlead, I was managing with only the greatest difficulty. Conseil\\nnoticed as much.\\n\\n“Master will allow me to make an incision,” he said.\\n\\nAnd he slipped an open clasp knife under my clothes, slitting them\\nfrom top to bottom with one swift stroke. Then he briskly undressed me\\nwhile I swam for us both.\\n\\nI then did Conseil the same favor, and we continued to “navigate” side\\nby side.\\n\\nBut our circumstances were no less dreadful. Perhaps they hadn’t seen\\nus go overboard; and even if they had, the frigate—being undone by its\\nrudder—couldn’t return to leeward after us. So we could count only on\\nits longboats.\\n\\nConseil had coolly reasoned out this hypothesis and laid his plans\\naccordingly. An amazing character, this boy; in midocean, this stoic\\nlad seemed right at home!\\n\\nSo, having concluded that our sole chance for salvation lay in being\\npicked up by the Abraham Lincoln’s longboats, we had to take steps to\\nwait for them as long as possible. Consequently, I decided to divide\\nour energies so we wouldn’t both be worn out at the same time, and\\nthis was the arrangement: while one of us lay on his back, staying\\nmotionless with arms crossed and legs outstretched, the other would\\nswim and propel his partner forward. This towing role was to last no\\nlonger than ten minutes, and by relieving each other in this way, we\\ncould stay afloat for hours, perhaps even until daybreak.\\n\\nSlim chance, but hope springs eternal in the human breast! Besides,\\nthere were two of us. Lastly, I can vouch—as improbable as it\\nseems—that even if I had wanted to destroy all my illusions, even if I\\nhad been willing to “give in to despair,” I could not have done so!\\n\\nThe cetacean had rammed our frigate at about eleven o’clock in the\\nevening. I therefore calculated on eight hours of swimming until\\nsunrise. A strenuous task, but feasible, thanks to our relieving each\\nother. The sea was pretty smooth and barely tired us. Sometimes I\\ntried to peer through the dense gloom, which was broken only by the\\nphosphorescent flickers coming from our movements. I stared at the\\nluminous ripples breaking over my hands, shimmering sheets spattered\\nwith blotches of bluish gray. It seemed as if we’d plunged into a pool\\nof quicksilver.\\n\\nNear one o’clock in the morning, I was overcome with tremendous\\nexhaustion. My limbs stiffened in the grip of intense cramps. Conseil\\nhad to keep me going, and attending to our self-preservation became\\nhis sole responsibility. I soon heard the poor lad gasping; his\\nbreathing became shallow and quick. I didn’t think he could stand such\\nexertions for much longer.\\n\\n“Go on! Go on!” I told him.\\n\\n“Leave master behind?” he replied. “Never! I’ll drown before he does!”\\n\\nJust then, past the fringes of a large cloud that the wind was driving\\neastward, the moon appeared. The surface of the sea glistened under\\nits rays. That kindly light rekindled our strength. I held up my head\\nagain. My eyes darted to every point of the horizon. I spotted the\\nfrigate. It was five miles from us and formed no more than a dark,\\nbarely perceptible mass. But as for longboats, not a one in sight!\\n\\nI tried to call out. What was the use at such a distance! My swollen\\nlips wouldn’t let a single sound through. Conseil could still\\narticulate a few words, and I heard him repeat at intervals:\\n\\n“Help! Help!”\\n\\nCeasing all movement for an instant, we listened. And it may have been\\na ringing in my ear, from this organ filling with impeded blood, but\\nit seemed to me that Conseil’s shout had received an answer back.\\n\\n“Did you hear that?” I muttered.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!”\\n\\nAnd Conseil hurled another desperate plea into space.\\n\\nThis time there could be no mistake! A human voice had answered us!\\nWas it the voice of some poor devil left behind in midocean, some\\nother victim of that collision suffered by our ship? Or was it one of\\nthe frigate’s longboats, hailing us out of the gloom?\\n\\nConseil made one final effort, and bracing his hands on my shoulders,\\nwhile I offered resistance with one supreme exertion, he raised\\nhimself half out of the water, then fell back exhausted.\\n\\n“What did you see?”\\n\\n“I saw . . . ,” he muttered, “I saw . . . but we mustn’t talk\\n. . . save our strength . . . !”\\n\\nWhat had he seen? Then, lord knows why, the thought of the monster\\ncame into my head for the first time . . . ! But even so, that voice\\n. . . ? Gone are the days when Jonahs took refuge in the bellies of\\nwhales!\\n\\nNevertheless, Conseil kept towing me. Sometimes he looked up, stared\\nstraight ahead, and shouted a request for directions, which was\\nanswered by a voice that was getting closer and closer. I could barely\\nhear it. I was at the end of my strength; my fingers gave out; my\\nhands were no help to me; my mouth opened convulsively, filling with\\nbrine; its coldness ran through me; I raised my head one last time,\\nthen I collapsed. . . .\\n\\nJust then something hard banged against me. I clung to it. Then I felt\\nmyself being pulled upward, back to the surface of the water; my chest\\ncaved in, and I fainted. . . .\\n\\nFor certain, I came to quickly, because someone was massaging me so\\nvigorously it left furrows in my flesh. I half opened my eyes. . . .\\n\\n“Conseil!” I muttered.\\n\\n“Did master ring for me?” Conseil replied.\\n\\nJust then, in the last light of a moon settling on the horizon, I\\nspotted a face that wasn’t Conseil’s but which I recognized at once.\\n\\n“Ned!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“In person, sir, and still after his prize!” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“You were thrown overboard after the frigate’s collision?”\\n\\n“Yes, professor, but I was luckier than you, and right away I was able\\nto set foot on this floating islet.”\\n\\n“Islet?”\\n\\n“Or in other words, on our gigantic narwhale.”\\n\\n“Explain yourself, Ned.”\\n\\n“It’s just that I soon realized why my harpoon got blunted and\\ncouldn’t puncture its hide.”\\n\\n“Why, Ned, why?”\\n\\n“Because, professor, this beast is made of boilerplate steel!”\\n\\nAt this point in my story, I need to get a grip on myself, reconstruct\\nexactly what I experienced, and make doubly sure of everything I\\nwrite.\\n\\nThe Canadian’s last words caused a sudden upheaval in my brain. I\\nswiftly hoisted myself to the summit of this half-submerged creature\\nor object that was serving as our refuge. I tested it with my\\nfoot. Obviously it was some hard, impenetrable substance, not the soft\\nmatter that makes up the bodies of our big marine mammals.\\n\\nBut this hard substance could have been a bony carapace, like those\\nthat covered some prehistoric animals, and I might have left it at\\nthat and classified this monster among such amphibious reptiles as\\nturtles or alligators.\\n\\nWell, no. The blackish back supporting me was smooth and polished with\\nno overlapping scales. On impact, it gave off a metallic sonority, and\\nas incredible as this sounds, it seemed, I swear, to be made of\\nriveted plates.\\n\\nNo doubts were possible! This animal, this monster, this natural\\nphenomenon that had puzzled the whole scientific world, that had\\nmuddled and misled the minds of seamen in both hemispheres, was, there\\ncould be no escaping it, an even more astonishing phenomenon—a\\nphenomenon made by the hand of man.\\n\\nEven if I had discovered that some fabulous, mythological creature\\nreally existed, it wouldn’t have given me such a terrific mental\\njolt. It’s easy enough to accept that prodigious things can come from\\nour Creator. But to find, all at once, right before your eyes, that\\nthe impossible had been mysteriously achieved by man himself: this\\nstaggers the mind!\\n\\nBut there was no question now. We were stretched out on the back of\\nsome kind of underwater boat that, as far as I could judge, boasted\\nthe shape of an immense steel fish. Ned Land had clear views on the\\nissue. Conseil and I could only line up behind him.\\n\\n“But then,” I said, “does this contraption contain some sort of\\nlocomotive mechanism, and a crew to run it?”\\n\\n“Apparently,” the harpooner replied. “And yet for the three hours I’ve\\nlived on this floating island, it hasn’t shown a sign of life.”\\n\\n“This boat hasn’t moved at all?”\\n\\n“No, Professor Aronnax. It just rides with the waves, but otherwise it\\nhasn’t stirred.”\\n\\n“But we know that it’s certainly gifted with great speed. Now then,\\nsince an engine is needed to generate that speed, and a mechanic to\\nrun that engine, I conclude: we’re saved.”\\n\\n“Humph!” Ned Land put in, his tone denoting reservations.\\n\\nJust then, as if to take my side in the argument, a bubbling began\\nastern of this strange submersible—whose drive mechanism was obviously\\na propeller—and the boat started to move. We barely had time to hang\\non to its topside, which emerged about eighty centimeters above\\nwater. Fortunately its speed was not excessive.\\n\\n“So long as it navigates horizontally,” Ned Land muttered, “I’ve no\\ncomplaints. But if it gets the urge to dive, I wouldn’t give $2.00 for\\nmy hide!”\\n\\nThe Canadian might have quoted a much lower price. So it was\\nimperative to make contact with whatever beings were confined inside\\nthe plating of this machine. I searched its surface for an opening or\\na hatch, a “manhole,” to use the official term; but the lines of\\nrivets had been firmly driven into the sheet-iron joins and were\\nstraight and uniform.\\n\\nMoreover, the moon then disappeared and left us in profound\\ndarkness. We had to wait for daylight to find some way of getting\\ninside this underwater boat.\\n\\nSo our salvation lay totally in the hands of the mysterious helmsmen\\nsteering this submersible, and if it made a dive, we were done for!\\nBut aside from this occurring, I didn’t doubt the possibility of our\\nmaking contact with them. In fact, if they didn’t produce their own\\nair, they inevitably had to make periodic visits to the surface of the\\nocean to replenish their oxygen supply. Hence the need for some\\nopening that put the boat’s interior in contact with the atmosphere.\\n\\nAs for any hope of being rescued by Commander Farragut, that had to be\\nrenounced completely. We were being swept westward, and I estimate\\nthat our comparatively moderate speed reached twelve miles per\\nhour. The propeller churned the waves with mathematical regularity,\\nsometimes emerging above the surface and throwing phosphorescent spray\\nto great heights.\\n\\nNear four o’clock in the morning, the submersible picked up speed. We\\ncould barely cope with this dizzying rush, and the waves battered us\\nat close range. Fortunately Ned’s hands came across a big mooring ring\\nfastened to the topside of this sheet-iron back, and we all held on\\nfor dear life.\\n\\nFinally this long night was over. My imperfect memories won’t let me\\nrecall my every impression of it. A single detail comes back to\\nme. Several times, during various lulls of wind and sea, I thought I\\nheard indistinct sounds, a sort of elusive harmony produced by distant\\nmusical chords. What was the secret behind this underwater navigating,\\nwhose explanation the whole world had sought in vain? What beings\\nlived inside this strange boat? What mechanical force allowed it to\\nmove about with such prodigious speed?\\n\\nDaylight appeared. The morning mists surrounded us, but they soon\\nbroke up. I was about to proceed with a careful examination of the\\nhull, whose topside formed a sort of horizontal platform, when I felt\\nit sinking little by little.\\n\\n“Oh, damnation!” Ned Land shouted, stamping his foot on the resonant\\nsheet iron. “Open up there, you antisocial navigators!”\\n\\nBut it was difficult to make yourself heard above the deafening beats\\nof the propeller. Fortunately this submerging movement stopped.\\n\\nFrom inside the boat, there suddenly came noises of iron fastenings\\npushed roughly aside. One of the steel plates flew up, a man appeared,\\ngave a bizarre yell, and instantly disappeared.\\n\\nA few moments later, eight strapping fellows appeared silently, their\\nfaces like masks, and dragged us down into their fearsome machine.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\n“Mobilis in Mobili”\\n\\n\\nTHIS BRUTALLY EXECUTED capture was carried out with lightning\\nspeed. My companions and I had no time to collect ourselves. I don’t\\nknow how they felt about being shoved inside this aquatic prison, but\\nas for me, I was shivering all over. With whom were we dealing? Surely\\nwith some new breed of pirates, exploiting the sea after their own\\nfashion.\\n\\nThe narrow hatch had barely closed over me when I was surrounded by\\nprofound darkness. Saturated with the outside light, my eyes couldn’t\\nmake out a thing. I felt my naked feet clinging to the steps of an\\niron ladder. Forcibly seized, Ned Land and Conseil were behind me. At\\nthe foot of the ladder, a door opened and instantly closed behind us\\nwith a loud clang.\\n\\nWe were alone. Where? I couldn’t say, could barely even imagine. All\\nwas darkness, but such utter darkness that after several minutes, my\\neyes were still unable to catch a single one of those hazy gleams that\\ndrift through even the blackest nights.\\n\\nMeanwhile, furious at these goings on, Ned Land gave free rein to his\\nindignation.\\n\\n“Damnation!” he exclaimed. “These people are about as hospitable as\\nthe savages of New Caledonia! All that’s lacking is for them to be\\ncannibals! I wouldn’t be surprised if they were, but believe you me,\\nthey won’t eat me without my kicking up a protest!”\\n\\n“Calm yourself, Ned my friend,” Conseil replied serenely. “Don’t flare\\nup so quickly! We aren’t in a kettle yet!”\\n\\n“In a kettle, no,” the Canadian shot back, “but in an oven for\\nsure. It’s dark enough for one. Luckily my Bowie knife hasn’t left me,\\nand I can still see well enough to put it to use.* The first one of\\nthese bandits who lays a hand on me—”\\n\\n*Author’s Note: A Bowie knife is a wide-bladed dagger that Americans\\n are forever carrying around.\\n\\n“Don’t be so irritable, Ned,” I then told the harpooner, “and don’t\\nruin things for us with pointless violence. Who knows whether they\\nmight be listening to us? Instead, let’s try to find out where we\\nare!”\\n\\nI started moving, groping my way. After five steps I encountered an\\niron wall made of riveted boilerplate. Then, turning around, I bumped\\ninto a wooden table next to which several stools had been set. The\\nfloor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick, hempen matting that\\ndeadened the sound of footsteps. Its naked walls didn’t reveal any\\ntrace of a door or window. Going around the opposite way, Conseil met\\nup with me, and we returned to the middle of this cabin, which had to\\nbe twenty feet long by ten wide. As for its height, not even Ned Land,\\nwith his great stature, was able to determine it.\\n\\nHalf an hour had already gone by without our situation changing, when\\nour eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into blinding\\nlight. Our prison lit up all at once; in other words, it filled with\\nluminescent matter so intense that at first I couldn’t stand the\\nbrightness of it. From its glare and whiteness, I recognized the\\nelectric glow that had played around this underwater boat like some\\nmagnificent phosphorescent phenomenon. After involuntarily closing my\\neyes, I reopened them and saw that this luminous force came from a\\nfrosted half globe curving out of the cabin’s ceiling.\\n\\n“Finally! It’s light enough to see!” Ned Land exclaimed, knife in\\nhand, staying on the defensive.\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied, then ventured the opposite view. “But as for our\\nsituation, we’re still in the dark.”\\n\\n“Master must learn patience,” said the emotionless Conseil.\\n\\nThis sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its\\ntiniest details. It contained only a table and five stools. Its\\ninvisible door must have been hermetically sealed. Not a sound reached\\nour ears. Everything seemed dead inside this boat. Was it in motion,\\nor stationary on the surface of the ocean, or sinking into the depths?\\nI couldn’t tell.\\n\\nBut this luminous globe hadn’t been turned on without good\\nreason. Consequently, I hoped that some crewmen would soon make an\\nappearance. If you want to consign people to oblivion, you don’t light\\nup their dungeons.\\n\\nI was not mistaken. Unlocking noises became audible, a door opened,\\nand two men appeared.\\n\\nOne was short and stocky, powerfully muscled, broad shouldered, robust\\nof limbs, the head squat, the hair black and luxuriant, the mustache\\nheavy, the eyes bright and penetrating, and his whole personality\\nstamped with that southern-blooded zest that, in France, typifies the\\npeople of Provence. The philosopher Diderot has very aptly claimed\\nthat a man’s bearing is the clue to his character, and this stocky\\nlittle man was certainly a living proof of this claim. You could sense\\nthat his everyday conversation must have been packed with such vivid\\nfigures of speech as personification, symbolism, and misplaced\\nmodifiers. But I was never in a position to verify this because,\\naround me, he used only an odd and utterly incomprehensible dialect.\\n\\nThe second stranger deserves a more detailed description. A disciple\\nof such character-judging anatomists as Gratiolet or Engel could have\\nread this man’s features like an open book. Without hesitation, I\\nidentified his dominant qualities—self-confidence, since his head\\nreared like a nobleman’s above the arc formed by the lines of his\\nshoulders, and his black eyes gazed with icy assurance; calmness,\\nsince his skin, pale rather than ruddy, indicated tranquility of\\nblood; energy, shown by the swiftly knitting muscles of his brow; and\\nfinally courage, since his deep breathing denoted tremendous reserves\\nof vitality.\\n\\nI might add that this was a man of great pride, that his calm, firm\\ngaze seemed to reflect thinking on an elevated plane, and that the\\nharmony of his facial expressions and bodily movements resulted in an\\noverall effect of unquestionable candor—according to the findings of\\nphysiognomists, those analysts of facial character.\\n\\nI felt “involuntarily reassured” in his presence, and this boded well\\nfor our interview.\\n\\nWhether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I could\\nnot precisely state. He was tall, his forehead broad, his nose\\nstraight, his mouth clearly etched, his teeth magnificent, his hands\\nrefined, tapered, and to use a word from palmistry, highly “psychic,”\\nin other words, worthy of serving a lofty and passionate spirit. This\\nman was certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I had ever\\nencountered. One unusual detail: his eyes were spaced a little far\\nfrom each other and could instantly take in nearly a quarter of the\\nhorizon. This ability—as I later verified—was strengthened by a range\\nof vision even greater than Ned Land’s. When this stranger focused his\\ngaze on an object, his eyebrow lines gathered into a frown, his heavy\\neyelids closed around his pupils to contract his huge field of vision,\\nand he looked! What a look—as if he could magnify objects shrinking\\ninto the distance; as if he could probe your very soul; as if he could\\npierce those sheets of water so opaque to our eyes and scan the\\ndeepest seas . . . !\\n\\nWearing caps made of sea-otter fur, and shod in sealskin fishing\\nboots, these two strangers were dressed in clothing made from some\\nunique fabric that flattered the figure and allowed great freedom of\\nmovement.\\n\\nThe taller of the two—apparently the leader on board—examined us with\\nthe greatest care but without pronouncing a word. Then, turning to his\\ncompanion, he conversed with him in a language I didn’t recognize. It\\nwas a sonorous, harmonious, flexible dialect whose vowels seemed to\\nundergo a highly varied accentuation.\\n\\nThe other replied with a shake of the head and added two or three\\nutterly incomprehensible words. Then he seemed to question me directly\\nwith a long stare.\\n\\nI replied in clear French that I wasn’t familiar with his language;\\nbut he didn’t seem to understand me, and the situation grew rather\\nbaffling.\\n\\n“Still, master should tell our story,” Conseil said to me. “Perhaps\\nthese gentlemen will grasp a few words of it!”\\n\\nI tried again, telling the tale of our adventures, clearly\\narticulating my every syllable, and not leaving out a single detail. I\\nstated our names and titles; then, in order, I introduced Professor\\nAronnax, his manservant Conseil, and Mr. Ned Land, harpooner.\\n\\nThe man with calm, gentle eyes listened to me serenely, even\\ncourteously, and paid remarkable attention. But nothing in his facial\\nexpression indicated that he understood my story. When I finished, he\\ndidn’t pronounce a single word.\\n\\nOne resource still left was to speak English. Perhaps they would be\\nfamiliar with this nearly universal language. But I only knew it, as I\\ndid the German language, well enough to read it fluently, not well\\nenough to speak it correctly. Here, however, our overriding need was\\nto make ourselves understood.\\n\\n“Come on, it’s your turn,” I told the harpooner. “Over to you,\\nMr. Land. Pull out of your bag of tricks the best English ever spoken\\nby an Anglo-Saxon, and try for a more favorable result than mine.”\\n\\nNed needed no persuading and started our story all over again, most of\\nwhich I could follow. Its content was the same, but the form\\ndiffered. Carried away by his volatile temperament, the Canadian put\\ngreat animation into it. He complained vehemently about being\\nimprisoned in defiance of his civil rights, asked by virtue of which\\nlaw he was hereby detained, invoked writs of habeas corpus, threatened\\nto press charges against anyone holding him in illegal custody,\\nranted, gesticulated, shouted, and finally conveyed by an expressive\\ngesture that we were dying of hunger.\\n\\nThis was perfectly true, but we had nearly forgotten the fact.\\n\\nMuch to his amazement, the harpooner seemed no more intelligible than\\nI had been. Our visitors didn’t bat an eye. Apparently they were\\nengineers who understood the languages of neither the French physicist\\nArago nor the English physicist Faraday.\\n\\nThoroughly baffled after vainly exhausting our philological resources,\\nI no longer knew what tactic to pursue, when Conseil told me:\\n\\n“If master will authorize me, I’ll tell the whole business in German.”\\n\\n“What! You know German?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Like most Flemish people, with all due respect to master.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, my respect is due you. Go to it, my boy.”\\n\\nAnd Conseil, in his serene voice, described for the third time the\\nvarious vicissitudes of our story. But despite our narrator’s fine\\naccent and stylish turns of phrase, the German language met with no\\nsuccess.\\n\\nFinally, as a last resort, I hauled out everything I could remember\\nfrom my early schooldays, and I tried to narrate our adventures in\\nLatin. Cicero would have plugged his ears and sent me to the scullery,\\nbut somehow I managed to pull through. With the same negative result.\\n\\nThis last attempt ultimately misfiring, the two strangers exchanged a\\nfew words in their incomprehensible language and withdrew, not even\\nfavoring us with one of those encouraging gestures that are used in\\nevery country in the world. The door closed again.\\n\\n“This is outrageous!” Ned Land shouted, exploding for the twentieth\\ntime. “I ask you! We speak French, English, German, and Latin to these\\nrogues, and neither of them has the decency to even answer back!”\\n\\n“Calm down, Ned,” I told the seething harpooner. “Anger won’t get us\\nanywhere.”\\n\\n“But professor,” our irascible companion went on, “can’t you see that\\nwe could die of hunger in this iron cage?”\\n\\n“Bah!” Conseil put in philosophically. “We can hold out a good while\\nyet!”\\n\\n“My friends,” I said, “we mustn’t despair. We’ve gotten out of tighter\\nspots. So please do me the favor of waiting a bit before you form your\\nviews on the commander and crew of this boat.”\\n\\n“My views are fully formed,” Ned Land shot back. “They’re rogues!”\\n\\n“Oh good! And from what country?”\\n\\n“Roguedom!”\\n\\n“My gallant Ned, as yet that country isn’t clearly marked on maps of\\nthe world, but I admit that the nationality of these two strangers is\\nhard to make out! Neither English, French, nor German, that’s all we\\ncan say. But I’m tempted to think that the commander and his chief\\nofficer were born in the low latitudes. There must be southern blood\\nin them. But as to whether they’re Spaniards, Turks, Arabs, or East\\nIndians, their physical characteristics don’t give me enough to go\\non. And as for their speech, it’s utterly incomprehensible.”\\n\\n“That’s the nuisance in not knowing every language,” Conseil replied,\\n“or the drawback in not having one universal language!”\\n\\n“Which would all go out the window!” Ned Land replied. “Don’t you see,\\nthese people have a language all to themselves, a language they’ve\\ninvented just to cause despair in decent people who ask for a little\\ndinner! Why, in every country on earth, when you open your mouth, snap\\nyour jaws, smack your lips and teeth, isn’t that the world’s most\\nunderstandable message? From Quebec to the Tuamotu Islands, from Paris\\nto the Antipodes, doesn’t it mean: I’m hungry, give me a bite to eat!”\\n\\n“Oh,” Conseil put in, “there are some people so unintelligent by\\nnature . . .”\\n\\nAs he was saying these words, the door opened. A steward entered.* He\\nbrought us some clothes, jackets and sailor’s pants, made out of a\\nfabric whose nature I didn’t recognize. I hurried to change into them,\\nand my companions followed suit.\\n\\n*Author’s Note: A steward is a waiter on board a steamer.\\n\\nMeanwhile our silent steward, perhaps a deaf-mute, set the table and\\nlaid three place settings.\\n\\n“There’s something serious afoot,” Conseil said, “and it bodes well.”\\n\\n“Bah!” replied the rancorous harpooner. “What the devil do you suppose\\nthey eat around here? Turtle livers, loin of shark, dogfish steaks?”\\n\\n“We’ll soon find out!” Conseil said.\\n\\nOverlaid with silver dish covers, various platters had been neatly\\npositioned on the table cloth, and we sat down to eat. Assuredly, we\\nwere dealing with civilized people, and if it hadn’t been for this\\nelectric light flooding over us, I would have thought we were in the\\ndining room of the Hotel Adelphi in Liverpool, or the Grand Hotel in\\nParis. However, I feel compelled to mention that bread and wine were\\ntotally absent. The water was fresh and clear, but it was still\\nwater—which wasn’t what Ned Land had in mind. Among the foods we were\\nserved, I was able to identify various daintily dressed fish; but I\\ncouldn’t make up my mind about certain otherwise excellent dishes, and\\nI couldn’t even tell whether their contents belonged to the vegetable\\nor the animal kingdom. As for the tableware, it was elegant and in\\nperfect taste. Each utensil, spoon, fork, knife, and plate, bore on\\nits reverse a letter encircled by a Latin motto, and here is its exact\\nduplicate:\\n\\n  MOBILIS IN MOBILI\\n  N\\n\\nMoving within the moving element! It was a highly appropriate motto\\nfor this underwater machine, so long as the preposition in is\\ntranslated as within and not upon. The letter N was no doubt the\\ninitial of the name of that mystifying individual in command beneath\\nthe seas!\\n\\nNed and Conseil had no time for such musings. They were wolfing down\\ntheir food, and without further ado I did the same. By now I felt\\nreassured about our fate, and it seemed obvious that our hosts didn’t\\nintend to let us die of starvation.\\n\\nBut all earthly things come to an end, all things must pass, even the\\nhunger of people who haven’t eaten for fifteen hours. Our appetites\\nappeased, we felt an urgent need for sleep. A natural reaction after\\nthat interminable night of fighting for our lives.\\n\\n“Ye gods, I’ll sleep soundly,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Me, I’m out like a light!” Ned Land replied.\\n\\nMy two companions lay down on the cabin’s carpeting and were soon deep\\nin slumber.\\n\\nAs for me, I gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep. Too\\nmany thoughts had piled up in my mind, too many insoluble questions\\nhad arisen, too many images were keeping my eyelids open! Where were\\nwe? What strange power was carrying us along? I felt—or at least I\\nthought I did—the submersible sinking toward the sea’s lower\\nstrata. Intense nightmares besieged me. In these mysterious marine\\nsanctuaries, I envisioned hosts of unknown animals, and this\\nunderwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs: living,\\nbreathing, just as fearsome . . . ! Then my mind grew calmer, my\\nimagination melted into hazy drowsiness, and I soon fell into an\\nuneasy slumber.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\nThe Tantrums of Ned Land\\n\\n\\nI HAVE NO IDEA how long this slumber lasted; but it must have been a\\ngood while, since we were completely over our exhaustion. I was the\\nfirst one to wake up. My companions weren’t yet stirring and still lay\\nin their corners like inanimate objects.\\n\\nI had barely gotten up from my passably hard mattress when I felt my\\nmind clear, my brain go on the alert. So I began a careful\\nreexamination of our cell.\\n\\nNothing had changed in its interior arrangements. The prison was still\\na prison and its prisoners still prisoners. But, taking advantage of\\nour slumber, the steward had cleared the table. Consequently, nothing\\nindicated any forthcoming improvement in our situation, and I\\nseriously wondered if we were doomed to spend the rest of our lives in\\nthis cage.\\n\\nThis prospect seemed increasingly painful to me because, even though\\nmy brain was clear of its obsessions from the night before, I was\\nfeeling an odd short-windedness in my chest. It was becoming hard for\\nme to breathe. The heavy air was no longer sufficient for the full\\nplay of my lungs. Although our cell was large, we obviously had used\\nup most of the oxygen it contained. In essence, over an hour’s time a\\nsingle human being consumes all the oxygen found in 100 liters of air,\\nat which point that air has become charged with a nearly equal amount\\nof carbon dioxide and is no longer fit for breathing.\\n\\nSo it was now urgent to renew the air in our prison, and no doubt the\\nair in this whole underwater boat as well.\\n\\nHere a question popped into my head. How did the commander of this\\naquatic residence go about it? Did he obtain air using chemical\\nmethods, releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by\\nheating it, meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium\\nhydroxide? If so, he would have to keep up some kind of relationship\\nwith the shore, to come by the materials needed for such an\\noperation. Did he simply limit himself to storing the air in\\nhigh-pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew’s\\nneeds? Perhaps. Or, proceeding in a more convenient, more economical,\\nand consequently more probable fashion, was he satisfied with merely\\nreturning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean,\\nrenewing his oxygen supply every twenty-four hours? In any event,\\nwhatever his method was, it seemed prudent to me that he use this\\nmethod without delay.\\n\\nIn fact, I had already resorted to speeding up my inhalations in order\\nto extract from the cell what little oxygen it contained, when\\nsuddenly I was refreshed by a current of clean air, scented with a\\nsalty aroma. It had to be a sea breeze, life-giving and charged with\\niodine! I opened my mouth wide, and my lungs glutted themselves on the\\nfresh particles. At the same time, I felt a swaying, a rolling of\\nmoderate magnitude but definitely noticeable. This boat, this\\nsheet-iron monster, had obviously just risen to the surface of the\\nocean, there to breathe in good whale fashion. So the ship’s mode of\\nventilation was finally established.\\n\\nWhen I had absorbed a chestful of this clean air, I looked for the\\nconduit—the “air carrier,” if you prefer—that allowed this beneficial\\ninflux to reach us, and I soon found it. Above the door opened an air\\nvent that let in a fresh current of oxygen, renewing the thin air in\\nour cell.\\n\\nI had gotten to this point in my observations when Ned and Conseil\\nwoke up almost simultaneously, under the influence of this reviving\\nair purification. They rubbed their eyes, stretched their arms, and\\nsprang to their feet.\\n\\n“Did master sleep well?” Conseil asked me with his perennial good\\nmanners.\\n\\n“Extremely well, my gallant lad,” I replied. “And how about you,\\nMr. Ned Land?”\\n\\n“Like a log, professor. But I must be imagining things, because it\\nseems like I’m breathing a sea breeze!”\\n\\nA seaman couldn’t be wrong on this topic, and I told the Canadian what\\nhad gone on while he slept.\\n\\n“Good!” he said. “That explains perfectly all that bellowing we heard,\\nwhen our so-called narwhale lay in sight of the Abraham Lincoln.”\\n\\n“Perfectly, Mr. Land. It was catching its breath!”\\n\\n“Only I’ve no idea what time it is, Professor Aronnax, unless maybe\\nit’s dinnertime?”\\n\\n“Dinnertime, my fine harpooner? I’d say at least breakfast time,\\nbecause we’ve certainly woken up to a new day.”\\n\\n“Which indicates,” Conseil replied, “that we’ve spent twenty-four\\nhours in slumber.”\\n\\n“That’s my assessment,” I replied.\\n\\n“I won’t argue with you,” Ned Land answered. “But dinner or breakfast,\\nthat steward will be plenty welcome whether he brings the one or the\\nother.”\\n\\n“The one and the other,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Well put,” the Canadian replied. “We deserve two meals, and speaking\\nfor myself, I’ll do justice to them both.”\\n\\n“All right, Ned, let’s wait and see!” I replied. “It’s clear that\\nthese strangers don’t intend to let us die of hunger, otherwise last\\nevening’s dinner wouldn’t make any sense.”\\n\\n“Unless they’re fattening us up!” Ned shot back.\\n\\n“I object,” I replied. “We have not fallen into the hands of\\ncannibals.”\\n\\n“Just because they don’t make a habit of it,” the Canadian replied in\\nall seriousness, “doesn’t mean they don’t indulge from time to\\ntime. Who knows? Maybe these people have gone without fresh meat for a\\nlong while, and in that case three healthy, well-built specimens like\\nthe professor, his manservant, and me —-”\\n\\n“Get rid of those ideas, Mr. Land,” I answered the harpooner. “And\\nabove all, don’t let them lead you to flare up against our hosts,\\nwhich would only make our situation worse.”\\n\\n“Anyhow,” the harpooner said, “I’m as hungry as all Hades, and dinner\\nor breakfast, not one puny meal has arrived!”\\n\\n“Mr. Land,” I answered, “we have to adapt to the schedule on board,\\nand I imagine our stomachs are running ahead of the chief cook’s\\ndinner bell.”\\n\\n“Well then, we’ll adjust our stomachs to the chef’s timetable!”\\nConseil replied serenely.\\n\\n“There you go again, Conseil my friend!” the impatient Canadian shot\\nback. “You never allow yourself any displays of bile or attacks of\\nnerves! You’re everlastingly calm! You’d say your after-meal grace\\neven if you didn’t get any food for your before-meal blessing—and\\nyou’d starve to death rather than complain!”\\n\\n“What good would it do?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“Complaining doesn’t have to do good, it just feels good! And if these\\npirates—I say pirates out of consideration for the professor’s\\nfeelings, since he doesn’t want us to call them cannibals—if these\\npirates think they’re going to smother me in this cage without hearing\\nwhat cusswords spice up my outbursts, they’ve got another think\\ncoming! Look here, Professor Aronnax, speak frankly. How long do you\\nfigure they’ll keep us in this iron box?”\\n\\n“To tell the truth, friend Land, I know little more about it than you\\ndo.”\\n\\n“But in a nutshell, what do you suppose is going on?”\\n\\n“My supposition is that sheer chance has made us privy to an important\\nsecret. Now then, if the crew of this underwater boat have a personal\\ninterest in keeping that secret, and if their personal interest is\\nmore important than the lives of three men, I believe that our very\\nexistence is in jeopardy. If such is not the case, then at the first\\navailable opportunity, this monster that has swallowed us will return\\nus to the world inhabited by our own kind.”\\n\\n“Unless they recruit us to serve on the crew,” Conseil said, “and keep\\nus here—”\\n\\n“Till the moment,” Ned Land answered, “when some frigate that’s faster\\nor smarter than the Abraham Lincoln captures this den of buccaneers,\\nthen hangs all of us by the neck from the tip of a mainmast yardarm!”\\n\\n“Well thought out, Mr. Land,” I replied. “But as yet, I don’t believe\\nwe’ve been tendered any enlistment offers. Consequently, it’s\\npointless to argue about what tactics we should pursue in such a\\ncase. I repeat: let’s wait, let’s be guided by events, and let’s do\\nnothing, since right now there’s nothing we can do.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, professor,” the harpooner replied, not wanting to\\ngive in. “There is something we can do.”\\n\\n“Oh? And what, Mr. Land?”\\n\\n“Break out of here!”\\n\\n“Breaking out of a prison on shore is difficult enough, but with an\\nunderwater prison, it strikes me as completely unworkable.”\\n\\n“Come now, Ned my friend,” Conseil asked, “how would you answer\\nmaster’s objection? I refuse to believe that an American is at the end\\nof his tether.”\\n\\nVisibly baffled, the harpooner said nothing. Under the conditions in\\nwhich fate had left us, it was absolutely impossible to escape. But a\\nCanadian’s wit is half French, and Mr. Ned Land made this clear in his\\nreply.\\n\\n“So, Professor Aronnax,” he went on after thinking for a few moments,\\n“you haven’t figured out what people do when they can’t escape from\\ntheir prison?”\\n\\n“No, my friend.”\\n\\n“Easy. They fix things so they stay there.”\\n\\n“Of course!” Conseil put in. “Since we’re deep in the ocean, being\\ninside this boat is vastly preferable to being above it or below it!”\\n\\n“But we fix things by kicking out all the jailers, guards, and\\nwardens,” Ned Land added.\\n\\n“What’s this, Ned?” I asked. “You’d seriously consider taking over\\nthis craft?”\\n\\n“Very seriously,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“It’s impossible.”\\n\\n“And why is that, sir? Some promising opportunity might come up, and I\\ndon’t see what could stop us from taking advantage of it. If there are\\nonly about twenty men on board this machine, I don’t think they can\\nstave off two Frenchmen and a Canadian!”\\n\\nIt seemed wiser to accept the harpooner’s proposition than to debate\\nit. Accordingly, I was content to reply:\\n\\n“Let such circumstances come, Mr. Land, and we’ll see. But until then,\\nI beg you to control your impatience. We need to act shrewdly, and\\nyour flare-ups won’t give rise to any promising opportunities. So\\nswear to me that you’ll accept our situation without throwing a\\ntantrum over it.”\\n\\n“I give you my word, professor,” Ned Land replied in an unenthusiastic\\ntone. “No vehement phrases will leave my mouth, no vicious gestures\\nwill give my feelings away, not even when they don’t feed us on time.”\\n\\n“I have your word, Ned,” I answered the Canadian.\\n\\nThen our conversation petered out, and each of us withdrew into his\\nown thoughts. For my part, despite the harpooner’s confident talk, I\\nadmit that I entertained no illusions. I had no faith in those\\npromising opportunities that Ned Land mentioned. To operate with such\\nefficiency, this underwater boat had to have a sizeable crew, so if it\\ncame to a physical contest, we would be facing an overwhelming\\nopponent. Besides, before we could do anything, we had to be free, and\\nthat we definitely were not. I didn’t see any way out of this\\nsheet-iron, hermetically sealed cell. And if the strange commander of\\nthis boat did have a secret to keep—which seemed rather likely—he\\nwould never give us freedom of movement aboard his vessel. Now then,\\nwould he resort to violence in order to be rid of us, or would he drop\\nus off one day on some remote coast? There lay the unknown. All these\\nhypotheses seemed extremely plausible to me, and to hope for freedom\\nthrough use of force, you had to be a harpooner.\\n\\nI realized, moreover, that Ned Land’s brooding was getting him madder\\nby the minute. Little by little, I heard those aforesaid cusswords\\nwelling up in the depths of his gullet, and I saw his movements turn\\nthreatening again. He stood up, pacing in circles like a wild beast in\\na cage, striking the walls with his foot and fist. Meanwhile the hours\\npassed, our hunger nagged unmercifully, and this time the steward did\\nnot appear. Which amounted to forgetting our castaway status for much\\ntoo long, if they really had good intentions toward us.\\n\\nTortured by the growling of his well-built stomach, Ned Land was\\ngetting more and more riled, and despite his word of honor, I was in\\nreal dread of an explosion when he stood in the presence of one of the\\nmen on board.\\n\\nFor two more hours Ned Land’s rage increased. The Canadian shouted and\\npleaded, but to no avail. The sheet-iron walls were deaf. I didn’t\\nhear a single sound inside this dead-seeming boat. The vessel hadn’t\\nstirred, because I obviously would have felt its hull vibrating under\\nthe influence of the propeller. It had undoubtedly sunk into the\\nwatery deep and no longer belonged to the outside world. All this\\ndismal silence was terrifying.\\n\\nAs for our neglect, our isolation in the depths of this cell, I was\\nafraid to guess at how long it might last. Little by little, hopes I\\nhad entertained after our interview with the ship’s commander were\\nfading away. The gentleness of the man’s gaze, the generosity\\nexpressed in his facial features, the nobility of his bearing, all\\nvanished from my memory. I saw this mystifying individual anew for\\nwhat he inevitably must be: cruel and merciless. I viewed him as\\noutside humanity, beyond all feelings of compassion, the implacable\\nfoe of his fellow man, toward whom he must have sworn an undying hate!\\n\\nBut even so, was the man going to let us die of starvation, locked up\\nin this cramped prison, exposed to those horrible temptations to which\\npeople are driven by extreme hunger? This grim possibility took on a\\ndreadful intensity in my mind, and fired by my imagination, I felt an\\nunreasoning terror run through me. Conseil stayed calm. Ned Land\\nbellowed.\\n\\nJust then a noise was audible outside. Footsteps rang on the metal\\ntiling. The locks were turned, the door opened, the steward appeared.\\n\\nBefore I could make a single movement to prevent him, the Canadian\\nrushed at the poor man, threw him down, held him by the throat. The\\nsteward was choking in the grip of those powerful hands.\\n\\nConseil was already trying to loosen the harpooner’s hands from his\\nhalf-suffocated victim, and I had gone to join in the rescue, when I\\nwas abruptly nailed to the spot by these words pronounced in French:\\n\\n“Calm down, Mr. Land! And you, professor, kindly listen to me!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\nThe Man of the Waters\\n\\n\\nIT WAS THE ship’s commander who had just spoken.\\n\\nAt these words Ned Land stood up quickly. Nearly strangled, the\\nsteward staggered out at a signal from his superior; but such was the\\ncommander’s authority aboard his vessel, not one gesture gave away the\\nresentment that this man must have felt toward the Canadian. In\\nsilence we waited for the outcome of this scene; Conseil, in spite of\\nhimself, seemed almost fascinated, I was stunned.\\n\\nArms crossed, leaning against a corner of the table, the commander\\nstudied us with great care. Was he reluctant to speak further? Did he\\nregret those words he had just pronounced in French? You would have\\nthought so.\\n\\nAfter a few moments of silence, which none of us would have dreamed of\\ninterrupting:\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” he said in a calm, penetrating voice, “I speak French,\\nEnglish, German, and Latin with equal fluency. Hence I could have\\nanswered you as early as our initial interview, but first I wanted to\\nmake your acquaintance and then think things over. Your four versions\\nof the same narrative, perfectly consistent by and large, established\\nyour personal identities for me. I now know that sheer chance has\\nplaced in my presence Professor Pierre Aronnax, specialist in natural\\nhistory at the Paris Museum and entrusted with a scientific mission\\nabroad, his manservant Conseil, and Ned Land, a harpooner of Canadian\\norigin aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a frigate in the national navy of\\nthe United States of America.”\\n\\nI bowed in agreement. The commander hadn’t put a question to me. So no\\nanswer was called for. This man expressed himself with perfect ease\\nand without a trace of an accent. His phrasing was clear, his words\\nwell chosen, his facility in elocution remarkable. And yet, to me, he\\ndidn’t have “the feel” of a fellow countryman.\\n\\nHe went on with the conversation as follows:\\n\\n“No doubt, sir, you’ve felt that I waited rather too long before\\npaying you this second visit. After discovering your identities, I\\nwanted to weigh carefully what policy to pursue toward you. I had\\ngreat difficulty deciding. Some extremely inconvenient circumstances\\nhave brought you into the presence of a man who has cut himself off\\nfrom humanity. Your coming has disrupted my whole existence.”\\n\\n“Unintentionally,” I said.\\n\\n“Unintentionally?” the stranger replied, raising his voice a\\nlittle. “Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln hunted me on\\nevery sea? Was it unintentionally that you traveled aboard that\\nfrigate? Was it unintentionally that your shells bounced off my ship’s\\nhull? Was it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land hit me with his\\nharpoon?”\\n\\nI detected a controlled irritation in these words. But there was a\\nperfectly natural reply to these charges, and I made it.\\n\\n“Sir,” I said, “you’re surely unaware of the discussions that have\\ntaken place in Europe and America with yourself as the subject. You\\ndon’t realize that various accidents, caused by collisions with your\\nunderwater machine, have aroused public passions on those two\\ncontinents. I’ll spare you the innumerable hypotheses with which we’ve\\ntried to explain this inexplicable phenomenon, whose secret is yours\\nalone. But please understand that the Abraham Lincoln chased you over\\nthe Pacific high seas in the belief it was hunting some powerful\\nmarine monster, which had to be purged from the ocean at all cost.”\\n\\nA half smile curled the commander’s lips; then, in a calmer tone:\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he replied, “do you dare claim that your frigate\\nwouldn’t have chased and cannonaded an underwater boat as readily as a\\nmonster?”\\n\\nThis question baffled me, since Commander Farragut would certainly\\nhave shown no such hesitation. He would have seen it as his sworn duty\\nto destroy a contrivance of this kind just as promptly as a gigantic\\nnarwhale.\\n\\n“So you understand, sir,” the stranger went on, “that I have a right\\nto treat you as my enemy.”\\n\\nI kept quiet, with good reason. What was the use of debating such a\\nproposition, when superior force can wipe out the best arguments?\\n\\n“It took me a good while to decide,” the commander went on. “Nothing\\nobliged me to grant you hospitality. If I were to part company with\\nyou, I’d have no personal interest in ever seeing you again. I could\\nput you back on the platform of this ship that has served as your\\nrefuge. I could sink under the sea, and I could forget you ever\\nexisted. Wouldn’t that be my right?”\\n\\n“Perhaps it would be the right of a savage,” I replied. “But not that\\nof a civilized man.”\\n\\n“Professor,” the commander replied swiftly, “I’m not what you term a\\ncivilized man! I’ve severed all ties with society, for reasons that I\\nalone have the right to appreciate. Therefore I obey none of its\\nregulations, and I insist that you never invoke them in front of me!”\\n\\nThis was plain speaking. A flash of anger and scorn lit up the\\nstranger’s eyes, and I glimpsed a fearsome past in this man’s\\nlife. Not only had he placed himself beyond human laws, he had\\nrendered himself independent, out of all reach, free in the strictest\\nsense of the word! For who would dare chase him to the depths of the\\nsea when he thwarted all attacks on the surface? What ship could\\nwithstand a collision with his underwater Monitor? What armor plate,\\nno matter how heavy, could bear the thrusts of his spur? No man among\\nmen could call him to account for his actions. God, if he believed in\\nHim, his conscience if he had one—these were the only judges to whom\\nhe was answerable.\\n\\nThese thoughts swiftly crossed my mind while this strange individual\\nfell silent, like someone completely self-absorbed. I regarded him\\nwith a mixture of fear and fascination, in the same way, no doubt,\\nthat Oedipus regarded the Sphinx.\\n\\nAfter a fairly long silence, the commander went on with our\\nconversation.\\n\\n“So I had difficulty deciding,” he said. “But I concluded that my\\npersonal interests could be reconciled with that natural compassion to\\nwhich every human being has a right. Since fate has brought you here,\\nyou’ll stay aboard my vessel. You’ll be free here, and in exchange for\\nthat freedom, moreover totally related to it, I’ll lay on you just one\\ncondition. Your word that you’ll submit to it will be sufficient.”\\n\\n“Go on, sir,” I replied. “I assume this condition is one an honest man\\ncan accept?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Just this. It’s possible that certain unforeseen events may\\nforce me to confine you to your cabins for some hours, or even for\\nsome days as the case may be. Since I prefer never to use violence, I\\nexpect from you in such a case, even more than in any other, your\\nunquestioning obedience. By acting in this way, I shield you from\\ncomplicity, I absolve you of all responsibility, since I myself make\\nit impossible for you to see what you aren’t meant to see. Do you\\naccept this condition?”\\n\\nSo things happened on board that were quite odd to say the least,\\nthings never to be seen by people not placing themselves beyond\\nsociety’s laws! Among all the surprises the future had in store for\\nme, this would not be the mildest.\\n\\n“We accept,” I replied. “Only, I’ll ask your permission, sir, to\\naddress a question to you, just one.”\\n\\n“Go ahead, sir.”\\n\\n“You said we’d be free aboard your vessel?”\\n\\n“Completely.”\\n\\n“Then I would ask what you mean by this freedom.”\\n\\n“Why, the freedom to come, go, see, and even closely observe\\neverything happening here—except under certain rare circumstances—in\\nshort, the freedom we ourselves enjoy, my companions and I.”\\n\\nIt was obvious that we did not understand each other.\\n\\n“Pardon me, sir,” I went on, “but that’s merely the freedom that every\\nprisoner has, the freedom to pace his cell! That’s not enough for us.”\\n\\n“Nevertheless, it will have to do!”\\n\\n“What! We must give up seeing our homeland, friends, and relatives\\never again?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. But giving up that intolerable earthly yoke that some men\\ncall freedom is perhaps less painful than you think!”\\n\\n“By thunder!” Ned Land shouted. “I’ll never promise I won’t try\\ngetting out of here!”\\n\\n“I didn’t ask for such a promise, Mr. Land,” the commander replied\\ncoldly.\\n\\n“Sir,” I replied, flaring up in spite of myself, “you’re taking unfair\\nadvantage of us! This is sheer cruelty!”\\n\\n“No, sir, it’s an act of mercy! You’re my prisoners of war! I’ve cared\\nfor you when, with a single word, I could plunge you back into the\\nocean depths! You attacked me! You’ve just stumbled on a secret no\\nliving man must probe, the secret of my entire existence! Do you think\\nI’ll send you back to a world that must know nothing more of me?\\nNever! By keeping you on board, it isn’t you whom I care for, it’s\\nme!”\\n\\nThese words indicated that the commander pursued a policy impervious\\nto arguments.\\n\\n“Then, sir,” I went on, “you give us, quite simply, a choice between\\nlife and death?”\\n\\n“Quite simply.”\\n\\n“My friends,” I said, “to a question couched in these terms, our\\nanswer can be taken for granted. But no solemn promises bind us to the\\ncommander of this vessel.”\\n\\n“None, sir,” the stranger replied.\\n\\nThen, in a gentler voice, he went on:\\n\\n“Now, allow me to finish what I have to tell you. I’ve heard of you,\\nProfessor Aronnax. You, if not your companions, won’t perhaps complain\\ntoo much about the stroke of fate that has brought us together. Among\\nthe books that make up my favorite reading, you’ll find the work\\nyou’ve published on the great ocean depths. I’ve pored over it. You’ve\\ntaken your studies as far as terrestrial science can go. But you don’t\\nknow everything because you haven’t seen everything. Let me tell you,\\nprofessor, you won’t regret the time you spend aboard my\\nvessel. You’re going to voyage through a land of wonders. Stunned\\namazement will probably be your habitual state of mind. It will be a\\nlong while before you tire of the sights constantly before your\\neyes. I’m going to make another underwater tour of the world—perhaps\\nmy last, who knows?—and I’ll review everything I’ve studied in the\\ndepths of these seas that I’ve crossed so often, and you can be my\\nfellow student. Starting this very day, you’ll enter a new element,\\nyou’ll see what no human being has ever seen before—since my men and I\\nno longer count—and thanks to me, you’re going to learn the ultimate\\nsecrets of our planet.”\\n\\nI can’t deny it; the commander’s words had a tremendous effect on\\nme. He had caught me on my weak side, and I momentarily forgot that\\nnot even this sublime experience was worth the loss of my\\nfreedom. Besides, I counted on the future to resolve this important\\nquestion. So I was content to reply:\\n\\n“Sir, even though you’ve cut yourself off from humanity, I can see\\nthat you haven’t disowned all human feeling. We’re castaways whom\\nyou’ve charitably taken aboard, we’ll never forget that. Speaking for\\nmyself, I don’t rule out that the interests of science could override\\neven the need for freedom, which promises me that, in exchange, our\\nencounter will provide great rewards.”\\n\\nI thought the commander would offer me his hand, to seal our\\nagreement. He did nothing of the sort. I regretted that.\\n\\n“One last question,” I said, just as this inexplicable being seemed\\nready to withdraw.\\n\\n“Ask it, professor.”\\n\\n“By what name am I to call you?”\\n\\n“Sir,” the commander replied, “to you, I’m simply Captain Nemo;* to\\nme, you and your companions are simply passengers on the Nautilus.”\\n\\n*Latin: nemo means “no one.” Ed.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo called out. A steward appeared. The captain gave him his\\norders in that strange language I couldn’t even identify. Then,\\nturning to the Canadian and Conseil:\\n\\n“A meal is waiting for you in your cabin,” he told them. “Kindly\\nfollow this man.”\\n\\n“That’s an offer I can’t refuse!” the harpooner replied.\\n\\nAfter being confined for over thirty hours, he and Conseil were\\nfinally out of this cell.\\n\\n“And now, Professor Aronnax, our own breakfast is ready. Allow me to\\nlead the way.”\\n\\n“Yours to command, captain.”\\n\\nI followed Captain Nemo, and as soon as I passed through the doorway,\\nI went down a kind of electrically lit passageway that resembled a\\ngangway on a ship. After a stretch of some ten meters, a second door\\nopened before me.\\n\\nI then entered a dining room, decorated and furnished in austere good\\ntaste. Inlaid with ebony trim, tall oaken sideboards stood at both\\nends of this room, and sparkling on their shelves were staggered rows\\nof earthenware, porcelain, and glass of incalculable value. There\\nsilver-plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light\\nfixtures in the ceiling, whose glare was softened and tempered by\\ndelicately painted designs.\\n\\nIn the center of this room stood a table, richly spread. Captain Nemo\\nindicated the place I was to occupy.\\n\\n“Be seated,” he told me, “and eat like the famished man you must be.”\\n\\nOur breakfast consisted of several dishes whose contents were all\\nsupplied by the sea, and some foods whose nature and derivation were\\nunknown to me. They were good, I admit, but with a peculiar flavor to\\nwhich I would soon grow accustomed. These various food items seemed to\\nbe rich in phosphorous, and I thought that they, too, must have been\\nof marine origin.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stared at me. I had asked him nothing, but he read my\\nthoughts, and on his own he answered the questions I was itching to\\naddress him.\\n\\n“Most of these dishes are new to you,” he told me. “But you can\\nconsume them without fear. They’re healthy and nourishing. I renounced\\nterrestrial foods long ago, and I’m none the worse for it. My crew are\\nstrong and full of energy, and they eat what I eat.”\\n\\n“So,” I said, “all these foods are products of the sea?”\\n\\n“Yes, professor, the sea supplies all my needs. Sometimes I cast my\\nnets in our wake, and I pull them up ready to burst. Sometimes I go\\nhunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far\\nout of man’s reach, and I corner the game that dwells in my underwater\\nforests. Like the flocks of old Proteus, King Neptune’s shepherd, my\\nherds graze without fear on the ocean’s immense prairies. There I own\\nvast properties that I harvest myself, and which are forever sown by\\nthe hand of the Creator of All Things.”\\n\\nI stared at Captain Nemo in definite astonishment, and I answered him:\\n\\n“Sir, I understand perfectly how your nets can furnish excellent fish\\nfor your table; I understand less how you can chase aquatic game in\\nyour underwater forests; but how a piece of red meat, no matter how\\nsmall, can figure in your menu, that I don’t understand at all.”\\n\\n“Nor I, sir,” Captain Nemo answered me. “I never touch the flesh of\\nland animals.”\\n\\n“Nevertheless, this . . . ,” I went on, pointing to a dish where some\\nslices of loin were still left.\\n\\n“What you believe to be red meat, professor, is nothing other than\\nloin of sea turtle. Similarly, here are some dolphin livers you might\\nmistake for stewed pork. My chef is a skillful food processor who\\nexcels at pickling and preserving these various exhibits from the\\nocean. Feel free to sample all of these foods. Here are some preserves\\nof sea cucumber that a Malaysian would declare to be unrivaled in the\\nentire world, here’s cream from milk furnished by the udders of\\ncetaceans, and sugar from the huge fucus plants in the North Sea; and\\nfinally, allow me to offer you some marmalade of sea anemone, equal to\\nthat from the tastiest fruits.”\\n\\nSo I sampled away, more as a curiosity seeker than an epicure, while\\nCaptain Nemo delighted me with his incredible anecdotes.\\n\\n“But this sea, Professor Aronnax,” he told me, “this prodigious,\\ninexhaustible wet nurse of a sea not only feeds me, she dresses me as\\nwell. That fabric covering you was woven from the masses of filaments\\nthat anchor certain seashells; as the ancients were wont to do, it was\\ndyed with purple ink from the murex snail and shaded with violet tints\\nthat I extract from a marine slug, the Mediterranean sea hare. The\\nperfumes you’ll find on the washstand in your cabin were produced from\\nthe oozings of marine plants. Your mattress was made from the ocean’s\\nsoftest eelgrass. Your quill pen will be whalebone, your ink a juice\\nsecreted by cuttlefish or squid. Everything comes to me from the sea,\\njust as someday everything will return to it!”\\n\\n“You love the sea, captain.”\\n\\n“Yes, I love it! The sea is the be all and end all! It covers\\nseven-tenths of the planet earth. Its breath is clean and\\nhealthy. It’s an immense wilderness where a man is never lonely,\\nbecause he feels life astir on every side. The sea is simply the\\nvehicle for a prodigious, unearthly mode of existence; it’s simply\\nmovement and love; it’s living infinity, as one of your poets put\\nit. And in essence, professor, nature is here made manifest by all\\nthree of her kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, and animal. The last of\\nthese is amply represented by the four zoophyte groups, three classes\\nof articulates, five classes of mollusks, and three vertebrate\\nclasses: mammals, reptiles, and those countless legions of fish, an\\ninfinite order of animals totaling more than 13,000 species, of which\\nonly one-tenth belong to fresh water. The sea is a vast pool of\\nnature. Our globe began with the sea, so to speak, and who can say we\\nwon’t end with it! Here lies supreme tranquility. The sea doesn’t\\nbelong to tyrants. On its surface they can still exercise their\\niniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every\\nearthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion\\nceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live!\\nLive in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence! Here I\\nrecognize no superiors! Here I’m free!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo suddenly fell silent in the midst of this enthusiastic\\noutpouring. Had he let himself get carried away, past the bounds of\\nhis habitual reserve? Had he said too much? For a few moments he\\nstrolled up and down, all aquiver. Then his nerves grew calmer, his\\nfacial features recovered their usual icy composure, and turning to\\nme:\\n\\n“Now, professor,” he said, “if you’d like to inspect the Nautilus, I’m\\nyours to command.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\nThe Nautilus\\n\\n\\nCAPTAIN NEMO stood up. I followed him. Contrived at the rear of the\\ndining room, a double door opened, and I entered a room whose\\ndimensions equaled the one I had just left.\\n\\nIt was a library. Tall, black-rosewood bookcases, inlaid with\\ncopperwork, held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly\\nbound books. These furnishings followed the contours of the room,\\ntheir lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon\\nleather and curved for maximum comfort. Light, movable reading stands,\\nwhich could be pushed away or pulled near as desired, allowed books to\\nbe positioned on them for easy study. In the center stood a huge table\\ncovered with pamphlets, among which some newspapers, long out of date,\\nwere visible. Electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality,\\nfalling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the\\nceiling. I stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously\\nlaid out, and I couldn’t believe my eyes.\\n\\n“Captain Nemo,” I told my host, who had just stretched out on a couch,\\n“this is a library that would do credit to more than one continental\\npalace, and I truly marvel to think it can go with you into the\\ndeepest seas.”\\n\\n“Where could one find greater silence or solitude, professor?” Captain\\nNemo replied. “Did your study at the museum afford you such a perfect\\nretreat?”\\n\\n“No, sir, and I might add that it’s quite a humble one next to\\nyours. You own 6,000 or 7,000 volumes here . . .”\\n\\n“12,000, Professor Aronnax. They’re my sole remaining ties with dry\\nland. But I was done with the shore the day my Nautilus submerged for\\nthe first time under the waters. That day I purchased my last volumes,\\nmy last pamphlets, my last newspapers, and ever since I’ve chosen to\\nbelieve that humanity no longer thinks or writes. In any event,\\nprofessor, these books are at your disposal, and you may use them\\nfreely.”\\n\\nI thanked Captain Nemo and approached the shelves of this\\nlibrary. Written in every language, books on science, ethics, and\\nliterature were there in abundance, but I didn’t see a single work on\\neconomics—they seemed to be strictly banned on board. One odd detail:\\nall these books were shelved indiscriminately without regard to the\\nlanguage in which they were written, and this jumble proved that the\\nNautilus’s captain could read fluently whatever volumes he chanced to\\npick up.\\n\\nAmong these books I noted masterpieces by the greats of ancient and\\nmodern times, in other words, all of humanity’s finest achievements in\\nhistory, poetry, fiction, and science, from Homer to Victor Hugo, from\\nXenophon to Michelet, from Rabelais to Madame George Sand. But\\nscience, in particular, represented the major investment of this\\nlibrary: books on mechanics, ballistics, hydrography, meteorology,\\ngeography, geology, etc., held a place there no less important than\\nworks on natural history, and I realized that they made up the\\ncaptain’s chief reading. There I saw the complete works of Humboldt,\\nthe complete Arago, as well as works by Foucault, Henri Sainte-Claire\\nDeville, Chasles, Milne-Edwards, Quatrefages, John Tyndall, Faraday,\\nBerthelot, Father Secchi, Petermann, Commander Maury, Louis Agassiz,\\netc., plus the transactions of France’s Academy of Sciences, bulletins\\nfrom the various geographical societies, etc., and in a prime\\nlocation, those two volumes on the great ocean depths that had perhaps\\nearned me this comparatively charitable welcome from Captain\\nNemo. Among the works of Joseph Bertrand, his book entitled The\\nFounders of Astronomy even gave me a definite date; and since I knew\\nit had appeared in the course of 1865, I concluded that the fitting\\nout of the Nautilus hadn’t taken place before then. Accordingly, three\\nyears ago at the most, Captain Nemo had begun his underwater\\nexistence. Moreover, I hoped some books even more recent would permit\\nme to pinpoint the date precisely; but I had plenty of time to look\\nfor them, and I didn’t want to put off any longer our stroll through\\nthe wonders of the Nautilus.\\n\\n“Sir,” I told the captain, “thank you for placing this library at my\\ndisposal. There are scientific treasures here, and I’ll take advantage\\nof them.”\\n\\n“This room isn’t only a library,” Captain Nemo said, “it’s also a\\nsmoking room.”\\n\\n“A smoking room?” I exclaimed. “Then one may smoke on board?”\\n\\n“Surely.”\\n\\n“In that case, sir, I’m forced to believe that you’ve kept up\\nrelations with Havana.”\\n\\n“None whatever,” the captain replied. “Try this cigar, Professor\\nAronnax, and even though it doesn’t come from Havana, it will satisfy\\nyou if you’re a connoisseur.”\\n\\nI took the cigar offered me, whose shape recalled those from Cuba; but\\nit seemed to be made of gold leaf. I lit it at a small brazier\\nsupported by an elegant bronze stand, and I inhaled my first whiffs\\nwith the relish of a smoker who hasn’t had a puff in days.\\n\\n“It’s excellent,” I said, “but it’s not from the tobacco plant.”\\n\\n“Right,” the captain replied, “this tobacco comes from neither Havana\\nnor the Orient. It’s a kind of nicotine-rich seaweed that the ocean\\nsupplies me, albeit sparingly. Do you still miss your Cubans, sir?”\\n\\n“Captain, I scorn them from this day forward.”\\n\\n“Then smoke these cigars whenever you like, without debating their\\norigin. They bear no government seal of approval, but I imagine\\nthey’re none the worse for it.”\\n\\n“On the contrary.”\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo opened a door facing the one by which I had\\nentered the library, and I passed into an immense, splendidly lit\\nlounge.\\n\\nIt was a huge quadrilateral with canted corners, ten meters long, six\\nwide, five high. A luminous ceiling, decorated with delicate\\narabesques, distributed a soft, clear daylight over all the wonders\\ngathered in this museum. For a museum it truly was, in which clever\\nhands had spared no expense to amass every natural and artistic\\ntreasure, displaying them with the helter-skelter picturesqueness that\\ndistinguishes a painter’s studio.\\n\\nSome thirty pictures by the masters, uniformly framed and separated by\\ngleaming panoplies of arms, adorned walls on which were stretched\\ntapestries of austere design. There I saw canvases of the highest\\nvalue, the likes of which I had marveled at in private European\\ncollections and art exhibitions. The various schools of the old\\nmasters were represented by a Raphael Madonna, a Virgin by Leonardo da\\nVinci, a nymph by Correggio, a woman by Titian, an adoration of the\\nMagi by Veronese, an assumption of the Virgin by Murillo, a Holbein\\nportrait, a monk by Velazquez, a martyr by Ribera, a village fair by\\nRubens, two Flemish landscapes by Teniers, three little genre\\npaintings by Gerard Dow, Metsu, and Paul Potter, two canvases by\\nGericault and Prud’hon, plus seascapes by Backhuysen and Vernet. Among\\nthe works of modern art were pictures signed by Delacroix, Ingres,\\nDecamps, Troyon, Meissonier, Daubigny, etc., and some wonderful\\nminiature statues in marble or bronze, modeled after antiquity’s\\nfinest originals, stood on their pedestals in the corners of this\\nmagnificent museum. As the Nautilus’s commander had predicted, my mind\\nwas already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned\\namazement.\\n\\n“Professor,” this strange man then said, “you must excuse the\\ninformality with which I receive you, and the disorder reigning in\\nthis lounge.”\\n\\n“Sir,” I replied, “without prying into who you are, might I venture to\\nidentify you as an artist?”\\n\\n“A collector, sir, nothing more. Formerly I loved acquiring these\\nbeautiful works created by the hand of man. I sought them greedily,\\nferreted them out tirelessly, and I’ve been able to gather some\\nobjects of great value. They’re my last mementos of those shores that\\nare now dead for me. In my eyes, your modern artists are already as\\nold as the ancients. They’ve existed for 2,000 or 3,000 years, and I\\nmix them up in my mind. The masters are ageless.”\\n\\n“What about these composers?” I said, pointing to sheet music by\\nWeber, Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Hérold, Wagner,\\nAuber, Gounod, Victor Massé, and a number of others scattered over a\\nfull size piano-organ, which occupied one of the wall panels in this\\nlounge.\\n\\n“These composers,” Captain Nemo answered me, “are the contemporaries\\nof Orpheus, because in the annals of the dead, all chronological\\ndifferences fade; and I’m dead, professor, quite as dead as those\\nfriends of yours sleeping six feet under!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo fell silent and seemed lost in reverie. I regarded him\\nwith intense excitement, silently analyzing his strange facial\\nexpression. Leaning his elbow on the corner of a valuable mosaic\\ntable, he no longer saw me, he had forgotten my very presence.\\n\\nI didn’t disturb his meditations but continued to pass in review the\\ncuriosities that enriched this lounge.\\n\\nAfter the works of art, natural rarities predominated. They consisted\\nchiefly of plants, shells, and other exhibits from the ocean that must\\nhave been Captain Nemo’s own personal finds. In the middle of the\\nlounge, a jet of water, electrically lit, fell back into a basin made\\nfrom a single giant clam. The delicately festooned rim of this shell,\\nsupplied by the biggest mollusk in the class Acephala, measured about\\nsix meters in circumference; so it was even bigger than those fine\\ngiant clams given to King Franτois I by the Republic of Venice, and\\nwhich the Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris has made into two gigantic\\nholy-water fonts.\\n\\nAround this basin, inside elegant glass cases fastened with copper\\nbands, there were classified and labeled the most valuable marine\\nexhibits ever put before the eyes of a naturalist. My professorial\\nglee may easily be imagined.\\n\\nThe zoophyte branch offered some very unusual specimens from its two\\ngroups, the polyps and the echinoderms. In the first group: organ-pipe\\ncoral, gorgonian coral arranged into fan shapes, soft sponges from\\nSyria, isis coral from the Molucca Islands, sea-pen coral, wonderful\\ncoral of the genus Virgularia from the waters of Norway, various coral\\nof the genus Umbellularia, alcyonarian coral, then a whole series of\\nthose madrepores that my mentor Professor Milne-Edwards has so\\nshrewdly classified into divisions and among which I noted the\\nwonderful genus Flabellina as well as the genus Oculina from RΘunion\\nIsland, plus a “Neptune’s chariot” from the Caribbean Sea—every superb\\nvariety of coral, and in short, every species of these unusual\\npolyparies that congregate to form entire islands that will one day\\nturn into continents. Among the echinoderms, notable for being covered\\nwith spines: starfish, feather stars, sea lilies, free-swimming\\ncrinoids, brittle stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, etc., represented\\na complete collection of the individuals in this group.\\n\\nAn excitable conchologist would surely have fainted dead away before\\nother, more numerous glass cases in which were classified specimens\\nfrom the mollusk branch. There I saw a collection of incalculable\\nvalue that I haven’t time to describe completely. Among these exhibits\\nI’ll mention, just for the record: an elegant royal hammer shell from\\nthe Indian Ocean, whose evenly spaced white spots stood out sharply\\nagainst a base of red and brown; an imperial spiny oyster, brightly\\ncolored, bristling with thorns, a specimen rare to European museums,\\nwhose value I estimated at 20,000 francs; a common hammer shell from\\nthe seas near Queensland, very hard to come by; exotic cockles from\\nSenegal, fragile white bivalve shells that a single breath could pop\\nlike a soap bubble; several varieties of watering-pot shell from Java,\\na sort of limestone tube fringed with leafy folds and much fought over\\nby collectors; a whole series of top-shell snails—greenish yellow ones\\nfished up from American seas, others colored reddish brown that\\npatronize the waters off Queensland, the former coming from the Gulf\\nof Mexico and notable for their overlapping shells, the latter some\\nsun-carrier shells found in the southernmost seas, finally and rarest\\nof all, the magnificent spurred-star shell from New Zealand; then some\\nwonderful peppery-furrow shells; several valuable species of cythera\\nclams and venus clams; the trellis wentletrap snail from Tranquebar on\\nIndia’s eastern shore; a marbled turban snail gleaming with\\nmother-of-pearl; green parrot shells from the seas of China; the\\nvirtually unknown cone snail from the genus Coenodullus; every variety\\nof cowry used as money in India and Africa; a “glory-of-the-seas,” the\\nmost valuable shell in the East Indies; finally, common periwinkles,\\ndelphinula snails, turret snails, violet snails, European cowries,\\nvolute snails, olive shells, miter shells, helmet shells, murex\\nsnails, whelks, harp shells, spiky periwinkles, triton snails, horn\\nshells, spindle shells, conch shells, spider conchs, limpets, glass\\nsnails, sea butterflies—every kind of delicate, fragile seashell that\\nscience has baptized with its most delightful names.\\n\\nAside and in special compartments, strings of supremely beautiful\\npearls were spread out, the electric light flecking them with little\\nfiery sparks: pink pearls pulled from saltwater fan shells in the Red\\nSea; green pearls from the rainbow abalone; yellow, blue, and black\\npearls, the unusual handiwork of various mollusks from every ocean and\\nof certain mussels from rivers up north; in short, several specimens\\nof incalculable worth that had been oozed by the rarest of\\nshellfish. Some of these pearls were bigger than a pigeon egg; they\\nmore than equaled the one that the explorer Tavernier sold the Shah of\\nPersia for 3,000,000 francs, and they surpassed that other pearl owned\\nby the Imam of Muscat, which I had believed to be unrivaled in the\\nentire world.\\n\\nConsequently, to calculate the value of this collection was, I should\\nsay, impossible. Captain Nemo must have spent millions in acquiring\\nthese different specimens, and I was wondering what financial\\nresources he tapped to satisfy his collector’s fancies, when these\\nwords interrupted me:\\n\\n“You’re examining my shells, professor? They’re indeed able to\\nfascinate a naturalist; but for me they have an added charm, since\\nI’ve collected every one of them with my own two hands, and not a sea\\non the globe has escaped my investigations.”\\n\\n“I understand, captain, I understand your delight at strolling in the\\nmidst of this wealth. You’re a man who gathers his treasure in\\nperson. No museum in Europe owns such a collection of exhibits from\\nthe ocean. But if I exhaust all my wonderment on them, I’ll have\\nnothing left for the ship that carries them! I have absolutely no wish\\nto probe those secrets of yours! But I confess that my curiosity is\\naroused to the limit by this Nautilus, the motor power it contains,\\nthe equipment enabling it to operate, the ultra powerful force that\\nbrings it to life. I see some instruments hanging on the walls of this\\nlounge whose purposes are unknown to me. May I learn—”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo answered me, “I’ve said you’d be\\nfree aboard my vessel, so no part of the Nautilus is off-limits to\\nyou. You may inspect it in detail, and I’ll be delighted to act as\\nyour guide.”\\n\\n“I don’t know how to thank you, sir, but I won’t abuse your good\\nnature. I would only ask you about the uses intended for these\\ninstruments of physical measure—”\\n\\n“Professor, these same instruments are found in my stateroom, where\\nI’ll have the pleasure of explaining their functions to you. But\\nbeforehand, come inspect the cabin set aside for you. You need to\\nlearn how you’ll be lodged aboard the Nautilus.”\\n\\nI followed Captain Nemo, who, via one of the doors cut into the\\nlounge’s canted corners, led me back down the ship’s gangways. He took\\nme to the bow, and there I found not just a cabin but an elegant\\nstateroom with a bed, a washstand, and various other furnishings.\\n\\nI could only thank my host.\\n\\n“Your stateroom adjoins mine,” he told me, opening a door, “and mine\\nleads into that lounge we’ve just left.”\\n\\nI entered the captain’s stateroom. It had an austere, almost monastic\\nappearance. An iron bedstead, a worktable, some washstand\\nfixtures. Subdued lighting. No luxuries. Just the bare necessities.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo showed me to a bench.\\n\\n“Kindly be seated,” he told me.\\n\\nI sat, and he began speaking as follows:\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\nEverything through Electricity\\n\\n\\n“SIR,” CAPTAIN NEMO SAID, showing me the instruments hanging on the\\nwalls of his stateroom, “these are the devices needed to navigate the\\nNautilus. Here, as in the lounge, I always have them before my eyes,\\nand they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the\\nocean. You’re familiar with some of them, such as the thermometer,\\nwhich gives the temperature inside the Nautilus; the barometer, which\\nmeasures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the\\nweather; the humidistat, which indicates the degree of dryness in the\\natmosphere; the storm glass, whose mixture decomposes to foretell the\\narrival of tempests; the compass, which steers my course; the sextant,\\nwhich takes the sun’s altitude and tells me my latitude; chronometers,\\nwhich allow me to calculate my longitude; and finally, spyglasses for\\nboth day and night, enabling me to scrutinize every point of the\\nhorizon once the Nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves.”\\n\\n“These are the normal navigational instruments,” I replied, “and I’m\\nfamiliar with their uses. But no doubt these others answer pressing\\nneeds unique to the Nautilus. That dial I see there, with the needle\\nmoving across it—isn’t it a pressure gauge?”\\n\\n“It is indeed a pressure gauge. It’s placed in contact with the water,\\nand it indicates the outside pressure on our hull, which in turn gives\\nme the depth at which my submersible is sitting.”\\n\\n“And these are some new breed of sounding line?”\\n\\n“They’re thermometric sounding lines that report water temperatures in\\nthe different strata.”\\n\\n“And these other instruments, whose functions I can’t even guess?”\\n\\n“Here, professor, I need to give you some background information,”\\nCaptain Nemo said. “So kindly hear me out.”\\n\\nHe fell silent for some moments, then he said:\\n\\n“There’s a powerful, obedient, swift, and effortless force that can be\\nbent to any use and which reigns supreme aboard my vessel. It does\\neverything. It lights me, it warms me, it’s the soul of my mechanical\\nequipment. This force is electricity.”\\n\\n“Electricity!” I exclaimed in some surprise.\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“But, captain, you have a tremendous speed of movement that doesn’t\\nsquare with the strength of electricity. Until now, its dynamic\\npotential has remained quite limited, capable of producing only small\\namounts of power!”\\n\\n“Professor,” Captain Nemo replied, “my electricity isn’t the\\nrun-of-the-mill variety, and with your permission, I’ll leave it at\\nthat.”\\n\\n“I won’t insist, sir, and I’ll rest content with simply being\\nflabbergasted at your results. I would ask one question, however,\\nwhich you needn’t answer if it’s indiscreet. The electric cells you\\nuse to generate this marvelous force must be depleted very\\nquickly. Their zinc component, for example: how do you replace it,\\nsince you no longer stay in contact with the shore?”\\n\\n“That question deserves an answer,” Captain Nemo replied. “First off,\\nI’ll mention that at the bottom of the sea there exist veins of zinc,\\niron, silver, and gold whose mining would quite certainly be\\nfeasible. But I’ve tapped none of these land-based metals, and I\\nwanted to make demands only on the sea itself for the sources of my\\nelectricity.”\\n\\n“The sea itself?”\\n\\n“Yes, professor, and there was no shortage of such sources. In fact,\\nby establishing a circuit between two wires immersed to different\\ndepths, I’d be able to obtain electricity through the diverging\\ntemperatures they experience; but I preferred to use a more practical\\nprocedure.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“You’re familiar with the composition of salt water. In 1,000 grams\\none finds 96.5% water and about 2.66% sodium chloride; then small\\nquantities of magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium\\nbromide, sulfate of magnesia, calcium sulfate, and calcium\\ncarbonate. Hence you observe that sodium chloride is encountered there\\nin significant proportions. Now then, it’s this sodium that I extract\\nfrom salt water and with which I compose my electric cells.”\\n\\n“Sodium?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Mixed with mercury, it forms an amalgam that takes the\\nplace of zinc in Bunsen cells. The mercury is never depleted. Only the\\nsodium is consumed, and the sea itself gives me that. Beyond this,\\nI’ll mention that sodium batteries have been found to generate the\\ngreater energy, and their electro-motor strength is twice that of zinc\\nbatteries.”\\n\\n“Captain, I fully understand the excellence of sodium under the\\nconditions in which you’re placed. The sea contains it. Fine. But it\\nstill has to be produced, in short, extracted. And how do you\\naccomplish this? Obviously your batteries could do the extracting; but\\nif I’m not mistaken, the consumption of sodium needed by your electric\\nequipment would be greater than the quantity you’d extract. It would\\ncome about, then, that in the process of producing your sodium, you’d\\nuse up more than you’d make!”\\n\\n“Accordingly, professor, I don’t extract it with batteries; quite\\nsimply, I utilize the heat of coal from the earth.”\\n\\n“From the earth?” I said, my voice going up on the word.\\n\\n“We’ll say coal from the seafloor, if you prefer,” Captain Nemo\\nreplied.\\n\\n“And you can mine these veins of underwater coal?”\\n\\n“You’ll watch me work them, Professor Aronnax. I ask only a little\\npatience of you, since you’ll have ample time to be patient. Just\\nremember one thing: I owe everything to the ocean; it generates\\nelectricity, and electricity gives the Nautilus heat, light, motion,\\nand, in a word, life itself.”\\n\\n“But not the air you breathe?”\\n\\n“Oh, I could produce the air needed on board, but it would be\\npointless, since I can rise to the surface of the sea whenever I\\nlike. However, even though electricity doesn’t supply me with\\nbreathable air, it at least operates the powerful pumps that store it\\nunder pressure in special tanks; which, if need be, allows me to\\nextend my stay in the lower strata for as long as I want.”\\n\\n“Captain,” I replied, “I’ll rest content with marveling. You’ve\\nobviously found what all mankind will surely find one day, the true\\ndynamic power of electricity.”\\n\\n“I’m not so certain they’ll find it,” Captain Nemo replied icily. “But\\nbe that as it may, you’re already familiar with the first use I’ve\\nfound for this valuable force. It lights us, and with a uniformity and\\ncontinuity not even possessed by sunlight. Now, look at that clock:\\nit’s electric, it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest\\nchronometers. I’ve had it divided into twenty-four hours like Italian\\nclocks, since neither day nor night, sun nor moon, exist for me, but\\nonly this artificial light that I import into the depths of the seas!\\nSee, right now it’s ten o’clock in the morning.”\\n\\n“That’s perfect.”\\n\\n“Another use for electricity: that dial hanging before our eyes\\nindicates how fast the Nautilus is going. An electric wire puts it in\\ncontact with the patent log; this needle shows me the actual speed of\\nmy submersible. And . . . hold on . . . just now we’re proceeding at\\nthe moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour.”\\n\\n“It’s marvelous,” I replied, “and I truly see, captain, how right you\\nare to use this force; it’s sure to take the place of wind, water, and\\nsteam.”\\n\\n“But that’s not all, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo said, standing\\nup. “And if you’d care to follow me, we’ll inspect the Nautilus’s\\nstern.”\\n\\nIn essence, I was already familiar with the whole forward part of this\\nunderwater boat, and here are its exact subdivisions going from\\namidships to its spur: the dining room, 5 meters long and separated\\nfrom the library by a watertight bulkhead, in other words, it couldn’t\\nbe penetrated by the sea; the library, 5 meters long; the main lounge,\\n10 meters long, separated from the captain’s stateroom by a second\\nwatertight bulkhead; the aforesaid stateroom, 5 meters long; mine, 2.5\\nmeters long; and finally, air tanks 7.5 meters long and extending to\\nthe stempost. Total: a length of 35 meters. Doors were cut into the\\nwatertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically by means of\\nindia-rubber seals, which insured complete safety aboard the Nautilus\\nin the event of a leak in any one section.\\n\\nI followed Captain Nemo down gangways located for easy transit, and I\\narrived amidships. There I found a sort of shaft heading upward\\nbetween two watertight bulkheads. An iron ladder, clamped to the wall,\\nled to the shaft’s upper end. I asked the captain what this ladder was\\nfor.\\n\\n“It goes to the skiff,” he replied.\\n\\n“What! You have a skiff?” I replied in some astonishment.\\n\\n“Surely. An excellent longboat, light and unsinkable, which is used\\nfor excursions and fishing trips.”\\n\\n“But when you want to set out, don’t you have to return to the surface\\nof the sea?”\\n\\n“By no means. The skiff is attached to the topside of the Nautilus’s\\nhull and is set in a cavity expressly designed to receive it. It’s\\ncompletely decked over, absolutely watertight, and held solidly in\\nplace by bolts. This ladder leads to a manhole cut into the Nautilus’s\\nhull and corresponding to a comparable hole cut into the side of the\\nskiff. I insert myself through this double opening into the\\nlongboat. My crew close up the hole belonging to the Nautilus; I close\\nup the one belonging to the skiff, simply by screwing it into place. I\\nundo the bolts holding the skiff to the submersible, and the longboat\\nrises with prodigious speed to the surface of the sea. I then open the\\ndeck paneling, carefully closed until that point; I up mast and hoist\\nsail—or I take out my oars—and I go for a spin.”\\n\\n“But how do you return to the ship?”\\n\\n“I don’t, Professor Aronnax; the Nautilus returns to me.”\\n\\n“At your command?”\\n\\n“At my command. An electric wire connects me to the ship. I fire off a\\ntelegram, and that’s that.”\\n\\n“Right,” I said, tipsy from all these wonders, “nothing to it!”\\n\\nAfter passing the well of the companionway that led to the platform, I\\nsaw a cabin 2 meters long in which Conseil and Ned Land, enraptured\\nwith their meal, were busy devouring it to the last crumb. Then a door\\nopened into the galley, 3 meters long and located between the vessel’s\\nhuge storage lockers.\\n\\nThere, even more powerful and obedient than gas, electricity did most\\nof the cooking. Arriving under the stoves, wires transmitted to\\nplatinum griddles a heat that was distributed and sustained with\\nperfect consistency. It also heated a distilling mechanism that, via\\nevaporation, supplied excellent drinking water. Next to this galley\\nwas a bathroom, conveniently laid out, with faucets supplying hot or\\ncold water at will.\\n\\nAfter the galley came the crew’s quarters, 5 meters long. But the door\\nwas closed and I couldn’t see its accommodations, which might have\\ntold me the number of men it took to operate the Nautilus.\\n\\nAt the far end stood a fourth watertight bulkhead, separating the\\ncrew’s quarters from the engine room. A door opened, and I stood in\\nthe compartment where Captain Nemo, indisputably a world-class\\nengineer, had set up his locomotive equipment.\\n\\nBrightly lit, the engine room measured at least 20 meters in\\nlength. It was divided, by function, into two parts: the first\\ncontained the cells for generating electricity, the second that\\nmechanism transmitting movement to the propeller.\\n\\nRight off, I detected an odor permeating the compartment that was sui\\ngeneris.* Captain Nemo noticed the negative impression it made on me.\\n\\n*Latin: “in a class by itself.” Ed.\\n\\n“That,” he told me, “is a gaseous discharge caused by our use of\\nsodium, but it’s only a mild inconvenience. In any event, every\\nmorning we sanitize the ship by ventilating it in the open air.”\\n\\nMeanwhile I examined the Nautilus’s engine with a fascination easy to\\nimagine.\\n\\n“You observe,” Captain Nemo told me, “that I use Bunsen cells, not\\nRuhmkorff cells. The latter would be ineffectual. One uses fewer\\nBunsen cells, but they’re big and strong, and experience has proven\\ntheir superiority. The electricity generated here makes its way to the\\nstern, where electromagnets of huge size activate a special system of\\nlevers and gears that transmit movement to the propeller’s shaft. The\\nlatter has a diameter of 6 meters, a pitch of 7.5 meters, and can do\\nup to 120 revolutions per minute.”\\n\\n“And that gives you?”\\n\\n“A speed of fifty miles per hour.”\\n\\nThere lay a mystery, but I didn’t insist on exploring it. How could\\nelectricity work with such power? Where did this nearly unlimited\\nenergy originate? Was it in the extraordinary voltage obtained from\\nsome new kind of induction coil? Could its transmission have been\\nimmeasurably increased by some unknown system of levers?** This was\\nthe point I couldn’t grasp.\\n\\n**Author’s Note: And sure enough, there’s now talk of such a\\n  discovery, in which a new set of levers generates considerable\\n  power. Did its inventor meet up with Captain Nemo?\\n\\n“Captain Nemo,” I said, “I’ll vouch for the results and not try to\\nexplain them. I’ve seen the Nautilus at work out in front of the\\nAbraham Lincoln, and I know where I stand on its speed. But it isn’t\\nenough just to move, we have to see where we’re going! We must be able\\nto steer right or left, up or down! How do you reach the lower depths,\\nwhere you meet an increasing resistance that’s assessed in hundreds of\\natmospheres? How do you rise back to the surface of the ocean?\\nFinally, how do you keep your ship at whatever level suits you? Am I\\nindiscreet in asking you all these things?”\\n\\n“Not at all, professor,” the captain answered me after a slight\\nhesitation, “since you’ll never leave this underwater boat. Come into\\nthe lounge. It’s actually our work room, and there you’ll learn the\\nfull story about the Nautilus!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nSome Figures\\n\\n\\nA MOMENT LATER we were seated on a couch in the lounge, cigars between\\nour lips. The captain placed before my eyes a working drawing that\\ngave the ground plan, cross section, and side view of the\\nNautilus. Then he began his description as follows:\\n\\n“Here, Professor Aronnax, are the different dimensions of this boat\\nnow transporting you. It’s a very long cylinder with conical ends. It\\nnoticeably takes the shape of a cigar, a shape already adopted in\\nLondon for several projects of the same kind. The length of this\\ncylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters, and its maximum\\nbreadth of beam is eight meters. So it isn’t quite built on the\\nten-to-one ratio of your high-speed steamers; but its lines are\\nsufficiently long, and their tapering gradual enough, so that the\\ndisplaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship’s\\nmovements.\\n\\n“These two dimensions allow you to obtain, via a simple calculation,\\nthe surface area and volume of the Nautilus. Its surface area totals\\n1,011.45 square meters, its volume 1,507.2 cubic meters—which is\\ntantamount to saying that when it’s completely submerged, it displaces\\n1,500 cubic meters of water, or weighs 1,500 metric tons.\\n\\n“In drawing up plans for a ship meant to navigate underwater, I wanted\\nit, when floating on the waves, to lie nine-tenths below the surface\\nand to emerge only one-tenth. Consequently, under these conditions it\\nneeded to displace only nine-tenths of its volume, hence 1,356.48\\ncubic meters; in other words, it was to weigh only that same number of\\nmetric tons. So I was obliged not to exceed this weight while building\\nit to the aforesaid dimensions.\\n\\n“The Nautilus is made up of two hulls, one inside the other; between\\nthem, joining them together, are iron T-bars that give this ship the\\nutmost rigidity. In fact, thanks to this cellular arrangement, it has\\nthe resistance of a stone block, as if it were completely solid. Its\\nplating can’t give way; it’s self-adhering and not dependent on the\\ntightness of its rivets; and due to the perfect union of its\\nmaterials, the solidarity of its construction allows it to defy the\\nmost violent seas.\\n\\n“The two hulls are manufactured from boilerplate steel, whose relative\\ndensity is 7.8 times that of water. The first hull has a thickness of\\nno less than five centimeters and weighs 394.96 metric tons. My second\\nhull, the outer cover, includes a keel fifty centimeters high by\\ntwenty-five wide, which by itself weighs 62 metric tons; this hull,\\nthe engine, the ballast, the various accessories and accommodations,\\nplus the bulkheads and interior braces, have a combined weight of\\n961.52 metric tons, which when added to 394.96 metric tons, gives us\\nthe desired total of 1,356.48 metric tons. Clear?”\\n\\n“Clear,” I replied.\\n\\n“So,” the captain went on, “when the Nautilus lies on the waves under\\nthese conditions, one-tenth of it does emerge above water. Now then,\\nif I provide some ballast tanks equal in capacity to that one-tenth,\\nhence able to hold 150.72 metric tons, and if I fill them with water,\\nthe boat then displaces 1,507.2 metric tons—or it weighs that much—and\\nit would be completely submerged. That’s what comes about,\\nprofessor. These ballast tanks exist within easy access in the lower\\nreaches of the Nautilus. I open some stopcocks, the tanks fill, the\\nboat sinks, and it’s exactly flush with the surface of the water.”\\n\\n“Fine, captain, but now we come to a genuine difficulty. You’re able\\nto lie flush with the surface of the ocean, that I understand. But\\nlower down, while diving beneath that surface, isn’t your submersible\\ngoing to encounter a pressure, and consequently undergo an upward\\nthrust, that must be assessed at one atmosphere per every thirty feet\\nof water, hence at about one kilogram per each square centimeter?”\\n\\n“Precisely, sir.”\\n\\n“Then unless you fill up the whole Nautilus, I don’t see how you can\\nforce it down into the heart of these liquid masses.”\\n\\n“Professor,” Captain Nemo replied, “static objects mustn’t be confused\\nwith dynamic ones, or we’ll be open to serious error. Comparatively\\nlittle effort is spent in reaching the ocean’s lower regions, because\\nall objects have a tendency to become ‘sinkers.’ Follow my logic\\nhere.”\\n\\n“I’m all ears, captain.”\\n\\n“When I wanted to determine what increase in weight the Nautilus\\nneeded to be given in order to submerge, I had only to take note of\\nthe proportionate reduction in volume that salt water experiences in\\ndeeper and deeper strata.”\\n\\n“That’s obvious,” I replied.\\n\\n“Now then, if water isn’t absolutely incompressible, at least it\\ncompresses very little. In fact, according to the most recent\\ncalculations, this reduction is only .0000436 per atmosphere, or per\\nevery thirty feet of depth. For instance, to go 1,000 meters down, I\\nmust take into account the reduction in volume that occurs under a\\npressure equivalent to that from a 1,000-meter column of water, in\\nother words, under a pressure of 100 atmospheres. In this instance the\\nreduction would be .00436. Consequently, I’d have to increase my\\nweight from 1,507.2 metric tons to 1,513.77. So the added weight would\\nonly be 6.57 metric tons.”\\n\\n“That’s all?”\\n\\n“That’s all, Professor Aronnax, and the calculation is easy to\\ncheck. Now then, I have supplementary ballast tanks capable of\\nshipping 100 metric tons of water. So I can descend to considerable\\ndepths. When I want to rise again and lie flush with the surface, all\\nI have to do is expel that water; and if I desire that the Nautilus\\nemerge above the waves to one-tenth of its total capacity, I empty all\\nthe ballast tanks completely.”\\n\\nThis logic, backed up by figures, left me without a single objection.\\n\\n“I accept your calculations, captain,” I replied, “and I’d be\\nill-mannered to dispute them, since your daily experience bears them\\nout. But at this juncture, I have a hunch that we’re still left with\\none real difficulty.”\\n\\n“What’s that, sir?”\\n\\n“When you’re at a depth of 1,000 meters, the Nautilus’s plating bears\\na pressure of 100 atmospheres. If at this point you want to empty the\\nsupplementary ballast tanks in order to lighten your boat and rise to\\nthe surface, your pumps must overcome that pressure of 100\\natmospheres, which is 100 kilograms per each square centimeter. This\\ndemands a strength—”\\n\\n“That electricity alone can give me,” Captain Nemo said swiftly. “Sir,\\nI repeat: the dynamic power of my engines is nearly infinite. The\\nNautilus’s pumps have prodigious strength, as you must have noticed\\nwhen their waterspouts swept like a torrent over the Abraham\\nLincoln. Besides, I use my supplementary ballast tanks only to reach\\nan average depth of 1,500 to 2,000 meters, and that with a view to\\nconserving my machinery. Accordingly, when I have a mind to visit the\\nocean depths two or three vertical leagues beneath the surface, I use\\nmaneuvers that are more time-consuming but no less infallible.”\\n\\n“What are they, captain?” I asked.\\n\\n“Here I’m naturally led into telling you how the Nautilus is\\nmaneuvered.”\\n\\n“I can’t wait to find out.”\\n\\n“In order to steer this boat to port or starboard, in short, to make\\nturns on a horizontal plane, I use an ordinary, wide-bladed rudder\\nthat’s fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and\\ntackle. But I can also move the Nautilus upward and downward on a\\nvertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins, which\\nare attached to its sides at its center of flotation; these fins are\\nflexible, able to assume any position, and can be operated from inside\\nby means of powerful levers. If these fins stay parallel with the\\nboat, the latter moves horizontally. If they slant, the Nautilus\\nfollows the angle of that slant and, under its propeller’s thrust,\\neither sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me, or rises on that\\ndiagonal. And similarly, if I want to return more swiftly to the\\nsurface, I throw the propeller in gear, and the water’s pressure makes\\nthe Nautilus rise vertically, as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen\\nlifts swiftly into the skies.”\\n\\n“Bravo, captain!” I exclaimed. “But in the midst of the waters, how\\ncan your helmsman follow the course you’ve given him?”\\n\\n“My helmsman is stationed behind the windows of a pilothouse, which\\nprotrudes from the topside of the Nautilus’s hull and is fitted with\\nbiconvex glass.”\\n\\n“Is glass capable of resisting such pressures?”\\n\\n“Perfectly capable. Though fragile on impact, crystal can still offer\\nconsiderable resistance. In 1864, during experiments on fishing by\\nelectric light in the middle of the North Sea, glass panes less than\\nseven millimeters thick were seen to resist a pressure of sixteen\\natmospheres, all the while letting through strong, heat-generating\\nrays whose warmth was unevenly distributed. Now then, I use glass\\nwindows measuring no less than twenty-one centimeters at their\\ncenters; in other words, they’ve thirty times the thickness.”\\n\\n“Fair enough, captain, but if we’re going to see, we need light to\\ndrive away the dark, and in the midst of the murky waters, I wonder\\nhow your helmsman can—”\\n\\n“Set astern of the pilothouse is a powerful electric reflector whose\\nrays light up the sea for a distance of half a mile.”\\n\\n“Oh, bravo! Bravo three times over, captain! That explains the\\nphosphorescent glow from this so-called narwhale that so puzzled us\\nscientists! Pertinent to this, I’ll ask you if the Nautilus’s running\\nafoul of the Scotia, which caused such a great uproar, was the result\\nof an accidental encounter?”\\n\\n“Entirely accidental, sir. I was navigating two meters beneath the\\nsurface of the water when the collision occurred. However, I could see\\nthat it had no dire consequences.”\\n\\n“None, sir. But as for your encounter with the Abraham Lincoln\\n. . . ?”\\n\\n“Professor, that troubled me, because it’s one of the best ships in\\nthe gallant American navy, but they attacked me and I had to defend\\nmyself! All the same, I was content simply to put the frigate in a\\ncondition where it could do me no harm; it won’t have any difficulty\\ngetting repairs at the nearest port.”\\n\\n“Ah, commander,” I exclaimed with conviction, “your Nautilus is truly\\na marvelous boat!”\\n\\n“Yes, professor,” Captain Nemo replied with genuine excitement, “and I\\nlove it as if it were my own flesh and blood! Aboard a conventional\\nship, facing the ocean’s perils, danger lurks everywhere; on the\\nsurface of the sea, your chief sensation is the constant feeling of an\\nunderlying chasm, as the Dutchman Jansen so aptly put it; but below\\nthe waves aboard the Nautilus, your heart never fails you! There are\\nno structural deformities to worry about, because the double hull of\\nthis boat has the rigidity of iron; no rigging to be worn out by\\nrolling and pitching on the waves; no sails for the wind to carry off;\\nno boilers for steam to burst open; no fires to fear, because this\\nsubmersible is made of sheet iron not wood; no coal to run out of,\\nsince electricity is its mechanical force; no collisions to fear,\\nbecause it navigates the watery deep all by itself; no storms to\\nbrave, because just a few meters beneath the waves, it finds absolute\\ntranquility! There, sir. There’s the ideal ship! And if it’s true that\\nthe engineer has more confidence in a craft than the builder, and the\\nbuilder more than the captain himself, you can understand the utter\\nabandon with which I place my trust in this Nautilus, since I’m its\\ncaptain, builder, and engineer all in one!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo spoke with winning eloquence. The fire in his eyes and\\nthe passion in his gestures transfigured him. Yes, he loved his ship\\nthe same way a father loves his child!\\n\\nBut one question, perhaps indiscreet, naturally popped up, and I\\ncouldn’t resist asking it.\\n\\n“You’re an engineer, then, Captain Nemo?”\\n\\n“Yes, professor,” he answered me. “I studied in London, Paris, and New\\nYork back in the days when I was a resident of the earth’s\\ncontinents.”\\n\\n“But how were you able to build this wonderful Nautilus in secret?”\\n\\n“Each part of it, Professor Aronnax, came from a different spot on the\\nglobe and reached me at a cover address. Its keel was forged by\\nCreusot in France, its propeller shaft by Pen & Co. in London, the\\nsheet-iron plates for its hull by Laird’s in Liverpool, its propeller\\nby Scott’s in Glasgow. Its tanks were manufactured by Cail & Co. in\\nParis, its engine by Krupp in Prussia, its spur by the Motala\\nworkshops in Sweden, its precision instruments by Hart Bros. in New\\nYork, etc.; and each of these suppliers received my specifications\\nunder a different name.”\\n\\n“But,” I went on, “once these parts were manufactured, didn’t they\\nhave to be mounted and adjusted?”\\n\\n“Professor, I set up my workshops on a deserted islet in\\nmidocean. There our Nautilus was completed by me and my workmen, in\\nother words, by my gallant companions whom I’ve molded and\\neducated. Then, when the operation was over, we burned every trace of\\nour stay on that islet, which if I could have, I’d have blown up.”\\n\\n“From all this, may I assume that such a boat costs a fortune?”\\n\\n“An iron ship, Professor Aronnax, runs 1,125 francs per metric\\nton. Now then, the Nautilus has a burden of 1,500 metric\\ntons. Consequently, it cost 1,687,000 francs, hence 2,000,000 francs\\nincluding its accommodations, and 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 with all the\\ncollections and works of art it contains.”\\n\\n“One last question, Captain Nemo.”\\n\\n“Ask, professor.”\\n\\n“You’re rich, then?”\\n\\n“Infinitely rich, sir, and without any trouble, I could pay off the\\nten-billion-franc French national debt!”\\n\\nI gaped at the bizarre individual who had just spoken these words. Was\\nhe playing on my credulity? Time would tell.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nThe Black Current\\n\\n\\nTHE PART OF THE planet earth that the seas occupy has been assessed at\\n3,832,558 square myriameters, hence more than 38,000,000,000\\nhectares. This liquid mass totals 2,250,000,000 cubic miles and could\\nform a sphere with a diameter of sixty leagues, whose weight would be\\nthree quintillion metric tons. To appreciate such a number, we should\\nremember that a quintillion is to a billion what a billion is to one,\\nin other words, there are as many billions in a quintillion as ones in\\na billion! Now then, this liquid mass nearly equals the total amount\\nof water that has poured through all the earth’s rivers for the past\\n40,000 years!\\n\\nDuring prehistoric times, an era of fire was followed by an era of\\nwater. At first there was ocean everywhere. Then, during the Silurian\\nperiod, the tops of mountains gradually appeared above the waves,\\nislands emerged, disappeared beneath temporary floods, rose again,\\nwere fused to form continents, and finally the earth’s geography\\nsettled into what we have today. Solid matter had wrested from liquid\\nmatter some 37,657,000 square miles, hence 12,916,000,000 hectares.\\n\\nThe outlines of the continents allow the seas to be divided into five\\nmajor parts: the frozen Arctic and Antarctic oceans, the Indian Ocean,\\nthe Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nThe Pacific Ocean extends north to south between the two polar circles\\nand east to west between America and Asia over an expanse of 145\\ndegrees of longitude. It’s the most tranquil of the seas; its currents\\nare wide and slow-moving, its tides moderate, its rainfall\\nabundant. And this was the ocean that I was first destined to cross\\nunder these strangest of auspices.\\n\\n“If you don’t mind, professor,” Captain Nemo told me, “we’ll determine\\nour exact position and fix the starting point of our voyage. It’s\\nfifteen minutes before noon. I’m going to rise to the surface of the\\nwater.”\\n\\nThe captain pressed an electric bell three times. The pumps began to\\nexpel water from the ballast tanks; on the pressure gauge, a needle\\nmarked the decreasing pressures that indicated the Nautilus’s upward\\nprogress; then the needle stopped.\\n\\n“Here we are,” the captain said.\\n\\nI made my way to the central companionway, which led to the\\nplatform. I climbed its metal steps, passed through the open hatches,\\nand arrived topside on the Nautilus.\\n\\nThe platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves. The\\nNautilus’s bow and stern boasted that spindle-shaped outline that had\\ncaused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar. I noted\\nthe slight overlap of its sheet-iron plates, which resembled the\\nscales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles. So I had a\\nperfectly natural explanation for why, despite the best spyglasses,\\nthis boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal.\\n\\nNear the middle of the platform, the skiff was half set in the ship’s\\nhull, making a slight bulge. Fore and aft stood two cupolas of\\nmoderate height, their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy\\nbiconvex glass, one reserved for the helmsman steering the Nautilus,\\nthe other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting\\nhis way.\\n\\nThe sea was magnificent, the skies clear. This long aquatic vehicle\\ncould barely feel the broad undulations of the ocean. A mild breeze\\nout of the east rippled the surface of the water. Free of all mist,\\nthe horizon was ideal for taking sights.\\n\\nThere was nothing to be seen. Not a reef, not an islet. No more\\nAbraham Lincoln. A deserted immenseness.\\n\\nRaising his sextant, Captain Nemo took the altitude of the sun, which\\nwould give him his latitude. He waited for a few minutes until the orb\\ntouched the rim of the horizon. While he was taking his sights, he\\ndidn’t move a muscle, and the instrument couldn’t have been steadier\\nin hands made out of marble.\\n\\n“Noon,” he said. “Professor, whenever you’re ready. . . .”\\n\\nI took one last look at the sea, a little yellowish near the landing\\nplaces of Japan, and I went below again to the main lounge.\\n\\nThere the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer to\\ncalculate his longitude, which he double-checked against his previous\\nobservations of hour angles. Then he told me:\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax, we’re in longitude 137 degrees 15’ west—”\\n\\n“West of which meridian?” I asked quickly, hoping the captain’s reply\\nmight give me a clue to his nationality.\\n\\n“Sir,” he answered me, “I have chronometers variously set to the\\nmeridians of Paris, Greenwich, and Washington, D.C. But in your honor,\\nI’ll use the one for Paris.”\\n\\nThis reply told me nothing. I bowed, and the commander went on:\\n\\n“We’re in longitude 137 degrees 15’ west of the meridian of Paris, and\\nlatitude 30 degrees 7’ north, in other words, about 300 miles from the\\nshores of Japan. At noon on this day of November 8, we hereby begin\\nour voyage of exploration under the waters.”\\n\\n“May God be with us!” I replied.\\n\\n“And now, professor,” the captain added, “I’ll leave you to your\\nintellectual pursuits. I’ve set our course east-northeast at a depth\\nof fifty meters. Here are some large-scale charts on which you’ll be\\nable to follow that course. The lounge is at your disposal, and with\\nyour permission, I’ll take my leave.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo bowed. I was left to myself, lost in my thoughts. They\\nall centered on the Nautilus’s commander. Would I ever learn the\\nnationality of this eccentric man who had boasted of having none? His\\nsworn hate for humanity, a hate that perhaps was bent on some dreadful\\nrevenge—what had provoked it? Was he one of those unappreciated\\nscholars, one of those geniuses “embittered by the world,” as Conseil\\nexpressed it, a latter-day Galileo, or maybe one of those men of\\nscience, like America’s Commander Maury, whose careers were ruined by\\npolitical revolutions? I couldn’t say yet. As for me, whom fate had\\njust brought aboard his vessel, whose life he had held in the balance:\\nhe had received me coolly but hospitably. Only, he never took the hand\\nI extended to him. He never extended his own.\\n\\nFor an entire hour I was deep in these musings, trying to probe this\\nmystery that fascinated me so. Then my eyes focused on a huge world\\nmap displayed on the table, and I put my finger on the very spot where\\nour just-determined longitude and latitude intersected.\\n\\nLike the continents, the sea has its rivers. These are exclusive\\ncurrents that can be identified by their temperature and color, the\\nmost remarkable being the one called the Gulf Stream. Science has\\ndefined the global paths of five chief currents: one in the north\\nAtlantic, a second in the south Atlantic, a third in the north\\nPacific, a fourth in the south Pacific, and a fifth in the southern\\nIndian Ocean. Also it’s likely that a sixth current used to exist in\\nthe northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas joined up\\nwith certain large Asian lakes to form a single uniform expanse of\\nwater.\\n\\nNow then, at the spot indicated on the world map, one of these\\nseagoing rivers was rolling by, the Kuroshio of the Japanese, the\\nBlack Current: heated by perpendicular rays from the tropical sun, it\\nleaves the Bay of Bengal, crosses the Strait of Malacca, goes up the\\nshores of Asia, and curves into the north Pacific as far as the\\nAleutian Islands, carrying along trunks of camphor trees and other\\nlocal items, the pure indigo of its warm waters sharply contrasting\\nwith the ocean’s waves. It was this current the Nautilus was about to\\ncross. I watched it on the map with my eyes, I saw it lose itself in\\nthe immenseness of the Pacific, and I felt myself swept along with it,\\nwhen Ned Land and Conseil appeared in the lounge doorway.\\n\\nMy two gallant companions stood petrified at the sight of the wonders\\non display.\\n\\n“Where are we?” the Canadian exclaimed. “In the Quebec Museum?”\\n\\n“Begging master’s pardon,” Conseil answered, “but this seems more like\\nthe Sommerard artifacts exhibition!”\\n\\n“My friends,” I replied, signaling them to enter, “you’re in neither\\nCanada nor France, but securely aboard the Nautilus, fifty meters\\nbelow sea level.”\\n\\n“If master says so, then so be it,” Conseil answered. “But in all\\nhonesty, this lounge is enough to astonish even someone Flemish like\\nmyself.”\\n\\n“Indulge your astonishment, my friend, and have a look, because\\nthere’s plenty of work here for a classifier of your talents.”\\n\\nConseil needed no encouraging. Bending over the glass cases, the\\ngallant lad was already muttering choice words from the naturalist’s\\nvocabulary: class Gastropoda, family Buccinoidea, genus cowry, species\\nCypraea madagascariensis, etc.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ned Land, less dedicated to conchology, questioned me about\\nmy interview with Captain Nemo. Had I discovered who he was, where he\\ncame from, where he was heading, how deep he was taking us? In short,\\na thousand questions I had no time to answer.\\n\\nI told him everything I knew—or, rather, everything I didn’t know—and\\nI asked him what he had seen or heard on his part.\\n\\n“Haven’t seen or heard a thing!” the Canadian replied. “I haven’t even\\nspotted the crew of this boat. By any chance, could they be electric\\ntoo?”\\n\\n“Electric?”\\n\\n“Oh ye gods, I’m half tempted to believe it! But back to you,\\nProfessor Aronnax,” Ned Land said, still hanging on to his\\nideas. “Can’t you tell me how many men are on board? Ten, twenty,\\nfifty, a hundred?”\\n\\n“I’m unable to answer you, Mr. Land. And trust me on this: for the\\ntime being, get rid of these notions of taking over the Nautilus or\\nescaping from it. This boat is a masterpiece of modern technology, and\\nI’d be sorry to have missed it! Many people would welcome the\\ncircumstances that have been handed us, just to walk in the midst of\\nthese wonders. So keep calm, and let’s see what’s happening around\\nus.”\\n\\n“See!” the harpooner exclaimed. “There’s nothing to see, nothing we’ll\\never see from this sheet-iron prison! We’re simply running around\\nblindfolded—”\\n\\nNed Land was just pronouncing these last words when we were suddenly\\nplunged into darkness, utter darkness. The ceiling lights went out so\\nquickly, my eyes literally ached, just as if we had experienced the\\nopposite sensation of going from the deepest gloom to the brightest\\nsunlight.\\n\\nWe stood stock-still, not knowing what surprise was waiting for us,\\nwhether pleasant or unpleasant. But a sliding sound became\\naudible. You could tell that some panels were shifting over the\\nNautilus’s sides.\\n\\n“It’s the beginning of the end!” Ned Land said.\\n\\n“. . . order Hydromedusa,” Conseil muttered.\\n\\nSuddenly, through two oblong openings, daylight appeared on both sides\\nof the lounge. The liquid masses came into view, brightly lit by the\\nship’s electric outpourings. We were separated from the sea by two\\npanes of glass. Initially I shuddered at the thought that these\\nfragile partitions could break; but strong copper bands secured them,\\ngiving them nearly infinite resistance.\\n\\nThe sea was clearly visible for a one-mile radius around the\\nNautilus. What a sight! What pen could describe it? Who could portray\\nthe effects of this light through these translucent sheets of water,\\nthe subtlety of its progressive shadings into the ocean’s upper and\\nlower strata?\\n\\nThe transparency of salt water has long been recognized. Its clarity\\nis believed to exceed that of spring water. The mineral and organic\\nsubstances it holds in suspension actually increase its\\ntranslucency. In certain parts of the Caribbean Sea, you can see the\\nsandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down,\\nand the penetrating power of the sun’s rays seems to give out only at\\na depth of 300 meters. But in this fluid setting traveled by the\\nNautilus, our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of\\nthe waves. It was no longer illuminated water, it was liquid light.\\n\\nIf we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist Ehrenberg—who\\nbelieves that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent\\norganisms—nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights\\nfor residents of the sea, and I could judge for myself from the\\nthousandfold play of the light. On both sides I had windows opening\\nover these unexplored depths. The darkness in the lounge enhanced the\\nbrightness outside, and we stared as if this clear glass were the\\nwindow of an immense aquarium.\\n\\nThe Nautilus seemed to be standing still. This was due to the lack of\\nlandmarks. But streaks of water, parted by the ship’s spur, sometimes\\nthreaded before our eyes with extraordinary speed.\\n\\nIn wonderment, we leaned on our elbows before these show windows, and\\nour stunned silence remained unbroken until Conseil said:\\n\\n“You wanted to see something, Ned my friend; well, now you have\\nsomething to see!”\\n\\n“How unusual!” the Canadian put in, setting aside his tantrums and\\ngetaway schemes while submitting to this irresistible allure. “A man\\nwould go an even greater distance just to stare at such a sight!”\\n\\n“Ah!” I exclaimed. “I see our captain’s way of life! He’s found\\nhimself a separate world that saves its most astonishing wonders just\\nfor him!”\\n\\n“But where are the fish?” the Canadian ventured to observe. “I don’t\\nsee any fish!”\\n\\n“Why would you care, Ned my friend?” Conseil replied. “Since you have\\nno knowledge of them.”\\n\\n“Me? A fisherman!” Ned Land exclaimed.\\n\\nAnd on this subject a dispute arose between the two friends, since\\nboth were knowledgeable about fish, but from totally different\\nstandpoints.\\n\\nEveryone knows that fish make up the fourth and last class in the\\nvertebrate branch. They have been quite aptly defined as:\\n“cold-blooded vertebrates with a double circulatory system, breathing\\nthrough gills, and designed to live in water.” They consist of two\\ndistinct series: the series of bony fish, in other words, those whose\\nspines have vertebrae made of bone; and cartilaginous fish, in other\\nwords, those whose spines have vertebrae made of cartilage.\\n\\nPossibly the Canadian was familiar with this distinction, but Conseil\\nknew far more about it; and since he and Ned were now fast friends, he\\njust had to show off. So he told the harpooner:\\n\\n“Ned my friend, you’re a slayer of fish, a highly skilled\\nfisherman. You’ve caught a large number of these fascinating\\nanimals. But I’ll bet you don’t know how they’re classified.”\\n\\n“Sure I do,” the harpooner replied in all seriousness. “They’re\\nclassified into fish we eat and fish we don’t eat!”\\n\\n“Spoken like a true glutton,” Conseil replied. “But tell me, are you\\nfamiliar with the differences between bony fish and cartilaginous\\nfish?”\\n\\n“Just maybe, Conseil.”\\n\\n“And how about the subdivisions of these two large classes?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the foggiest notion,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“All right, listen and learn, Ned my friend! Bony fish are subdivided\\ninto six orders. Primo, the acanthopterygians, whose upper jaw is\\nfully formed and free-moving, and whose gills take the shape of a\\ncomb. This order consists of fifteen families, in other words,\\nthree-quarters of all known fish. Example: the common perch.”\\n\\n“Pretty fair eating,” Ned Land replied.\\n\\n“Secundo,” Conseil went on, “the abdominals, whose pelvic fins hang\\nunder the abdomen to the rear of the pectorals but aren’t attached to\\nthe shoulder bone, an order that’s divided into five families and\\nmakes up the great majority of freshwater fish. Examples: carp, pike.”\\n\\n“Ugh!” the Canadian put in with distinct scorn. “You can keep the\\nfreshwater fish!”\\n\\n“Tertio,” Conseil said, “the subbrachians, whose pelvic fins are\\nattached under the pectorals and hang directly from the shoulder\\nbone. This order contains four families. Examples: flatfish such as\\nsole, turbot, dab, plaice, brill, etc.”\\n\\n“Excellent, really excellent!” the harpooner exclaimed, interested in\\nfish only from an edible viewpoint.\\n\\n“Quarto,” Conseil went on, unabashed, “the apods, with long bodies\\nthat lack pelvic fins and are covered by a heavy, often glutinous\\nskin, an order consisting of only one family. Examples: common eels\\nand electric eels.”\\n\\n“So-so, just so-so!” Ned Land replied.\\n\\n“Quinto,” Conseil said, “the lophobranchians, which have fully formed,\\nfree-moving jaws but whose gills consist of little tufts arranged in\\npairs along their gill arches. This order includes only one\\nfamily. Examples: seahorses and dragonfish.”\\n\\n“Bad, very bad!” the harpooner replied.\\n\\n“Sexto and last,” Conseil said, “the plectognaths, whose maxillary\\nbone is firmly attached to the side of the intermaxillary that forms\\nthe jaw, and whose palate arch is locked to the skull by sutures that\\nrender the jaw immovable, an order lacking true pelvic fins and which\\nconsists of two families. Examples: puffers and moonfish.”\\n\\n“They’re an insult to a frying pan!” the Canadian exclaimed.\\n\\n“Are you grasping all this, Ned my friend?” asked the scholarly\\nConseil.\\n\\n“Not a lick of it, Conseil my friend,” the harpooner replied. “But\\nkeep going, because you fill me with fascination.”\\n\\n“As for cartilaginous fish,” Conseil went on unflappably, “they\\nconsist of only three orders.”\\n\\n“Good news,” Ned put in.\\n\\n“Primo, the cyclostomes, whose jaws are fused into a flexible ring and\\nwhose gill openings are simply a large number of holes, an order\\nconsisting of only one family. Example: the lamprey.”\\n\\n“An acquired taste,” Ned Land replied.\\n\\n“Secundo, the selacians, with gills resembling those of the\\ncyclostomes but whose lower jaw is free-moving. This order, which is\\nthe most important in the class, consists of two families. Examples:\\nthe ray and the shark.”\\n\\n“What!” Ned Land exclaimed. “Rays and man-eaters in the same order?\\nWell, Conseil my friend, on behalf of the rays, I wouldn’t advise you\\nto put them in the same fish tank!”\\n\\n“Tertio,” Conseil replied, “The sturionians, whose gill opening is the\\nusual single slit adorned with a gill cover, an order consisting of\\nfour genera. Example: the sturgeon.”\\n\\n“Ah, Conseil my friend, you saved the best for last, in my opinion\\nanyhow! And that’s all of ‘em?”\\n\\n“Yes, my gallant Ned,” Conseil replied. “And note well, even when one\\nhas grasped all this, one still knows next to nothing, because these\\nfamilies are subdivided into genera, subgenera, species, varieties—”\\n\\n“All right, Conseil my friend,” the harpooner said, leaning toward the\\nglass panel, “here come a couple of your varieties now!”\\n\\n“Yes! Fish!” Conseil exclaimed. “One would think he was in front of an\\naquarium!”\\n\\n“No,” I replied, “because an aquarium is nothing more than a cage, and\\nthese fish are as free as birds in the air!”\\n\\n“Well, Conseil my friend, identify them! Start naming them!” Ned Land\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n“Me?” Conseil replied. “I’m unable to! That’s my employer’s\\nbailiwick!”\\n\\nAnd in truth, although the fine lad was a classifying maniac, he was\\nno naturalist, and I doubt that he could tell a bonito from a tuna. In\\nshort, he was the exact opposite of the Canadian, who knew nothing\\nabout classification but could instantly put a name to any fish.\\n\\n“A triggerfish,” I said.\\n\\n“It’s a Chinese triggerfish,” Ned Land replied.\\n\\n“Genus Balistes, family Scleroderma, order Plectognatha,” Conseil\\nmuttered.\\n\\nAssuredly, Ned and Conseil in combination added up to one outstanding\\nnaturalist.\\n\\nThe Canadian was not mistaken. Cavorting around the Nautilus was a\\nschool of triggerfish with flat bodies, grainy skins, armed with\\nstings on their dorsal fins, and with four prickly rows of quills\\nquivering on both sides of their tails. Nothing could have been more\\nwonderful than the skin covering them: white underneath, gray above,\\nwith spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves. Around\\nthem, rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind, and among\\nthese I spotted, much to my glee, a Chinese ray, yellowish on its\\ntopside, a dainty pink on its belly, and armed with three stings\\nbehind its eyes; a rare species whose very existence was still doubted\\nin Lacépède’s day, since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen\\none only in a portfolio of Japanese drawings.\\n\\nFor two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the Nautilus. In the midst\\nof their leaping and cavorting, while they competed with each other in\\nbeauty, radiance, and speed, I could distinguish some green wrasse,\\nbewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines, white gobies from\\nthe genus Eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the\\nback, wonderful Japanese mackerel from the genus Scomber with blue\\nbodies and silver heads, glittering azure goldfish whose name by\\nitself gives their full description, several varieties of porgy or\\ngilthead (some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow,\\nsome with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip\\naround their caudal area, some with color zones and elegantly corseted\\nin their six waistbands), trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked\\nlike genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long,\\nJapanese salamanders, serpentine moray eels from the genus Echidna\\nthat were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth\\nbristling with teeth; etc.\\n\\nOur wonderment stayed at an all-time fever pitch. Our exclamations\\nwere endless. Ned identified the fish, Conseil classified them, and as\\nfor me, I was in ecstasy over the verve of their movements and the\\nbeauty of their forms. Never before had I been given the chance to\\nglimpse these animals alive and at large in their native element.\\n\\nGiven such a complete collection from the seas of Japan and China, I\\nwon’t mention every variety that passed before our dazzled eyes. More\\nnumerous than birds in the air, these fish raced right up to us, no\\ndoubt attracted by the brilliant glow of our electric beacon.\\n\\nSuddenly daylight appeared in the lounge. The sheet-iron panels slid\\nshut. The magical vision disappeared. But for a good while I kept\\ndreaming away, until the moment my eyes focused on the instruments\\nhanging on the wall. The compass still showed our heading as\\neast-northeast, the pressure gauge indicated a pressure of five\\natmospheres (corresponding to a depth of fifty meters), and the\\nelectric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour.\\n\\nI waited for Captain Nemo. But he didn’t appear. The clock marked the\\nhour of five.\\n\\nNed Land and Conseil returned to their cabin. As for me, I repaired to\\nmy stateroom. There I found dinner ready for me. It consisted of\\nturtle soup made from the daintiest hawksbill, a red mullet with\\nwhite, slightly flaky flesh, whose liver, when separately prepared,\\nmakes delicious eating, plus loin of imperial angelfish, whose flavor\\nstruck me as even better than salmon.\\n\\nI spent the evening in reading, writing, and thinking. Then drowsiness\\novertook me, I stretched out on my eelgrass mattress, and I fell into\\na deep slumber, while the Nautilus glided through the swiftly flowing\\nBlack Current.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\nAn Invitation in Writing\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY, November 9, I woke up only after a long, twelve-hour\\nslumber. Conseil, a creature of habit, came to ask “how master’s night\\nwent,” and to offer his services. He had left his Canadian friend\\nsleeping like a man who had never done anything else.\\n\\nI let the gallant lad babble as he pleased, without giving him much in\\nthe way of a reply. I was concerned about Captain Nemo’s absence\\nduring our session the previous afternoon, and I hoped to see him\\nagain today.\\n\\nSoon I had put on my clothes, which were woven from strands of\\nseashell tissue. More than once their composition provoked comments\\nfrom Conseil. I informed him that they were made from the smooth,\\nsilken filaments with which the fan mussel, a type of seashell quite\\nabundant along Mediterranean beaches, attaches itself to rocks. In\\nolden times, fine fabrics, stockings, and gloves were made from such\\nfilaments, because they were both very soft and very warm. So the\\nNautilus’s crew could dress themselves at little cost, without needing\\na thing from cotton growers, sheep, or silkworms on shore.\\n\\nAs soon as I was dressed, I made my way to the main lounge. It was\\ndeserted.\\n\\nI dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the\\nglass cases. I also investigated the huge plant albums that were\\nfilled with the rarest marine herbs, which, although they were pressed\\nand dried, still kept their wonderful colors. Among these valuable\\nwater plants, I noted various seaweed: some Cladostephus\\nverticillatus, peacock’s tails, fig-leafed caulerpa, grain-bearing\\nbeauty bushes, delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet, sea colander\\narranged into fan shapes, mermaid’s cups that looked like the caps of\\nsquat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes;\\nin short, a complete series of algae.\\n\\nThe entire day passed without my being honored by a visit from Captain\\nNemo. The panels in the lounge didn’t open. Perhaps they didn’t want\\nus to get tired of these beautiful things.\\n\\nThe Nautilus kept to an east-northeasterly heading, a speed of twelve\\nmiles per hour, and a depth between fifty and sixty meters.\\n\\nNext day, November 10: the same neglect, the same solitude. I didn’t\\nsee a soul from the crew. Ned and Conseil spent the better part of the\\nday with me. They were astonished at the captain’s inexplicable\\nabsence. Was this eccentric man ill? Did he want to change his plans\\nconcerning us?\\n\\nBut after all, as Conseil noted, we enjoyed complete freedom, we were\\ndaintily and abundantly fed. Our host had kept to the terms of his\\nagreement. We couldn’t complain, and moreover the very uniqueness of\\nour situation had such generous rewards in store for us, we had no\\ngrounds for criticism.\\n\\nThat day I started my diary of these adventures, which has enabled me\\nto narrate them with the most scrupulous accuracy; and one odd detail:\\nI wrote it on paper manufactured from marine eelgrass.\\n\\nEarly in the morning on November 11, fresh air poured through the\\nNautilus’s interior, informing me that we had returned to the surface\\nof the ocean to renew our oxygen supply. I headed for the central\\ncompanionway and climbed onto the platform.\\n\\nIt was six o’clock. I found the weather overcast, the sea gray but\\ncalm. Hardly a billow. I hoped to encounter Captain Nemo there—would\\nhe come? I saw only the helmsman imprisoned in his glass-windowed\\npilothouse. Seated on the ledge furnished by the hull of the skiff, I\\ninhaled the sea’s salty aroma with great pleasure.\\n\\nLittle by little, the mists were dispersed under the action of the\\nsun’s rays. The radiant orb cleared the eastern horizon. Under its\\ngaze, the sea caught on fire like a trail of gunpowder. Scattered on\\nhigh, the clouds were colored in bright, wonderfully shaded hues, and\\nnumerous “ladyfingers” warned of daylong winds.*\\n\\n*Author’s Note: “Ladyfingers” are small, thin, white clouds with\\n ragged edges.\\n\\nBut what were mere winds to this Nautilus, which no storms could\\nintimidate!\\n\\nSo I was marveling at this delightful sunrise, so life-giving and\\ncheerful, when I heard someone climbing onto the platform.\\n\\nI was prepared to greet Captain Nemo, but it was his chief officer who\\nappeared—whom I had already met during our first visit with the\\ncaptain. He advanced over the platform, not seeming to notice my\\npresence. A powerful spyglass to his eye, he scrutinized every point\\nof the horizon with the utmost care. Then, his examination over, he\\napproached the hatch and pronounced a phrase whose exact wording\\nfollows below. I remember it because, every morning, it was repeated\\nunder the same circumstances. It ran like this:\\n\\n“Nautron respoc lorni virch.”\\n\\nWhat it meant I was unable to say.\\n\\nThese words pronounced, the chief officer went below again. I thought\\nthe Nautilus was about to resume its underwater navigating. So I went\\ndown the hatch and back through the gangways to my stateroom.\\n\\nFive days passed in this way with no change in our situation. Every\\nmorning I climbed onto the platform. The same phrase was pronounced by\\nthe same individual. Captain Nemo did not appear.\\n\\nI was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him, when on\\nNovember 16, while reentering my stateroom with Ned and Conseil, I\\nfound a note addressed to me on the table.\\n\\nI opened it impatiently. It was written in a script that was clear and\\nneat but a bit “Old English” in style, its characters reminding me of\\nGerman calligraphy.\\n\\nThe note was worded as follows:\\n\\n  Professor Aronnax\\n  Aboard the Nautilus\\n  November 16, 1867\\n\\n  Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax on a hunting trip that will\\n  take place tomorrow morning in his Crespo Island forests. He hopes\\n  nothing will prevent the professor from attending, and he looks\\n  forward with pleasure to the professor’s companions joining him.\\n\\n  CAPTAIN NEMO,\\n  Commander of the Nautilus.\\n\\n“A hunting trip!” Ned exclaimed.\\n\\n“And in his forests on Crespo Island!” Conseil added.\\n\\n“But does this mean the old boy goes ashore?” Ned Land went on.\\n\\n“That seems to be the gist of it,” I said, rereading the letter.\\n\\n“Well, we’ve got to accept!” the Canadian answered. “Once we’re on\\nsolid ground, we’ll figure out a course of action. Besides, it\\nwouldn’t pain me to eat a couple slices of fresh venison!”\\n\\nWithout trying to reconcile the contradictions between Captain Nemo’s\\nprofessed horror of continents or islands and his invitation to go\\nhunting in a forest, I was content to reply:\\n\\n“First let’s look into this Crespo Island.”\\n\\nI consulted the world map; and in latitude 32 degrees 40’ north and\\nlongitude 167 degrees 50’ west, I found an islet that had been\\ndiscovered in 1801 by Captain Crespo, which old Spanish charts called\\nRocca de la Plata, in other words, “Silver Rock.” So we were about\\n1,800 miles from our starting point, and by a slight change of\\nheading, the Nautilus was bringing us back toward the southeast.\\n\\nI showed my companions this small, stray rock in the middle of the\\nnorth Pacific.\\n\\n“If Captain Nemo does sometimes go ashore,” I told them, “at least he\\nonly picks desert islands!”\\n\\nNed Land shook his head without replying; then he and Conseil left\\nme. After supper was served me by the mute and emotionless steward, I\\nfell asleep; but not without some anxieties.\\n\\nWhen I woke up the next day, November 17, I sensed that the Nautilus\\nwas completely motionless. I dressed hurriedly and entered the main\\nlounge.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was there waiting for me. He stood up, bowed, and asked\\nif it suited me to come along.\\n\\nSince he made no allusion to his absence the past eight days, I also\\nrefrained from mentioning it, and I simply answered that my companions\\nand I were ready to go with him.\\n\\n“Only, sir,” I added, “I’ll take the liberty of addressing a question\\nto you.”\\n\\n“Address away, Professor Aronnax, and if I’m able to answer, I will.”\\n\\n“Well then, captain, how is it that you’ve severed all ties with the\\nshore, yet you own forests on Crespo Island?”\\n\\n“Professor,” the captain answered me, “these forests of mine don’t\\nbask in the heat and light of the sun. They aren’t frequented by\\nlions, tigers, panthers, or other quadrupeds. They’re known only to\\nme. They grow only for me. These forests aren’t on land, they’re\\nactual underwater forests.”\\n\\n“Underwater forests!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, professor.”\\n\\n“And you’re offering to take me to them?”\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“On foot?”\\n\\n“Without getting your feet wet.”\\n\\n“While hunting?”\\n\\n“While hunting.”\\n\\n“Rifles in hand?”\\n\\n“Rifles in hand.”\\n\\nI stared at the Nautilus’s commander with an air anything but\\nflattering to the man.\\n\\n“Assuredly,” I said to myself, “he’s contracted some mental\\nillness. He’s had a fit that’s lasted eight days and isn’t over even\\nyet. What a shame! I liked him better eccentric than insane!”\\n\\nThese thoughts were clearly readable on my face; but Captain Nemo\\nremained content with inviting me to follow him, and I did so like a\\nman resigned to the worst.\\n\\nWe arrived at the dining room, where we found breakfast served.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” the captain told me, “I beg you to share my\\nbreakfast without formality. We can chat while we eat. Because,\\nalthough I promised you a stroll in my forests, I made no pledge to\\narrange for your encountering a restaurant there. Accordingly, eat\\nyour breakfast like a man who’ll probably eat dinner only when it’s\\nextremely late.”\\n\\nI did justice to this meal. It was made up of various fish and some\\nslices of sea cucumber, that praiseworthy zoophyte, all garnished with\\nsuch highly appetizing seaweed as the Porphyra laciniata and the\\nLaurencia primafetida. Our beverage consisted of clear water to which,\\nfollowing the captain’s example, I added some drops of a fermented\\nliquor extracted by the Kamchatka process from the seaweed known by\\nname as Rhodymenia palmata.\\n\\nAt first Captain Nemo ate without pronouncing a single word. Then he\\ntold me:\\n\\n“Professor, when I proposed that you go hunting in my Crespo forests,\\nyou thought I was contradicting myself. When I informed you that it\\nwas an issue of underwater forests, you thought I’d gone\\ninsane. Professor, you must never make snap judgments about your\\nfellow man.”\\n\\n“But, captain, believe me—”\\n\\n“Kindly listen to me, and you’ll see if you have grounds for accusing\\nme of insanity or self-contradiction.”\\n\\n“I’m all attention.”\\n\\n“Professor, you know as well as I do that a man can live underwater so\\nlong as he carries with him his own supply of breathable air. For\\nunderwater work projects, the workman wears a waterproof suit with his\\nhead imprisoned in a metal capsule, while he receives air from above\\nby means of force pumps and flow regulators.”\\n\\n“That’s the standard equipment for a diving suit,” I said.\\n\\n“Correct, but under such conditions the man has no freedom. He’s\\nattached to a pump that sends him air through an india-rubber hose;\\nit’s an actual chain that fetters him to the shore, and if we were to\\nbe bound in this way to the Nautilus, we couldn’t go far either.”\\n\\n“Then how do you break free?” I asked.\\n\\n“We use the Rouquayrol-Denayrouze device, invented by two of your\\nfellow countrymen but refined by me for my own special uses, thereby\\nenabling you to risk these new physiological conditions without\\nsuffering any organic disorders. It consists of a tank built from\\nheavy sheet iron in which I store air under a pressure of fifty\\natmospheres. This tank is fastened to the back by means of straps,\\nlike a soldier’s knapsack. Its top part forms a box where the air is\\nregulated by a bellows mechanism and can be released only at its\\nproper tension. In the Rouquayrol device that has been in general use,\\ntwo india-rubber hoses leave this box and feed to a kind of tent that\\nimprisons the operator’s nose and mouth; one hose is for the entrance\\nof air to be inhaled, the other for the exit of air to be exhaled, and\\nthe tongue closes off the former or the latter depending on the\\nbreather’s needs. But in my case, since I face considerable pressures\\nat the bottom of the sea, I needed to enclose my head in a copper\\nsphere, like those found on standard diving suits, and the two hoses\\nfor inhalation and exhalation now feed to that sphere.”\\n\\n“That’s perfect, Captain Nemo, but the air you carry must be quickly\\ndepleted; and once it contains no more than 15% oxygen, it becomes\\nunfit for breathing.”\\n\\n“Surely, but as I told you, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus’s pumps\\nenable me to store air under considerable pressure, and given this\\ncircumstance, the tank on my diving equipment can supply breathable\\nair for nine or ten hours.”\\n\\n“I’ve no more objections to raise,” I replied. “I’ll only ask you,\\ncaptain: how can you light your way at the bottom of the ocean?”\\n\\n“With the Ruhmkorff device, Professor Aronnax. If the first is carried\\non the back, the second is fastened to the belt. It consists of a\\nBunsen battery that I activate not with potassium dichromate but with\\nsodium. An induction coil gathers the electricity generated and\\ndirects it to a specially designed lantern. In this lantern one finds\\na glass spiral that contains only a residue of carbon dioxide\\ngas. When the device is operating, this gas becomes luminous and gives\\noff a continuous whitish light. Thus provided for, I breathe and I\\nsee.”\\n\\n“Captain Nemo, to my every objection you give such crushing answers,\\nI’m afraid to entertain a single doubt. However, though I have no\\nchoice but to accept both the Rouquayrol and Ruhmkorff devices, I’d\\nlike to register some reservations about the rifle with which you’ll\\nequip me.”\\n\\n“But it isn’t a rifle that uses gunpowder,” the captain replied.\\n\\n“Then it’s an air gun?”\\n\\n“Surely. How can I make gunpowder on my ship when I have no saltpeter,\\nsulfur, or charcoal?”\\n\\n“Even so,” I replied, “to fire underwater in a medium that’s 855 times\\ndenser than air, you’d have to overcome considerable resistance.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t necessarily follow. There are certain Fulton-style guns\\nperfected by the Englishmen Philippe-Coles and Burley, the Frenchman\\nFurcy, and the Italian Landi; they’re equipped with a special system\\nof airtight fastenings and can fire in underwater conditions. But I\\nrepeat: having no gunpowder, I’ve replaced it with air at high\\npressure, which is abundantly supplied me by the Nautilus’s pumps.”\\n\\n“But this air must be swiftly depleted.”\\n\\n“Well, in a pinch can’t my Rouquayrol tank supply me with more? All I\\nhave to do is draw it from an ad hoc spigot.* Besides, Professor\\nAronnax, you’ll see for yourself that during these underwater hunting\\ntrips, we make no great expenditure of either air or bullets.”\\n\\n*Latin: a spigot “just for that purpose.” Ed.\\n\\n“But it seems to me that in this semidarkness, amid this liquid that’s\\nso dense in comparison to the atmosphere, a gunshot couldn’t carry far\\nand would prove fatal only with difficulty!”\\n\\n“On the contrary, sir, with this rifle every shot is fatal; and as\\nsoon as the animal is hit, no matter how lightly, it falls as if\\nstruck by lightning.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because this rifle doesn’t shoot ordinary bullets but little glass\\ncapsules invented by the Austrian chemist Leniebroek, and I have a\\nconsiderable supply of them. These glass capsules are covered with a\\nstrip of steel and weighted with a lead base; they’re genuine little\\nLeyden jars charged with high-voltage electricity. They go off at the\\nslightest impact, and the animal, no matter how strong, drops dead. I\\nmight add that these capsules are no bigger than number 4 shot, and\\nthe chamber of any ordinary rifle could hold ten of them.”\\n\\n“I’ll quit debating,” I replied, getting up from the table. “And all\\nthat’s left is for me to shoulder my rifle. So where you go, I’ll go.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo led me to the Nautilus’s stern, and passing by Ned and\\nConseil’s cabin, I summoned my two companions, who instantly followed\\nus.\\n\\nThen we arrived at a cell located within easy access of the engine\\nroom; in this cell we were to get dressed for our stroll.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\nStrolling the Plains\\n\\n\\nTHIS CELL, properly speaking, was the Nautilus’s arsenal and\\nwardrobe. Hanging from its walls, a dozen diving outfits were waiting\\nfor anybody who wanted to take a stroll.\\n\\nAfter seeing these, Ned Land exhibited an obvious distaste for the\\nidea of putting one on.\\n\\n“But my gallant Ned,” I told him, “the forests of Crespo Island are\\nsimply underwater forests!”\\n\\n“Oh great!” put in the disappointed harpooner, watching his dreams of\\nfresh meat fade away. “And you, Professor Aronnax, are you going to\\nstick yourself inside these clothes?”\\n\\n“It has to be, Mr. Ned.”\\n\\n“Have it your way, sir,” the harpooner replied, shrugging his\\nshoulders. “But speaking for myself, I’ll never get into those things\\nunless they force me!”\\n\\n“No one will force you, Mr. Land,” Captain Nemo said.\\n\\n“And is Conseil going to risk it?” Ned asked.\\n\\n“Where master goes, I go,” Conseil replied.\\n\\nAt the captain’s summons, two crewmen came to help us put on these\\nheavy, waterproof clothes, made from seamless India rubber and\\nexpressly designed to bear considerable pressures. They were like\\nsuits of armor that were both yielding and resistant, you might\\nsay. These clothes consisted of jacket and pants. The pants ended in\\nbulky footwear adorned with heavy lead soles. The fabric of the jacket\\nwas reinforced with copper mail that shielded the chest, protected it\\nfrom the water’s pressure, and allowed the lungs to function freely;\\nthe sleeves ended in supple gloves that didn’t impede hand movements.\\n\\nThese perfected diving suits, it was easy to see, were a far cry from\\nsuch misshapen costumes as the cork breastplates, leather jumpers,\\nseagoing tunics, barrel helmets, etc., invented and acclaimed in the\\n18th century.\\n\\nConseil and I were soon dressed in these diving suits, as were Captain\\nNemo and one of his companions—a herculean type who must have been\\nprodigiously strong. All that remained was to encase one’s head in its\\nmetal sphere. But before proceeding with this operation, I asked the\\ncaptain for permission to examine the rifles set aside for us.\\n\\nOne of the Nautilus’s men presented me with a streamlined rifle whose\\nbutt was boilerplate steel, hollow inside, and of fairly large\\ndimensions. This served as a tank for the compressed air, which a\\ntrigger-operated valve could release into the metal chamber. In a\\ngroove where the butt was heaviest, a cartridge clip held some twenty\\nelectric bullets that, by means of a spring, automatically took their\\nplaces in the barrel of the rifle. As soon as one shot had been fired,\\nanother was ready to go off.\\n\\n“Captain Nemo,” I said, “this is an ideal, easy-to-use weapon. I ask\\nonly to put it to the test. But how will we reach the bottom of the\\nsea?”\\n\\n“Right now, professor, the Nautilus is aground in ten meters of water,\\nand we’ve only to depart.”\\n\\n“But how will we set out?”\\n\\n“You’ll see.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo inserted his cranium into its spherical headgear. Conseil\\nand I did the same, but not without hearing the Canadian toss us a\\nsarcastic “happy hunting.” On top, the suit ended in a collar of\\nthreaded copper onto which the metal helmet was screwed. Three holes,\\nprotected by heavy glass, allowed us to see in any direction with\\nsimply a turn of the head inside the sphere. Placed on our backs, the\\nRouquayrol device went into operation as soon as it was in position,\\nand for my part, I could breathe with ease.\\n\\nThe Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, my rifle in hand, I was ready\\nto go forth. But in all honesty, while imprisoned in these heavy\\nclothes and nailed to the deck by my lead soles, it was impossible for\\nme to take a single step.\\n\\nBut this circumstance had been foreseen, because I felt myself\\npropelled into a little room adjoining the wardrobe. Towed in the same\\nway, my companions went with me. I heard a door with watertight seals\\nclose after us, and we were surrounded by profound darkness.\\n\\nAfter some minutes a sharp hissing reached my ears. I felt a distinct\\nsensation of cold rising from my feet to my chest. Apparently a\\nstopcock inside the boat was letting in water from outside, which\\noverran us and soon filled up the room. Contrived in the Nautilus’s\\nside, a second door then opened. We were lit by a subdued light. An\\ninstant later our feet were treading the bottom of the sea.\\n\\nAnd now, how can I convey the impressions left on me by this stroll\\nunder the waters. Words are powerless to describe such wonders! When\\neven the painter’s brush can’t depict the effects unique to the liquid\\nelement, how can the writer’s pen hope to reproduce them?\\n\\nCaptain Nemo walked in front, and his companion followed us a few\\nsteps to the rear. Conseil and I stayed next to each other, as if\\ndaydreaming that through our metal carapaces, a little polite\\nconversation might still be possible! Already I no longer felt the\\nbulkiness of my clothes, footwear, and air tank, nor the weight of the\\nheavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its\\nshell. Once immersed in water, all these objects lost a part of their\\nweight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced, and thanks to\\nthis law of physics discovered by Archimedes, I did just fine. I was\\nno longer an inert mass, and I had, comparatively speaking, great\\nfreedom of movement.\\n\\nLighting up the seafloor even thirty feet beneath the surface of the\\nocean, the sun astonished me with its power. The solar rays easily\\ncrossed this aqueous mass and dispersed its dark colors. I could\\neasily distinguish objects 100 meters away. Farther on, the bottom was\\ntinted with fine shades of ultramarine; then, off in the distance, it\\nturned blue and faded in the midst of a hazy darkness. Truly, this\\nwater surrounding me was just a kind of air, denser than the\\natmosphere on land but almost as transparent. Above me I could see the\\ncalm surface of the ocean.\\n\\nWe were walking on sand that was fine-grained and smooth, not wrinkled\\nlike beach sand, which preserves the impressions left by the\\nwaves. This dazzling carpet was a real mirror, throwing back the sun’s\\nrays with startling intensity. The outcome: an immense vista of\\nreflections that penetrated every liquid molecule. Will anyone believe\\nme if I assert that at this thirty-foot depth, I could see as if it\\nwas broad daylight?\\n\\nFor a quarter of an hour, I trod this blazing sand, which was strewn\\nwith tiny crumbs of seashell. Looming like a long reef, the Nautilus’s\\nhull disappeared little by little, but when night fell in the midst of\\nthe waters, the ship’s beacon would surely facilitate our return on\\nboard, since its rays carried with perfect distinctness. This effect\\nis difficult to understand for anyone who has never seen light beams\\nso sharply defined on shore. There the dust that saturates the air\\ngives such rays the appearance of a luminous fog; but above water as\\nwell as underwater, shafts of electric light are transmitted with\\nincomparable clarity.\\n\\nMeanwhile we went ever onward, and these vast plains of sand seemed\\nendless. My hands parted liquid curtains that closed again behind me,\\nand my footprints faded swiftly under the water’s pressure.\\n\\nSoon, scarcely blurred by their distance from us, the forms of some\\nobjects took shape before my eyes. I recognized the lower slopes of\\nsome magnificent rocks carpeted by the finest zoophyte specimens, and\\nright off, I was struck by an effect unique to this medium.\\n\\nBy then it was ten o’clock in the morning. The sun’s rays hit the\\nsurface of the waves at a fairly oblique angle, decomposing by\\nrefraction as though passing through a prism; and when this light came\\nin contact with flowers, rocks, buds, seashells, and polyps, the edges\\nof these objects were shaded with all seven hues of the solar\\nspectrum. This riot of rainbow tints was a wonder, a feast for the\\neyes: a genuine kaleidoscope of red, green, yellow, orange, violet,\\nindigo, and blue; in short, the whole palette of a color-happy\\npainter! If only I had been able to share with Conseil the intense\\nsensations rising in my brain, competing with him in exclamations of\\nwonderment! If only I had known, like Captain Nemo and his companion,\\nhow to exchange thoughts by means of prearranged signals! So, for lack\\nof anything better, I talked to myself: I declaimed inside this copper\\nbox that topped my head, spending more air on empty words than was\\nperhaps advisable.\\n\\nConseil, like me, had stopped before this splendid sight. Obviously,\\nin the presence of these zoophyte and mollusk specimens, the fine lad\\nwas classifying his head off. Polyps and echinoderms abounded on the\\nseafloor: various isis coral, cornularian coral living in isolation,\\ntufts of virginal genus Oculina formerly known by the name “white\\ncoral,” prickly fungus coral in the shape of mushrooms, sea anemone\\nholding on by their muscular disks, providing a literal flowerbed\\nadorned by jellyfish from the genus Porpita wearing collars of azure\\ntentacles, and starfish that spangled the sand, including veinlike\\nfeather stars from the genus Asterophyton that were like fine lace\\nembroidered by the hands of water nymphs, their festoons swaying to\\nthe faint undulations caused by our walking. It filled me with real\\nchagrin to crush underfoot the gleaming mollusk samples that littered\\nthe seafloor by the thousands: concentric comb shells, hammer shells,\\ncoquina (seashells that actually hop around), top-shell snails, red\\nhelmet shells, angel-wing conchs, sea hares, and so many other\\nexhibits from this inexhaustible ocean. But we had to keep walking,\\nand we went forward while overhead there scudded schools of Portuguese\\nmen-of-war that let their ultramarine tentacles drift in their wakes,\\nmedusas whose milky white or dainty pink parasols were festooned with\\nazure tassels and shaded us from the sun’s rays, plus jellyfish of the\\nspecies Pelagia panopyra that, in the dark, would have strewn our path\\nwith phosphorescent glimmers!\\n\\nAll these wonders I glimpsed in the space of a quarter of a mile,\\nbarely pausing, following Captain Nemo whose gestures kept beckoning\\nme onward. Soon the nature of the seafloor changed. The plains of sand\\nwere followed by a bed of that viscous slime Americans call “ooze,”\\nwhich is composed exclusively of seashells rich in limestone or\\nsilica. Then we crossed a prairie of algae, open-sea plants that the\\nwaters hadn’t yet torn loose, whose vegetation grew in wild\\nprofusion. Soft to the foot, these densely textured lawns would have\\nrivaled the most luxuriant carpets woven by the hand of man. But while\\nthis greenery was sprawling under our steps, it didn’t neglect us\\noverhead. The surface of the water was crisscrossed by a floating\\narbor of marine plants belonging to that superabundant algae family\\nthat numbers more than 2,000 known species. I saw long ribbons of\\nfucus drifting above me, some globular, others tubular: Laurencia,\\nCladostephus with the slenderest foliage, Rhodymenia palmata\\nresembling the fan shapes of cactus. I observed that green-colored\\nplants kept closer to the surface of the sea, while reds occupied a\\nmedium depth, which left blacks and browns in charge of designing\\ngardens and flowerbeds in the ocean’s lower strata.\\n\\nThese algae are a genuine prodigy of creation, one of the wonders of\\nworld flora. This family produces both the biggest and smallest\\nvegetables in the world. Because, just as 40,000 near-invisible buds\\nhave been counted in one five-square-millimeter space, so also have\\nfucus plants been gathered that were over 500 meters long!\\n\\nWe had been gone from the Nautilus for about an hour and a half. It\\nwas almost noon. I spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the\\nsun’s rays, which were no longer refracted. The magic of these solar\\ncolors disappeared little by little, with emerald and sapphire shades\\nvanishing from our surroundings altogether. We walked with steady\\nsteps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity. The\\ntiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is\\nunaccustomed on shore. In fact, water is a better conductor of sound\\nthan air, and under the waves noises carry four times as fast.\\n\\nJust then the seafloor began to slope sharply downward. The light took\\non a uniform hue. We reached a depth of 100 meters, by which point we\\nwere undergoing a pressure of ten atmospheres. But my diving clothes\\nwere built along such lines that I never suffered from this\\npressure. I felt only a certain tightness in the joints of my fingers,\\nand even this discomfort soon disappeared. As for the exhaustion bound\\nto accompany a two-hour stroll in such unfamiliar trappings—it was\\nnil. Helped by the water, my movements were executed with startling\\nease.\\n\\nArriving at this 300-foot depth, I still detected the sun’s rays, but\\njust barely. Their intense brilliance had been followed by a reddish\\ntwilight, a midpoint between day and night. But we could see well\\nenough to find our way, and it still wasn’t necessary to activate the\\nRuhmkorff device.\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo stopped. He waited until I joined him, then he\\npointed a finger at some dark masses outlined in the shadows a short\\ndistance away.\\n\\n“It’s the forest of Crespo Island,” I thought; and I was not mistaken.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\nAn Underwater Forest\\n\\n\\nWE HAD FINALLY arrived on the outskirts of this forest, surely one of\\nthe finest in Captain Nemo’s immense domains. He regarded it as his\\nown and had laid the same claim to it that, in the first days of the\\nworld, the first men had to their forests on land. Besides, who else\\ncould dispute his ownership of this underwater property? What other,\\nbolder pioneer would come, ax in hand, to clear away its dark\\nunderbrush?\\n\\nThis forest was made up of big treelike plants, and when we entered\\nbeneath their huge arches, my eyes were instantly struck by the unique\\narrangement of their branches—an arrangement that I had never before\\nencountered.\\n\\nNone of the weeds carpeting the seafloor, none of the branches\\nbristling from the shrubbery, crept, or leaned, or stretched on a\\nhorizontal plane. They all rose right up toward the surface of the\\nocean. Every filament or ribbon, no matter how thin, stood ramrod\\nstraight. Fucus plants and creepers were growing in stiff\\nperpendicular lines, governed by the density of the element that\\ngenerated them. After I parted them with my hands, these otherwise\\nmotionless plants would shoot right back to their original\\npositions. It was the regime of verticality.\\n\\nI soon grew accustomed to this bizarre arrangement, likewise to the\\ncomparative darkness surrounding us. The seafloor in this forest was\\nstrewn with sharp chunks of stone that were hard to avoid. Here the\\nrange of underwater flora seemed pretty comprehensive to me, as well\\nas more abundant than it might have been in the arctic or tropical\\nzones, where such exhibits are less common. But for a few minutes I\\nkept accidentally confusing the two kingdoms, mistaking zoophytes for\\nwater plants, animals for vegetables. And who hasn’t made the same\\nblunder? Flora and fauna are so closely associated in the underwater\\nworld!\\n\\nI observed that all these exhibits from the vegetable kingdom were\\nattached to the seafloor by only the most makeshift methods. They had\\nno roots and didn’t care which solid objects secured them, sand,\\nshells, husks, or pebbles; they didn’t ask their hosts for sustenance,\\njust a point of purchase. These plants are entirely self-propagating,\\nand the principle of their existence lies in the water that sustains\\nand nourishes them. In place of leaves, most of them sprouted blades\\nof unpredictable shape, which were confined to a narrow gamut of\\ncolors consisting only of pink, crimson, green, olive, tan, and\\nbrown. There I saw again, but not yet pressed and dried like the\\nNautilus’s specimens, some peacock’s tails spread open like fans to\\nstir up a cooling breeze, scarlet rosetangle, sea tangle stretching\\nout their young and edible shoots, twisting strings of kelp from the\\ngenus Nereocystis that bloomed to a height of fifteen meters, bouquets\\nof mermaid’s cups whose stems grew wider at the top, and a number of\\nother open-sea plants, all without flowers. “It’s an odd anomaly in\\nthis bizarre element!” as one witty naturalist puts it. “The animal\\nkingdom blossoms, and the vegetable kingdom doesn’t!”\\n\\nThese various types of shrubbery were as big as trees in the temperate\\nzones; in the damp shade between them, there were clustered actual\\nbushes of moving flowers, hedges of zoophytes in which there grew\\nstony coral striped with twisting furrows, yellowish sea anemone from\\nthe genus Caryophylia with translucent tentacles, plus anemone with\\ngrassy tufts from the genus Zoantharia; and to complete the illusion,\\nminnows flitted from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds,\\nwhile there rose underfoot, like a covey of snipe, yellow fish from\\nthe genus Lepisocanthus with bristling jaws and sharp scales, flying\\ngurnards, and pinecone fish.\\n\\nNear one o’clock, Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt. Speaking for\\nmyself, I was glad to oblige, and we stretched out beneath an arbor of\\nwinged kelp, whose long thin tendrils stood up like arrows.\\n\\nThis short break was a delight. It lacked only the charm of\\nconversation. But it was impossible to speak, impossible to reply. I\\nsimply nudged my big copper headpiece against Conseil’s headpiece. I\\nsaw a happy gleam in the gallant lad’s eyes, and to communicate his\\npleasure, he jiggled around inside his carapace in the world’s\\nsilliest way.\\n\\nAfter four hours of strolling, I was quite astonished not to feel any\\nintense hunger. What kept my stomach in such a good mood I’m unable to\\nsay. But, in exchange, I experienced that irresistible desire for\\nsleep that comes over every diver. Accordingly, my eyes soon closed\\nbehind their heavy glass windows and I fell into an uncontrollable\\ndoze, which until then I had been able to fight off only through the\\nmovements of our walking. Captain Nemo and his muscular companion were\\nalready stretched out in this clear crystal, setting us a fine naptime\\nexample.\\n\\nHow long I was sunk in this torpor I cannot estimate; but when I\\nawoke, it seemed as if the sun were settling toward the\\nhorizon. Captain Nemo was already up, and I had started to stretch my\\nlimbs, when an unexpected apparition brought me sharply to my feet.\\n\\nA few paces away, a monstrous, meter-high sea spider was staring at me\\nwith beady eyes, poised to spring at me. Although my diving suit was\\nheavy enough to protect me from this animal’s bites, I couldn’t keep\\nback a shudder of horror. Just then Conseil woke up, together with the\\nNautilus’s sailor. Captain Nemo alerted his companion to this hideous\\ncrustacean, which a swing of the rifle butt quickly brought down, and\\nI watched the monster’s horrible legs writhing in dreadful\\nconvulsions.\\n\\nThis encounter reminded me that other, more daunting animals must be\\nlurking in these dark reaches, and my diving suit might not be\\nadequate protection against their attacks. Such thoughts hadn’t\\npreviously crossed my mind, and I was determined to keep on my\\nguard. Meanwhile I had assumed this rest period would be the turning\\npoint in our stroll, but I was mistaken; and instead of heading back\\nto the Nautilus, Captain Nemo continued his daring excursion.\\n\\nThe seafloor kept sinking, and its significantly steeper slope took us\\nto greater depths. It must have been nearly three o’clock when we\\nreached a narrow valley gouged between high, vertical walls and\\nlocated 150 meters down. Thanks to the perfection of our equipment, we\\nhad thus gone ninety meters below the limit that nature had, until\\nthen, set on man’s underwater excursions.\\n\\nI say 150 meters, although I had no instruments for estimating this\\ndistance. But I knew that the sun’s rays, even in the clearest seas,\\ncould reach no deeper. So at precisely this point the darkness became\\nprofound. Not a single object was visible past ten\\npaces. Consequently, I had begun to grope my way when suddenly I saw\\nthe glow of an intense white light. Captain Nemo had just activated\\nhis electric device. His companion did likewise. Conseil and I\\nfollowed suit. By turning a switch, I established contact between the\\ninduction coil and the glass spiral, and the sea, lit up by our four\\nlanterns, was illuminated for a radius of twenty-five meters.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo continued to plummet into the dark depths of this forest,\\nwhose shrubbery grew ever more sparse. I observed that vegetable life\\nwas disappearing more quickly than animal life. The open-sea plants\\nhad already left behind the increasingly arid seafloor, where a\\nprodigious number of animals were still swarming: zoophytes,\\narticulates, mollusks, and fish.\\n\\nWhile we were walking, I thought the lights of our Ruhmkorff devices\\nwould automatically attract some inhabitants of these dark strata. But\\nif they did approach us, at least they kept at a distance regrettable\\nfrom the hunter’s standpoint. Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop\\nand take aim with his rifle; then, after sighting down its barrel for\\na few seconds, he would straighten up and resume his walk.\\n\\nFinally, at around four o’clock, this marvelous excursion came to an\\nend. A wall of superb rocks stood before us, imposing in its sheer\\nmass: a pile of gigantic stone blocks, an enormous granite cliffside\\npitted with dark caves but not offering a single gradient we could\\nclimb up. This was the underpinning of Crespo Island. This was land.\\n\\nThe captain stopped suddenly. A gesture from him brought us to a halt,\\nand however much I wanted to clear this wall, I had to stop. Here\\nended the domains of Captain Nemo. He had no desire to pass beyond\\nthem. Farther on lay a part of the globe he would no longer tread\\nunderfoot.\\n\\nOur return journey began. Captain Nemo resumed the lead in our little\\nband, always heading forward without hesitation. I noted that we\\ndidn’t follow the same path in returning to the Nautilus. This new\\nroute, very steep and hence very arduous, quickly took us close to the\\nsurface of the sea. But this return to the upper strata wasn’t so\\nsudden that decompression took place too quickly, which could have led\\nto serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so\\nfatal to divers. With great promptness, the light reappeared and grew\\nstronger; and the refraction of the sun, already low on the horizon,\\nagain ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color\\nspectrum.\\n\\nAt a depth of ten meters, we walked amid a swarm of small fish from\\nevery species, more numerous than birds in the air, more agile too;\\nbut no aquatic game worthy of a gunshot had yet been offered to our\\neyes.\\n\\nJust then I saw the captain’s weapon spring to his shoulder and track\\na moving object through the bushes. A shot went off, I heard a faint\\nhissing, and an animal dropped a few paces away, literally struck by\\nlightning.\\n\\nIt was a magnificent sea otter from the genus Enhydra, the only\\nexclusively marine quadruped. One and a half meters long, this otter\\nhad to be worth a good high price. Its coat, chestnut brown above and\\nsilver below, would have made one of those wonderful fur pieces so\\nmuch in demand in the Russian and Chinese markets; the fineness and\\nluster of its pelt guaranteed that it would go for at least 2,000\\nfrancs. I was full of wonderment at this unusual mammal, with its\\ncircular head adorned by short ears, its round eyes, its white\\nwhiskers like those on a cat, its webbed and clawed feet, its bushy\\ntail. Hunted and trapped by fishermen, this valuable carnivore has\\nbecome extremely rare, and it takes refuge chiefly in the northernmost\\nparts of the Pacific, where in all likelihood its species will soon be\\nfacing extinction.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo’s companion picked up the animal, loaded it on his\\nshoulder, and we took to the trail again.\\n\\nFor an hour plains of sand unrolled before our steps. Often the\\nseafloor rose to within two meters of the surface of the water. I\\ncould then see our images clearly mirrored on the underside of the\\nwaves, but reflected upside down: above us there appeared an identical\\nband that duplicated our every movement and gesture; in short, a\\nperfect likeness of the quartet near which it walked, but with heads\\ndown and feet in the air.\\n\\nAnother unusual effect. Heavy clouds passed above us, forming and\\nfading swiftly. But after thinking it over, I realized that these\\nso-called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of the\\nlong ground swells, and I even spotted the foaming “white caps” that\\ntheir breaking crests were proliferating over the surface of the\\nwater. Lastly, I couldn’t help seeing the actual shadows of large\\nbirds passing over our heads, swiftly skimming the surface of the sea.\\n\\nOn this occasion I witnessed one of the finest gunshots ever to thrill\\nthe marrow of a hunter. A large bird with a wide wingspan, quite\\nclearly visible, approached and hovered over us. When it was just a\\nfew meters above the waves, Captain Nemo’s companion took aim and\\nfired. The animal dropped, electrocuted, and its descent brought it\\nwithin reach of our adroit hunter, who promptly took possession of\\nit. It was an albatross of the finest species, a wonderful specimen of\\nthese open-sea fowl.\\n\\nThis incident did not interrupt our walk. For two hours we were\\nsometimes led over plains of sand, sometimes over prairies of seaweed\\nthat were quite arduous to cross. In all honesty, I was dead tired by\\nthe time I spotted a hazy glow half a mile away, cutting through the\\ndarkness of the waters. It was the Nautilus’s beacon. Within twenty\\nminutes we would be on board, and there I could breathe easy\\nagain—because my tank’s current air supply seemed to be quite low in\\noxygen. But I was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed\\nour arrival.\\n\\nI was lagging behind some twenty paces when I saw Captain Nemo\\nsuddenly come back toward me. With his powerful hands he sent me\\nbuckling to the ground, while his companion did the same to\\nConseil. At first I didn’t know what to make of this sudden assault,\\nbut I was reassured to observe the captain lying motionless beside me.\\n\\nI was stretched out on the seafloor directly beneath some bushes of\\nalgae, when I raised my head and spied two enormous masses hurtling\\nby, throwing off phosphorescent glimmers.\\n\\nMy blood turned cold in my veins! I saw that we were under threat from\\na fearsome pair of sharks. They were blue sharks, dreadful man-eaters\\nwith enormous tails, dull, glassy stares, and phosphorescent matter\\noozing from holes around their snouts. They were like monstrous\\nfireflies that could thoroughly pulverize a man in their iron jaws! I\\ndon’t know if Conseil was busy with their classification, but as for\\nme, I looked at their silver bellies, their fearsome mouths bristling\\nwith teeth, from a viewpoint less than scientific—more as a victim\\nthan as a professor of natural history.\\n\\nLuckily these voracious animals have poor eyesight. They went by\\nwithout noticing us, grazing us with their brownish fins; and\\nmiraculously, we escaped a danger greater than encountering a tiger\\ndeep in the jungle.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, guided by its electric trail, we reached the\\nNautilus. The outside door had been left open, and Captain Nemo closed\\nit after we reentered the first cell. Then he pressed a button. I\\nheard pumps operating within the ship, I felt the water lowering\\naround me, and in a few moments the cell was completely empty. The\\ninside door opened, and we passed into the wardrobe.\\n\\nThere our diving suits were removed, not without difficulty; and\\nutterly exhausted, faint from lack of food and rest, I repaired to my\\nstateroom, full of wonder at this startling excursion on the bottom of\\nthe sea.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\nFour Thousand Leagues Under the Pacific\\n\\n\\nBY THE NEXT MORNING, November 18, I was fully recovered from my\\nexhaustion of the day before, and I climbed onto the platform just as\\nthe Nautilus’s chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase. It then\\noccurred to me that these words either referred to the state of the\\nsea, or that they meant: “There’s nothing in sight.”\\n\\nAnd in truth, the ocean was deserted. Not a sail on the horizon. The\\ntips of Crespo Island had disappeared during the night. The sea,\\nabsorbing every color of the prism except its blue rays, reflected the\\nlatter in every direction and sported a wonderful indigo tint. The\\nundulating waves regularly took on the appearance of watered silk with\\nwide stripes.\\n\\nI was marveling at this magnificent ocean view when Captain Nemo\\nappeared. He didn’t seem to notice my presence and began a series of\\nastronomical observations. Then, his operations finished, he went and\\nleaned his elbows on the beacon housing, his eyes straying over the\\nsurface of the ocean.\\n\\nMeanwhile some twenty of the Nautilus’s sailors—all energetic,\\nwell-built fellows—climbed onto the platform. They had come to pull up\\nthe nets left in our wake during the night. These seamen obviously\\nbelonged to different nationalities, although indications of European\\nphysical traits could be seen in them all. If I’m not mistaken, I\\nrecognized some Irishmen, some Frenchmen, a few Slavs, and a native of\\neither Greece or Crete. Even so, these men were frugal of speech and\\nused among themselves only that bizarre dialect whose origin I\\ncouldn’t even guess. So I had to give up any notions of questioning\\nthem.\\n\\nThe nets were hauled on board. They were a breed of trawl resembling\\nthose used off the Normandy coast, huge pouches held half open by a\\nfloating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes. Trailing in\\nthis way from these iron glove makers, the resulting receptacles\\nscoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their\\npath. That day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these\\nfish-filled waterways: anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them\\nfor the epithet “clowns,” black Commerson anglers equipped with their\\nantennas, undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands,\\nbloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious, some olive-hued\\nlampreys, snipefish covered with silver scales, cutlass fish whose\\nelectrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric\\nray, scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands, greenish codfish,\\nseveral varieties of goby, etc.; finally, some fish of larger\\nproportions: a one-meter jack with a prominent head, several fine\\nbonito from the genus Scomber decked out in the colors blue and\\nsilver, and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds couldn’t save\\nthem from our trawl.\\n\\nI estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000 pounds\\nof fish. It was a fine catch but not surprising. In essence, these\\nnets stayed in our wake for several hours, incarcerating an entire\\naquatic world in prisons made of thread. So we were never lacking in\\nprovisions of the highest quality, which the Nautilus’s speed and the\\nallure of its electric light could continually replenish.\\n\\nThese various exhibits from the sea were immediately lowered down the\\nhatch in the direction of the storage lockers, some to be eaten fresh,\\nothers to be preserved.\\n\\nAfter its fishing was finished and its air supply renewed, I thought\\nthe Nautilus would resume its underwater excursion, and I was getting\\nready to return to my stateroom, when Captain Nemo turned to me and\\nsaid without further preamble:\\n\\n“Look at this ocean, professor! Doesn’t it have the actual gift of\\nlife? Doesn’t it experience both anger and affection? Last evening it\\nwent to sleep just as we did, and there it is, waking up after a\\npeaceful night!”\\n\\nNo hellos or good mornings for this gent! You would have thought this\\neccentric individual was simply continuing a conversation we’d already\\nstarted!\\n\\n“See!” he went on. “It’s waking up under the sun’s caresses! It’s\\ngoing to relive its daily existence! What a fascinating field of study\\nlies in watching the play of its organism. It owns a pulse and\\narteries, it has spasms, and I side with the scholarly Commander\\nMaury, who discovered that it has a circulation as real as the\\ncirculation of blood in animals.”\\n\\nI’m sure that Captain Nemo expected no replies from me, and it seemed\\npointless to pitch in with “Ah yes,” “Exactly,” or “How right you\\nare!” Rather, he was simply talking to himself, with long pauses\\nbetween sentences. He was meditating out loud.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, “the ocean owns a genuine circulation, and to start it\\ngoing, the Creator of All Things has only to increase its heat, salt,\\nand microscopic animal life. In essence, heat creates the different\\ndensities that lead to currents and countercurrents. Evaporation,\\nwhich is nil in the High Arctic regions and very active in equatorial\\nzones, brings about a constant interchange of tropical and polar\\nwaters. What’s more, I’ve detected those falling and rising currents\\nthat make up the ocean’s true breathing. I’ve seen a molecule of salt\\nwater heat up at the surface, sink into the depths, reach maximum\\ndensity at -2 degrees centigrade, then cool off, grow lighter, and\\nrise again. At the poles you’ll see the consequences of this\\nphenomenon, and through this law of farseeing nature, you’ll\\nunderstand why water can freeze only at the surface!”\\n\\nAs the captain was finishing his sentence, I said to myself: “The\\npole! Is this brazen individual claiming he’ll take us even to that\\nlocation?”\\n\\nMeanwhile the captain fell silent and stared at the element he had\\nstudied so thoroughly and unceasingly. Then, going on:\\n\\n“Salts,” he said, “fill the sea in considerable quantities, professor,\\nand if you removed all its dissolved saline content, you’d create a\\nmass measuring 4,500,000 cubic leagues, which if it were spread all\\nover the globe, would form a layer more than ten meters high. And\\ndon’t think that the presence of these salts is due merely to some\\nwhim of nature. No. They make ocean water less open to evaporation and\\nprevent winds from carrying off excessive amounts of steam, which,\\nwhen condensing, would submerge the temperate zones. Salts play a\\nleading role, the role of stabilizer for the general ecology of the\\nglobe!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stopped, straightened up, took a few steps along the\\nplatform, and returned to me:\\n\\n“As for those billions of tiny animals,” he went on, “those infusoria\\nthat live by the millions in one droplet of water, 800,000 of which\\nare needed to weigh one milligram, their role is no less\\nimportant. They absorb the marine salts, they assimilate the solid\\nelements in the water, and since they create coral and madrepores,\\nthey’re the true builders of limestone continents! And so, after\\nthey’ve finished depriving our water drop of its mineral nutrients,\\nthe droplet gets lighter, rises to the surface, there absorbs more\\nsalts left behind through evaporation, gets heavier, sinks again, and\\nbrings those tiny animals new elements to absorb. The outcome: a\\ndouble current, rising and falling, constant movement, constant life!\\nMore intense than on land, more abundant, more infinite, such life\\nblooms in every part of this ocean, an element fatal to man, they say,\\nbut vital to myriads of animals—and to me!”\\n\\nWhen Captain Nemo spoke in this way, he was transfigured, and he\\nfilled me with extraordinary excitement.\\n\\n“There,” he added, “out there lies true existence! And I can imagine\\nthe founding of nautical towns, clusters of underwater households\\nthat, like the Nautilus, would return to the surface of the sea to\\nbreathe each morning, free towns if ever there were, independent\\ncities! Then again, who knows whether some tyrant . . .”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo finished his sentence with a vehement gesture. Then,\\naddressing me directly, as if to drive away an ugly thought:\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he asked me, “do you know the depth of the ocean\\nfloor?”\\n\\n“At least, captain, I know what the major soundings tell us.”\\n\\n“Could you quote them to me, so I can double-check them as the need\\narises?”\\n\\n“Here,” I replied, “are a few of them that stick in my memory. If I’m\\nnot mistaken, an average depth of 8,200 meters was found in the north\\nAtlantic, and 2,500 meters in the Mediterranean. The most remarkable\\nsoundings were taken in the south Atlantic near the 35th parallel, and\\nthey gave 12,000 meters, 14,091 meters, and 15,149 meters. All in all,\\nit’s estimated that if the sea bottom were made level, its average\\ndepth would be about seven kilometers.”\\n\\n“Well, professor,” Captain Nemo replied, “we’ll show you better than\\nthat, I hope. As for the average depth of this part of the Pacific,\\nI’ll inform you that it’s a mere 4,000 meters.”\\n\\nThis said, Captain Nemo headed to the hatch and disappeared down the\\nladder. I followed him and went back to the main lounge. The propeller\\nwas instantly set in motion, and the log gave our speed as twenty\\nmiles per hour.\\n\\nOver the ensuing days and weeks, Captain Nemo was very frugal with his\\nvisits. I saw him only at rare intervals. His chief officer regularly\\nfixed the positions I found reported on the chart, and in such a way\\nthat I could exactly plot the Nautilus’s course.\\n\\nConseil and Land spent the long hours with me. Conseil had told his\\nfriend about the wonders of our undersea stroll, and the Canadian was\\nsorry he hadn’t gone along. But I hoped an opportunity would arise for\\na visit to the forests of Oceania.\\n\\nAlmost every day the panels in the lounge were open for some hours,\\nand our eyes never tired of probing the mysteries of the underwater\\nworld.\\n\\nThe Nautilus’s general heading was southeast, and it stayed at a depth\\nbetween 100 and 150 meters. However, from lord-knows-what whim, one\\nday it did a diagonal dive by means of its slanting fins, reaching\\nstrata located 2,000 meters underwater. The thermometer indicated a\\ntemperature of 4.25 degrees centigrade, which at this depth seemed to\\nbe a temperature common to all latitudes.\\n\\nOn November 26, at three o’clock in the morning, the Nautilus cleared\\nthe Tropic of Cancer at longitude 172 degrees. On the 27th it passed\\nin sight of the Hawaiian Islands, where the famous Captain Cook met\\nhis death on February 14, 1779. By then we had fared 4,860 leagues\\nfrom our starting point. When I arrived on the platform that morning,\\nI saw the Island of Hawaii two miles to leeward, the largest of the\\nseven islands making up this group. I could clearly distinguish the\\ntilled soil on its outskirts, the various mountain chains running\\nparallel with its coastline, and its volcanoes, crowned by Mauna Kea,\\nwhose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level. Among other specimens\\nfrom these waterways, our nets brought up some peacock-tailed\\nflabellarian coral, polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to\\nthis part of the ocean.\\n\\nThe Nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading. On December 1 it cut\\nthe equator at longitude 142 degrees, and on the 4th of the same\\nmonth, after a quick crossing marked by no incident, we raised the\\nMarquesas Islands. Three miles off, in latitude 8 degrees 57’ south\\nand longitude 139 degrees 32’ west, I spotted Martin Point on Nuku\\nHiva, chief member of this island group that belongs to France. I\\ncould make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon, because\\nCaptain Nemo hated to hug shore. There our nets brought up some fine\\nfish samples: dolphinfish with azure fins, gold tails, and flesh\\nthat’s unrivaled in the entire world, wrasse from the genus\\nHologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in\\nflavor, knifejaws with bony beaks, yellowish albacore that were as\\ntasty as bonito, all fish worth classifying in the ship’s pantry.\\n\\nAfter leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the French\\nflag, the Nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from December 4 to the\\n11th. Its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school\\nof squid, unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the\\ncuttlefish. French fishermen give them the name “cuckoldfish,” and\\nthey belong to the class Cephalopoda, family Dibranchiata, consisting\\nof themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts. The naturalists\\nof antiquity made a special study of them, and these animals furnished\\nmany ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the Greek\\nmarketplace, as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich\\ncitizens, if we’re to believe Athenaeus, a Greek physician predating\\nGalen.\\n\\nIt was during the night of December 9-10 that the Nautilus encountered\\nthis army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks. They numbered in the\\nmillions. They were migrating from the temperate zones toward zones\\nstill warmer, following the itineraries of herring and sardines. We\\nstared at them through our thick glass windows: they swam backward\\nwith tremendous speed, moving by means of their locomotive tubes,\\nchasing fish and mollusks, eating the little ones, eaten by the big\\nones, and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature\\nhas rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic\\nsnakes. Despite its speed, the Nautilus navigated for several hours in\\nthe midst of this school of animals, and its nets brought up an\\nincalculable number, among which I recognized all nine species that\\nProfessor Orbigny has classified as native to the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nDuring this crossing, the sea continually lavished us with the most\\nmarvelous sights. Its variety was infinite. It changed its setting and\\ndecor for the mere pleasure of our eyes, and we were called upon not\\nsimply to contemplate the works of our Creator in the midst of the\\nliquid element, but also to probe the ocean’s most daunting mysteries.\\n\\nDuring the day of December 11, I was busy reading in the main\\nlounge. Ned Land and Conseil were observing the luminous waters\\nthrough the gaping panels. The Nautilus was motionless. Its ballast\\ntanks full, it was sitting at a depth of 1,000 meters in a\\ncomparatively unpopulated region of the ocean where only larger fish\\nput in occasional appearances.\\n\\nJust then I was studying a delightful book by Jean MacΘ, The Servants\\nof the Stomach, and savoring its ingenious teachings, when Conseil\\ninterrupted my reading.\\n\\n“Would master kindly come here for an instant?” he said to me in an\\nodd voice.\\n\\n“What is it, Conseil?”\\n\\n“It’s something that master should see.”\\n\\nI stood up, went, leaned on my elbows before the window, and I saw it.\\n\\nIn the broad electric daylight, an enormous black mass, quite\\nmotionless, hung suspended in the midst of the waters. I observed it\\ncarefully, trying to find out the nature of this gigantic\\ncetacean. Then a sudden thought crossed my mind.\\n\\n“A ship!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes,” the Canadian replied, “a disabled craft that’s sinking straight\\ndown!”\\n\\nNed Land was not mistaken. We were in the presence of a ship whose\\nsevered shrouds still hung from their clasps. Its hull looked in good\\ncondition, and it must have gone under only a few hours before. The\\nstumps of three masts, chopped off two feet above the deck, indicated\\na flooding ship that had been forced to sacrifice its masting. But it\\nhad heeled sideways, filling completely, and it was listing to port\\neven yet. A sorry sight, this carcass lost under the waves, but\\nsorrier still was the sight on its deck, where, lashed with ropes to\\nprevent their being washed overboard, some human corpses still lay! I\\ncounted four of them—four men, one still standing at the helm—then a\\nwoman, halfway out of a skylight on the afterdeck, holding a child in\\nher arms. This woman was young. Under the brilliant lighting of the\\nNautilus’s rays, I could make out her features, which the water hadn’t\\nyet decomposed. With a supreme effort, she had lifted her child above\\nher head, and the poor little creature’s arms were still twined around\\nits mother’s neck! The postures of the four seamen seemed ghastly to\\nme, twisted from convulsive movements, as if making a last effort to\\nbreak loose from the ropes that bound them to their ship. And the\\nhelmsman, standing alone, calmer, his face smooth and serious, his\\ngrizzled hair plastered to his brow, his hands clutching the wheel,\\nseemed even yet to be guiding his wrecked three-master through the\\nocean depths!\\n\\nWhat a scene! We stood dumbstruck, hearts pounding, before this\\nshipwreck caught in the act, as if it had been photographed in its\\nfinal moments, so to speak! And already I could see enormous sharks\\nmoving in, eyes ablaze, drawn by the lure of human flesh!\\n\\nMeanwhile, turning, the Nautilus made a circle around the sinking\\nship, and for an instant I could read the board on its stern:\\n\\nThe Florida Sunderland, England\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\nVanikoro\\n\\n\\nTHIS DREADFUL SIGHT was the first of a whole series of maritime\\ncatastrophes that the Nautilus would encounter on its run. When it\\nplied more heavily traveled seas, we often saw wrecked hulls rotting\\nin midwater, and farther down, cannons, shells, anchors, chains, and a\\nthousand other iron objects rusting away.\\n\\nMeanwhile, continuously swept along by the Nautilus, where we lived in\\nnear isolation, we raised the Tuamotu Islands on December 11, that old\\n“dangerous group” associated with the French global navigator\\nCommander Bougainville; it stretches from Ducie Island to Lazareff\\nIsland over an area of 500 leagues from the east-southeast to the\\nwest-northwest, between latitude 13 degrees 30’ and 23 degrees 50’\\nsouth, and between longitude 125 degrees 30’ and 151 degrees 30’\\nwest. This island group covers a surface area of 370 square leagues,\\nand it’s made up of some sixty subgroups, among which we noted the\\nGambier group, which is a French protectorate. These islands are coral\\nformations. Thanks to the work of polyps, a slow but steady upheaval\\nwill someday connect these islands to each other. Later on, this new\\nisland will be fused to its neighboring island groups, and a fifth\\ncontinent will stretch from New Zealand and New Caledonia as far as\\nthe Marquesas Islands.\\n\\nThe day I expounded this theory to Captain Nemo, he answered me\\ncoldly:\\n\\n“The earth doesn’t need new continents, but new men!”\\n\\nSailors’ luck led the Nautilus straight to Reao Island, one of the\\nmost unusual in this group, which was discovered in 1822 by Captain\\nBell aboard the Minerva. So I was able to study the madreporic process\\nthat has created the islands in this ocean.\\n\\nMadrepores, which one must guard against confusing with precious\\ncoral, clothe their tissue in a limestone crust, and their variations\\nin structure have led my famous mentor Professor Milne-Edwards to\\nclassify them into five divisions. The tiny microscopic animals that\\nsecrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their\\ncells. Their limestone deposits build up into rocks, reefs, islets,\\nislands. In some places, they form atolls, a circular ring surrounding\\na lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the\\nsea. Elsewhere, they take the shape of barrier reefs, such as those\\nthat exist along the coasts of New Caledonia and several of the\\nTuamotu Islands. In still other localities, such as RΘunion Island and\\nthe island of Mauritius, they build fringing reefs, high, straight\\nwalls next to which the ocean’s depth is considerable.\\n\\nWhile cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of\\nReao Island, I marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by\\nthese microscopic laborers. These walls were the express achievements\\nof madrepores known by the names fire coral, finger coral, star coral,\\nand stony coral. These polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata\\nat the surface of the sea, and so it’s in the upper reaches that they\\nbegin these substructures, which sink little by little together with\\nthe secreted rubble binding them. This, at least, is the theory of\\nMr. Charles Darwin, who thus explains the formation of atolls—a theory\\nsuperior, in my view, to the one that says these madreporic edifices\\nsit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet\\nbelow sea level.\\n\\nI could observe these strange walls quite closely: our sounding lines\\nindicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than 300 meters,\\nand our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle.\\n\\nIn reply to a question Conseil asked me about the growth rate of these\\ncolossal barriers, I thoroughly amazed him by saying that scientists\\nput it at an eighth of an inch per biennium.\\n\\n“Therefore,” he said to me, “to build these walls, it took . . . ?”\\n\\n“192,000 years, my gallant Conseil, which significantly extends the\\nbiblical Days of Creation. What’s more, the formation of coal—in other\\nwords, the petrification of forests swallowed by floods—and the\\ncooling of basaltic rocks likewise call for a much longer period of\\ntime. I might add that those ‘days’ in the Bible must represent whole\\nepochs and not literally the lapse of time between two sunrises,\\nbecause according to the Bible itself, the sun doesn’t date from the\\nfirst day of Creation.”\\n\\nWhen the Nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean, I could take\\nin Reao Island over its whole flat, wooded expanse. Obviously its\\nmadreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and\\nthunderstorms. One day, carried off by a hurricane from neighboring\\nshores, some seed fell onto these limestone beds, mixing with\\ndecomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable\\nhumus. Propelled by the waves, a coconut arrived on this new\\ncoast. Its germ took root. Its tree grew tall, catching steam off the\\nwater. A brook was born. Little by little, vegetation spread. Tiny\\nanimals—worms, insects—rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from\\nislands to windward. Turtles came to lay their eggs. Birds nested in\\nthe young trees. In this way animal life developed, and drawn by the\\ngreenery and fertile soil, man appeared. And that’s how these islands\\nwere formed, the immense achievement of microscopic animals.\\n\\nNear evening Reao Island melted into the distance, and the Nautilus\\nnoticeably changed course. After touching the Tropic of Capricorn at\\nlongitude 135 degrees, it headed west-northwest, going back up the\\nwhole intertropical zone. Although the summer sun lavished its rays on\\nus, we never suffered from the heat, because thirty or forty meters\\nunderwater, the temperature didn’t go over 10 degrees to 12 degrees\\ncentigrade.\\n\\nBy December 15 we had left the alluring Society Islands in the west,\\nlikewise elegant Tahiti, queen of the Pacific. In the morning I\\nspotted this island’s lofty summits a few miles to leeward. Its waters\\nsupplied excellent fish for the tables on board: mackerel, bonito,\\nalbacore, and a few varieties of that sea serpent named the moray eel.\\n\\nThe Nautilus had cleared 8,100 miles. We logged 9,720 miles when we\\npassed between the Tonga Islands, where crews from the Argo,\\nPort-au-Prince, and Duke of Portland had perished, and the island\\ngroup of Samoa, scene of the slaying of Captain de Langle, friend of\\nthat long-lost navigator, the Count de La PΘrouse. Then we raised the\\nFiji Islands, where savages slaughtered sailors from the Union, as\\nwell as Captain Bureau, commander of the Darling Josephine out of\\nNantes, France.\\n\\nExtending over an expanse of 100 leagues north to south, and over 90\\nleagues east to west, this island group lies between latitude 2\\ndegrees and 6 degrees south, and between longitude 174 degrees and 179\\ndegrees west. It consists of a number of islands, islets, and reefs,\\namong which we noted the islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Kadavu.\\n\\nIt was the Dutch navigator Tasman who discovered this group in 1643,\\nthe same year the Italian physicist Torricelli invented the barometer\\nand King Louis XIV ascended the French throne. I’ll let the reader\\ndecide which of these deeds was more beneficial to humanity. Coming\\nlater, Captain Cook in 1774, Rear Admiral d’Entrecasteaux in 1793, and\\nfinally Captain Dumont d’Urville in 1827, untangled the whole chaotic\\ngeography of this island group. The Nautilus drew near Wailea Bay, an\\nunlucky place for England’s Captain Dillon, who was the first to shed\\nlight on the longstanding mystery surrounding the disappearance of\\nships under the Count de La PΘrouse.\\n\\nThis bay, repeatedly dredged, furnished a huge supply of excellent\\noysters. As the Roman playwright Seneca recommended, we opened them\\nright at our table, then stuffed ourselves. These mollusks belonged to\\nthe species known by name as Ostrea lamellosa, whose members are quite\\ncommon off Corsica. This Wailea oysterbank must have been extensive,\\nand for certain, if they hadn’t been controlled by numerous natural\\nchecks, these clusters of shellfish would have ended up jam-packing\\nthe bay, since as many as 2,000,000 eggs have been counted in a single\\nindividual.\\n\\nAnd if Mr. Ned Land did not repent of his gluttony at our oyster fest,\\nit’s because oysters are the only dish that never causes\\nindigestion. In fact, it takes no less than sixteen dozen of these\\nheadless mollusks to supply the 315 grams that satisfy one man’s\\nminimum daily requirement for nitrogen.\\n\\nOn December 25 the Nautilus navigated amid the island group of the New\\nHebrides, which the Portuguese seafarer Queir≤s discovered in 1606,\\nwhich Commander Bougainville explored in 1768, and to which Captain\\nCook gave its current name in 1773. This group is chiefly made up of\\nnine large islands and forms a 120-league strip from the\\nnorth-northwest to the south-southeast, lying between latitude 2\\ndegrees and 15 degrees south, and between longitude 164 degrees and\\n168 degrees. At the moment of our noon sights, we passed fairly close\\nto the island of Aurou, which looked to me like a mass of green woods\\ncrowned by a peak of great height.\\n\\nThat day it was yuletide, and it struck me that Ned Land badly missed\\ncelebrating “Christmas,” that genuine family holiday where Protestants\\nare such zealots.\\n\\nI hadn’t seen Captain Nemo for over a week, when, on the morning of\\nthe 27th, he entered the main lounge, as usual acting as if he’d been\\ngone for just five minutes. I was busy tracing the Nautilus’s course\\non the world map. The captain approached, placed a finger over a\\nposition on the chart, and pronounced just one word:\\n\\n“Vanikoro.”\\n\\nThis name was magic! It was the name of those islets where vessels\\nunder the Count de La PΘrouse had miscarried. I straightened suddenly.\\n\\n“The Nautilus is bringing us to Vanikoro?” I asked.\\n\\n“Yes, professor,” the captain replied.\\n\\n“And I’ll be able to visit those famous islands where the Compass and\\nthe Astrolabe came to grief?”\\n\\n“If you like, professor.”\\n\\n“When will we reach Vanikoro?”\\n\\n“We already have, professor.”\\n\\nFollowed by Captain Nemo, I climbed onto the platform, and from there\\nmy eyes eagerly scanned the horizon.\\n\\nIn the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size,\\nsurrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles. We were\\nfacing the island of Vanikoro proper, to which Captain Dumont\\nd’Urville had given the name “Island of the Search”; we lay right in\\nfront of the little harbor of Vana, located in latitude 16 degrees 4’\\nsouth and longitude 164 degrees 32’ east. Its shores seemed covered\\nwith greenery from its beaches to its summits inland, crowned by\\nMt. Kapogo, which is 476 fathoms high.\\n\\nAfter clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway, the\\nNautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty\\nto forty fathoms. Under the green shade of some tropical evergreens, I\\nspotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our\\napproach. In this long, blackish object advancing flush with the\\nwater, didn’t they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged\\nto view with distrust?\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the shipwreck of the\\nCount de La PΘrouse.\\n\\n“What everybody knows, captain,” I answered him.\\n\\n“And could you kindly tell me what everybody knows?” he asked me in a\\ngently ironic tone.\\n\\n“Very easily.”\\n\\nI related to him what the final deeds of Captain Dumont d’Urville had\\nbrought to light, deeds described here in this heavily condensed\\nsummary of the whole matter.\\n\\nIn 1785 the Count de La PΘrouse and his subordinate, Captain de\\nLangle, were sent by King Louis XVI of France on a voyage to\\ncircumnavigate the globe. They boarded two sloops of war, the Compass\\nand the Astrolabe, which were never seen again.\\n\\nIn 1791, justly concerned about the fate of these two sloops of war,\\nthe French government fitted out two large cargo boats, the Search and\\nthe Hope, which left Brest on September 28 under orders from Rear\\nAdmiral Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. Two months later, testimony from a\\ncertain Commander Bowen, aboard the Albemarle, alleged that rubble\\nfrom shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coast of New\\nGeorgia. But d’Entrecasteaux was unaware of this news—which seemed a\\nbit dubious anyhow—and headed toward the Admiralty Islands, which had\\nbeen named in a report by one Captain Hunter as the site of the Count\\nde La PΘrouse’s shipwreck.\\n\\nThey looked in vain. The Hope and the Search passed right by Vanikoro\\nwithout stopping there; and overall, this voyage was plagued by\\nmisfortune, ultimately costing the lives of Rear Admiral\\nd’Entrecasteaux, two of his subordinate officers, and several seamen\\nfrom his crew.\\n\\nIt was an old hand at the Pacific, the English adventurer Captain\\nPeter Dillon, who was the first to pick up the trail left by castaways\\nfrom the wrecked vessels. On May 15, 1824, his ship, the St. Patrick,\\npassed by Tikopia Island, one of the New Hebrides. There a native\\nboatman pulled alongside in a dugout canoe and sold Dillon a silver\\nsword hilt bearing the imprint of characters engraved with a cutting\\ntool known as a burin. Furthermore, this native boatman claimed that\\nduring a stay in Vanikoro six years earlier, he had seen two Europeans\\nbelonging to ships that had run aground on the island’s reefs many\\nyears before.\\n\\nDillon guessed that the ships at issue were those under the Count de\\nLa PΘrouse, ships whose disappearance had shaken the entire world. He\\ntried to reach Vanikoro, where, according to the native boatman, a\\ngood deal of rubble from the shipwreck could still be found, but winds\\nand currents prevented his doing so.\\n\\nDillon returned to Calcutta. There he was able to interest the Asiatic\\nSociety and the East India Company in his discovery. A ship named\\nafter the Search was placed at his disposal, and he departed on\\nJanuary 23, 1827, accompanied by a French deputy.\\n\\nThis new Search, after putting in at several stops over the Pacific,\\ndropped anchor before Vanikoro on July 7, 1827, in the same harbor of\\nVana where the Nautilus was currently floating.\\n\\nThere Dillon collected many relics of the shipwreck: iron utensils,\\nanchors, eyelets from pulleys, swivel guns, an eighteen-pound shell,\\nthe remains of some astronomical instruments, a piece of sternrail,\\nand a bronze bell bearing the inscription “Made by Bazin,” the foundry\\nmark at Brest Arsenal around 1785. There could no longer be any doubt.\\n\\nFinishing his investigations, Dillon stayed at the site of the\\ncasualty until the month of October. Then he left Vanikoro, headed\\ntoward New Zealand, dropped anchor at Calcutta on April 7, 1828, and\\nreturned to France, where he received a very cordial welcome from King\\nCharles X.\\n\\nBut just then the renowned French explorer Captain Dumont d’Urville,\\nunaware of Dillon’s activities, had already set sail to search\\nelsewhere for the site of the shipwreck. In essence, a whaling vessel\\nhad reported that some medals and a Cross of St. Louis had been found\\nin the hands of savages in the Louisiade Islands and New Caledonia.\\n\\nSo Captain Dumont d’Urville had put to sea in command of a vessel\\nnamed after the Astrolabe, and just two months after Dillon had left\\nVanikoro, Dumont d’Urville dropped anchor before Hobart. There he\\nheard about Dillon’s findings, and he further learned that a certain\\nJames Hobbs, chief officer on the Union out of Calcutta, had put to\\nshore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18’ south and\\nlongitude 156 degrees 30’ east, and had noted the natives of those\\nwaterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics.\\n\\nPretty perplexed, Dumont d’Urville didn’t know if he should give\\ncredence to these reports, which had been carried in some of the less\\nreliable newspapers; nevertheless, he decided to start on Dillon’s\\ntrail.\\n\\nOn February 10, 1828, the new Astrolabe hove before Tikopia Island,\\ntook on a guide and interpreter in the person of a deserter who had\\nsettled there, plied a course toward Vanikoro, raised it on February\\n12, sailed along its reefs until the 14th, and only on the 20th\\ndropped anchor inside its barrier in the harbor of Vana.\\n\\nOn the 23rd, several officers circled the island and brought back some\\nrubble of little importance. The natives, adopting a system of denial\\nand evasion, refused to guide them to the site of the casualty. This\\nrather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives had\\nmistreated the castaways; and in truth, the natives seemed afraid that\\nDumont d’Urville had come to avenge the Count de La PΘrouse and his\\nunfortunate companions.\\n\\nBut on the 26th, appeased with gifts and seeing that they didn’t need\\nto fear any reprisals, the natives led the chief officer,\\nMr. Jacquinot, to the site of the shipwreck.\\n\\nAt this location, in three or four fathoms of water between the Paeu\\nand Vana reefs, there lay some anchors, cannons, and ingots of iron\\nand lead, all caked with limestone concretions. A launch and whaleboat\\nfrom the new Astrolabe were steered to this locality, and after going\\nto exhausting lengths, their crews managed to dredge up an anchor\\nweighing 1,800 pounds, a cast-iron eight-pounder cannon, a lead ingot,\\nand two copper swivel guns.\\n\\nQuestioning the natives, Captain Dumont d’Urville also learned that\\nafter La PΘrouse’s two ships had miscarried on the island’s reefs, the\\ncount had built a smaller craft, only to go off and miscarry a second\\ntime. Where? Nobody knew.\\n\\nThe commander of the new Astrolabe then had a monument erected under a\\ntuft of mangrove, in memory of the famous navigator and his\\ncompanions. It was a simple quadrangular pyramid, set on a coral base,\\nwith no ironwork to tempt the natives’ avarice.\\n\\nThen Dumont d’Urville tried to depart; but his crews were run down\\nfrom the fevers raging on these unsanitary shores, and quite ill\\nhimself, he was unable to weigh anchor until March 17.\\n\\nMeanwhile, fearing that Dumont d’Urville wasn’t abreast of Dillon’s\\nactivities, the French government sent a sloop of war to Vanikoro, the\\nBayonnaise under Commander Legoarant de Tromelin, who had been\\nstationed on the American west coast. Dropping anchor before Vanikoro\\na few months after the new Astrolabe’s departure, the Bayonnaise\\ndidn’t find any additional evidence but verified that the savages\\nhadn’t disturbed the memorial honoring the Count de La PΘrouse.\\n\\nThis is the substance of the account I gave Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“So,” he said to me, “the castaways built a third ship on Vanikoro\\nIsland, and to this day, nobody knows where it went and perished?”\\n\\n“Nobody knows.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo didn’t reply but signaled me to follow him to the main\\nlounge. The Nautilus sank a few meters beneath the waves, and the\\npanels opened.\\n\\nI rushed to the window and saw crusts of coral: fungus coral,\\nsiphonula coral, alcyon coral, sea anemone from the genus Caryophylia,\\nplus myriads of charming fish including greenfish, damselfish,\\nsweepers, snappers, and squirrelfish; underneath this coral covering I\\ndetected some rubble the old dredges hadn’t been able to tear\\nfree—iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, shells, tackle from a capstan, a\\nstempost, all objects hailing from the wrecked ships and now carpeted\\nin moving flowers.\\n\\nAnd as I stared at this desolate wreckage, Captain Nemo told me in a\\nsolemn voice:\\n\\n“Commander La PΘrouse set out on December 7, 1785, with his ships, the\\nCompass and the Astrolabe. He dropped anchor first at Botany Bay,\\nvisited the Tonga Islands and New Caledonia, headed toward the Santa\\nCruz Islands, and put in at Nomuka, one of the islands in the Ha’apai\\ngroup. Then his ships arrived at the unknown reefs of\\nVanikoro. Traveling in the lead, the Compass ran afoul of breakers on\\nthe southerly coast. The Astrolabe went to its rescue and also ran\\naground. The first ship was destroyed almost immediately. The second,\\nstranded to leeward, held up for some days. The natives gave the\\ncastaways a fair enough welcome. The latter took up residence on the\\nisland and built a smaller craft with rubble from the two large\\nones. A few seamen stayed voluntarily in Vanikoro. The others, weak\\nand ailing, set sail with the Count de La PΘrouse. They headed to the\\nSolomon Islands, and they perished with all hands on the westerly\\ncoast of the chief island in that group, between Cape Deception and\\nCape Satisfaction!”\\n\\n“And how do you know all this?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Here’s what I found at the very site of that final shipwreck!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo showed me a tin box, stamped with the coat of arms of\\nFrance and all corroded by salt water. He opened it and I saw a bundle\\nof papers, yellowed but still legible.\\n\\nThey were the actual military orders given by France’s Minister of the\\nNavy to Commander La PΘrouse, with notes along the margin in the\\nhandwriting of King Louis XVI!\\n\\n“Ah, what a splendid death for a seaman!” Captain Nemo then said. “A\\ncoral grave is a tranquil grave, and may Heaven grant that my\\ncompanions and I rest in no other!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\nThe Torres Strait\\n\\n\\nDURING THE NIGHT of December 27-28, the Nautilus left the waterways of\\nVanikoro behind with extraordinary speed. Its heading was\\nsouthwesterly, and in three days it had cleared the 750 leagues that\\nseparated La PΘrouse’s islands from the southeastern tip of Papua.\\n\\nOn January 1, 1868, bright and early, Conseil joined me on the\\nplatform.\\n\\n“Will master,” the gallant lad said to me, “allow me to wish him a\\nhappy new year?”\\n\\n“Good heavens, Conseil, it’s just like old times in my office at the\\nBotanical Gardens in Paris! I accept your kind wishes and I thank you\\nfor them. Only, I’d like to know what you mean by a ‘happy year’ under\\nthe circumstances in which we’re placed. Is it a year that will bring\\nour imprisonment to an end, or a year that will see this strange\\nvoyage continue?”\\n\\n“Ye gods,” Conseil replied, “I hardly know what to tell master. We’re\\ncertainly seeing some unusual things, and for two months we’ve had no\\ntime for boredom. The latest wonder is always the most astonishing,\\nand if this progression keeps up, I can’t imagine what its climax will\\nbe. In my opinion, we’ll never again have such an opportunity.”\\n\\n“Never, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Besides, Mr. Nemo really lives up to his Latin name, since he\\ncouldn’t be less in the way if he didn’t exist.”\\n\\n“True enough, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Therefore, with all due respect to master, I think a ‘happy year’\\nwould be a year that lets us see everything—”\\n\\n“Everything, Conseil? No year could be that long. But what does Ned\\nLand think about all this?”\\n\\n“Ned Land’s thoughts are exactly the opposite of mine,” Conseil\\nreplied. “He has a practical mind and a demanding stomach. He’s tired\\nof staring at fish and eating them day in and day out. This shortage\\nof wine, bread, and meat isn’t suitable for an upstanding Anglo-Saxon,\\na man accustomed to beefsteak and unfazed by regular doses of brandy\\nor gin!”\\n\\n“For my part, Conseil, that doesn’t bother me in the least, and I’ve\\nadjusted very nicely to the diet on board.”\\n\\n“So have I,” Conseil replied. “Accordingly, I think as much about\\nstaying as Mr. Land about making his escape. Thus, if this new year\\nisn’t a happy one for me, it will be for him, and vice versa. No\\nmatter what happens, one of us will be pleased. So, in conclusion, I\\nwish master to have whatever his heart desires.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Conseil. Only I must ask you to postpone the question of\\nnew year’s gifts, and temporarily accept a hearty handshake in their\\nplace. That’s all I have on me.”\\n\\n“Master has never been more generous,” Conseil replied.\\n\\nAnd with that, the gallant lad went away.\\n\\nBy January 2 we had fared 11,340 miles, hence 5,250 leagues, from our\\nstarting point in the seas of Japan. Before the Nautilus’s spur there\\nstretched the dangerous waterways of the Coral Sea, off the northeast\\ncoast of Australia. Our boat cruised along a few miles away from that\\ndaunting shoal where Captain Cook’s ships wellnigh miscarried on June\\n10, 1770. The craft that Cook was aboard charged into some coral rock,\\nand if his vessel didn’t go down, it was thanks to the circumstance\\nthat a piece of coral broke off in the collision and plugged the very\\nhole it had made in the hull.\\n\\nI would have been deeply interested in visiting this long, 360-league\\nreef, against which the ever-surging sea broke with the fearsome\\nintensity of thunderclaps. But just then the Nautilus’s slanting fins\\ntook us to great depths, and I could see nothing of those high coral\\nwalls. I had to rest content with the various specimens of fish\\nbrought up by our nets. Among others I noted some long-finned\\nalbacore, a species in the genus Scomber, as big as tuna, bluish on\\nthe flanks, and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when\\nthe animal dies. These fish followed us in schools and supplied our\\ntable with very dainty flesh. We also caught a large number of\\nyellow-green gilthead, half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado,\\nplus some flying gurnards, authentic underwater swallows that, on dark\\nnights, alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent\\nglimmers. Among mollusks and zoophytes, I found in our trawl’s meshes\\nvarious species of alcyonarian coral, sea urchins, hammer shells,\\nspurred-star shells, wentletrap snails, horn shells, glass snails. The\\nlocal flora was represented by fine floating algae: sea tangle, and\\nkelp from the genus Macrocystis, saturated with the mucilage their\\npores perspire, from which I selected a wonderful Nemastoma\\ngeliniaroidea, classifying it with the natural curiosities in the\\nmuseum.\\n\\nOn January 4, two days after crossing the Coral Sea, we raised the\\ncoast of Papua. On this occasion Captain Nemo told me that he intended\\nto reach the Indian Ocean via the Torres Strait. This was the extent\\nof his remarks. Ned saw with pleasure that this course would bring us,\\nonce again, closer to European seas.\\n\\nThe Torres Strait is regarded as no less dangerous for its bristling\\nreefs than for the savage inhabitants of its coasts. It separates\\nQueensland from the huge island of Papua, also called New Guinea.\\n\\nPapua is 400 leagues long by 130 leagues wide, with a surface area of\\n40,000 geographic leagues. It’s located between latitude 0 degrees 19’\\nand 10 degrees 2’ south, and between longitude 128 degrees 23’ and 146\\ndegrees 15’. At noon, while the chief officer was taking the sun’s\\naltitude, I spotted the summits of the Arfak Mountains, rising in\\nterraces and ending in sharp peaks.\\n\\nDiscovered in 1511 by the Portuguese Francisco Serrano, these shores\\nwere successively visited by Don Jorge de Meneses in 1526, by Juan de\\nGrijalva in 1527, by the Spanish general Alvaro de Saavedra in 1528,\\nby Inigo Ortiz in 1545, by the Dutchman Schouten in 1616, by Nicolas\\nSruick in 1753, by Tasman, Dampier, Fumel, Carteret, Edwards,\\nBougainville, Cook, McClure, and Thomas Forrest, by Rear Admiral\\nd’Entrecasteaux in 1792, by Louis-Isidore Duperrey in 1823, and by\\nCaptain Dumont d’Urville in 1827. “It’s the heartland of the blacks\\nwho occupy all Malaysia,” Mr. de Rienzi has said; and I hadn’t the\\nfoggiest inkling that sailors’ luck was about to bring me face to face\\nwith these daunting Andaman aborigines.\\n\\nSo the Nautilus hove before the entrance to the world’s most dangerous\\nstrait, a passageway that even the boldest navigators hesitated to\\nclear: the strait that Luis Vaez de Torres faced on returning from the\\nSouth Seas in Melanesia, the strait in which sloops of war under\\nCaptain Dumont d’Urville ran aground in 1840 and nearly miscarried\\nwith all hands. And even the Nautilus, rising superior to every danger\\nin the sea, was about to become intimate with its coral reefs.\\n\\nThe Torres Strait is about thirty-four leagues wide, but it’s\\nobstructed by an incalculable number of islands, islets, breakers, and\\nrocks that make it nearly impossible to navigate. Consequently,\\nCaptain Nemo took every desired precaution in crossing it. Floating\\nflush with the water, the Nautilus moved ahead at a moderate\\npace. Like a cetacean’s tail, its propeller churned the waves slowly.\\n\\nTaking advantage of this situation, my two companions and I found\\nseats on the ever-deserted platform. In front of us stood the\\npilothouse, and unless I’m extremely mistaken, Captain Nemo must have\\nbeen inside, steering his Nautilus himself.\\n\\nUnder my eyes I had the excellent charts of the Torres Strait that had\\nbeen surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer Vincendon\\nDumoulin and Sublieutenant (now Admiral) Coupvent-Desbois, who were\\npart of Dumont d’Urville’s general staff during his final voyage to\\ncircumnavigate the globe. These, along with the efforts of Captain\\nKing, are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this narrow\\npassageway, and I consulted them with scrupulous care.\\n\\nAround the Nautilus the sea was boiling furiously. A stream of waves,\\nbearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half miles\\nper hour, broke over heads of coral emerging here and there.\\n\\n“That’s one rough sea!” Ned Land told me.\\n\\n“Abominable indeed,” I replied, “and hardly suitable for a craft like\\nthe Nautilus.”\\n\\n“That damned captain,” the Canadian went on, “must really be sure of\\nhis course, because if these clumps of coral so much as brush us,\\nthey’ll rip our hull into a thousand pieces!”\\n\\nThe situation was indeed dangerous, but as if by magic, the Nautilus\\nseemed to glide right down the middle of these rampaging reefs. It\\ndidn’t follow the exact course of the Zealous and the new Astrolabe,\\nwhich had proved so ill-fated for Captain Dumont d’Urville. It went\\nmore to the north, hugged the Murray Islands, and returned to the\\nsouthwest near Cumberland Passage. I thought it was about to charge\\nwholeheartedly into this opening, but it went up to the northwest,\\nthrough a large number of little-known islands and islets, and steered\\ntoward Tound Island and the Bad Channel.\\n\\nI was already wondering if Captain Nemo, rash to the point of sheer\\ninsanity, wanted his ship to tackle the narrows where Dumont\\nd’Urville’s two sloops of war had gone aground, when he changed\\ndirection a second time and cut straight to the west, heading toward\\nGueboroa Island.\\n\\nBy then it was three o’clock in the afternoon. The current was\\nslacking off, it was almost full tide. The Nautilus drew near this\\nisland, which I can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of\\nscrew pines. We hugged it from less than two miles out.\\n\\nA sudden jolt threw me down. The Nautilus had just struck a reef, and\\nit remained motionless, listing slightly to port.\\n\\nWhen I stood up, I saw Captain Nemo and his chief officer on the\\nplatform. They were examining the ship’s circumstances, exchanging a\\nfew words in their incomprehensible dialect.\\n\\nHere is what those circumstances entailed. Two miles to starboard lay\\nGueboroa Island, its coastline curving north to west like an immense\\narm. To the south and east, heads of coral were already on display,\\nleft uncovered by the ebbing waters. We had run aground at full tide\\nand in one of those seas whose tides are moderate, an inconvenient\\nstate of affairs for floating the Nautilus off. However, the ship\\nhadn’t suffered in any way, so solidly joined was its hull. But\\nalthough it could neither sink nor split open, it was in serious\\ndanger of being permanently attached to these reefs, and that would\\nhave been the finish of Captain Nemo’s submersible.\\n\\nI was mulling this over when the captain approached, cool and calm,\\nforever in control of himself, looking neither alarmed nor annoyed.\\n\\n“An accident?” I said to him.\\n\\n“No, an incident,” he answered me.\\n\\n“But an incident,” I replied, “that may oblige you to become a\\nresident again of these shores you avoid!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo gave me an odd look and gestured no. Which told me pretty\\nclearly that nothing would ever force him to set foot on a land mass\\nagain. Then he said:\\n\\n“No, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus isn’t consigned to perdition. It\\nwill still carry you through the midst of the ocean’s wonders. Our\\nvoyage is just beginning, and I’ve no desire to deprive myself so soon\\nof the pleasure of your company.”\\n\\n“Even so, Captain Nemo,” I went on, ignoring his ironic turn of\\nphrase, “the Nautilus has run aground at a moment when the sea is\\nfull. Now then, the tides aren’t strong in the Pacific, and if you\\ncan’t unballast the Nautilus, which seems impossible to me, I don’t\\nsee how it will float off.”\\n\\n“You’re right, professor, the Pacific tides aren’t strong,” Captain\\nNemo replied. “But in the Torres Strait, one still finds a\\nmeter-and-a-half difference in level between high and low seas. Today\\nis January 4, and in five days the moon will be full. Now then, I’ll\\nbe quite astonished if that good-natured satellite doesn’t\\nsufficiently raise these masses of water and do me a favor for which\\nI’ll be forever grateful.”\\n\\nThis said, Captain Nemo went below again to the Nautilus’s interior,\\nfollowed by his chief officer. As for our craft, it no longer stirred,\\nstaying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled it\\nin with their indestructible cement.\\n\\n“Well, sir?” Ned Land said to me, coming up after the captain’s\\ndeparture.\\n\\n“Well, Ned my friend, we’ll serenely wait for the tide on the 9th,\\nbecause it seems the moon will have the good nature to float us away!”\\n\\n“As simple as that?”\\n\\n“As simple as that.”\\n\\n“So our captain isn’t going to drop his anchors, put his engines on\\nthe chains, and do anything to haul us off?”\\n\\n“Since the tide will be sufficient,” Conseil replied simply.\\n\\nThe Canadian stared at Conseil, then he shrugged his shoulders. The\\nseaman in him was talking now.\\n\\n“Sir,” he answered, “you can trust me when I say this hunk of iron\\nwill never navigate again, on the seas or under them. It’s only fit to\\nbe sold for its weight. So I think it’s time we gave Captain Nemo the\\nslip.”\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” I replied, “unlike you, I haven’t given up on our\\nvaliant Nautilus, and in four days we’ll know where we stand on these\\nPacific tides. Besides, an escape attempt might be timely if we were\\nin sight of the coasts of England or Provence, but in the waterways of\\nPapua it’s another story. And we’ll always have that as a last resort\\nif the Nautilus doesn’t right itself, which I’d regard as a real\\ncalamity.”\\n\\n“But couldn’t we at least get the lay of the land?” Ned went\\non. “Here’s an island. On this island there are trees. Under those\\ntrees land animals loaded with cutlets and roast beef, which I’d be\\nhappy to sink my teeth into.”\\n\\n“In this instance our friend Ned is right,” Conseil said, “and I side\\nwith his views. Couldn’t master persuade his friend Captain Nemo to\\nsend the three of us ashore, if only so our feet don’t lose the knack\\nof treading on the solid parts of our planet?”\\n\\n“I can ask him,” I replied, “but he’ll refuse.”\\n\\n“Let master take the risk,” Conseil said, “and we’ll know where we\\nstand on the captain’s affability.”\\n\\nMuch to my surprise, Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for,\\nand he did so with grace and alacrity, not even exacting my promise to\\nreturn on board. But fleeing across the New Guinea territories would\\nbe extremely dangerous, and I wouldn’t have advised Ned Land to try\\nit. Better to be prisoners aboard the Nautilus than to fall into the\\nhands of Papuan natives.\\n\\nThe skiff was put at our disposal for the next morning. I hardly\\nneeded to ask whether Captain Nemo would be coming along. I likewise\\nassumed that no crewmen would be assigned to us, that Ned Land would\\nbe in sole charge of piloting the longboat. Besides, the shore lay no\\nmore than two miles off, and it would be child’s play for the Canadian\\nto guide that nimble skiff through those rows of reefs so ill-fated\\nfor big ships.\\n\\nThe next day, January 5, after its deck paneling was opened, the skiff\\nwas wrenched from its socket and launched to sea from the top of the\\nplatform. Two men were sufficient for this operation. The oars were\\ninside the longboat and we had only to take our seats.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock, armed with rifles and axes, we pulled clear of the\\nNautilus. The sea was fairly calm. A mild breeze blew from shore. In\\nplace by the oars, Conseil and I rowed vigorously, and Ned steered us\\ninto the narrow lanes between the breakers. The skiff handled easily\\nand sped swiftly.\\n\\nNed Land couldn’t conceal his glee. He was a prisoner escaping from\\nprison and never dreaming he would need to reenter it.\\n\\n“Meat!” he kept repeating. “Now we’ll eat red meat! Actual game! A\\nreal mess call, by thunder! I’m not saying fish aren’t good for you,\\nbut we mustn’t overdo ‘em, and a slice of fresh venison grilled over\\nlive coals will be a nice change from our standard fare.”\\n\\n“You glutton,” Conseil replied, “you’re making my mouth water!”\\n\\n“It remains to be seen,” I said, “whether these forests do contain\\ngame, and if the types of game aren’t of such size that they can hunt\\nthe hunter.”\\n\\n“Fine, Professor Aronnax!” replied the Canadian, whose teeth seemed to\\nbe as honed as the edge of an ax. “But if there’s no other quadruped\\non this island, I’ll eat tiger—tiger sirloin.”\\n\\n“Our friend Ned grows disturbing,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Whatever it is,” Ned Land went on, “any animal having four feet\\nwithout feathers, or two feet with feathers, will be greeted by my\\nvery own one-gun salute.”\\n\\n“Oh good!” I replied. “The reckless Mr. Land is at it again!”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, Professor Aronnax, just keep rowing!” the Canadian\\nreplied. “I only need twenty-five minutes to serve you one of my own\\nspecial creations.”\\n\\nBy 8:30 the Nautilus’s skiff had just run gently aground on a sandy\\nstrand, after successfully clearing the ring of coral that surrounds\\nGueboroa Island.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\nSome Days Ashore\\n\\n\\nSTEPPING ASHORE had an exhilarating effect on me. Ned Land tested the\\nsoil with his foot, as if he were laying claim to it. Yet it had been\\nonly two months since we had become, as Captain Nemo expressed it,\\n“passengers on the Nautilus,” in other words, the literal prisoners of\\nits commander.\\n\\nIn a few minutes we were a gunshot away from the coast. The soil was\\nalmost entirely madreporic, but certain dry stream beds were strewn\\nwith granite rubble, proving that this island was of primordial\\norigin. The entire horizon was hidden behind a curtain of wonderful\\nforests. Enormous trees, sometimes as high as 200 feet, were linked to\\neach other by garlands of tropical creepers, genuine natural hammocks\\nthat swayed in a mild breeze. There were mimosas, banyan trees,\\nbeefwood, teakwood, hibiscus, screw pines, palm trees, all mingling in\\nwild profusion; and beneath the shade of their green canopies, at the\\nfeet of their gigantic trunks, there grew orchids, leguminous plants,\\nand ferns.\\n\\nMeanwhile, ignoring all these fine specimens of Papuan flora, the\\nCanadian passed up the decorative in favor of the functional. He\\nspotted a coconut palm, beat down some of its fruit, broke them open,\\nand we drank their milk and ate their meat with a pleasure that was a\\nprotest against our standard fare on the Nautilus.\\n\\n“Excellent!” Ned Land said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exquisite!” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“And I don’t think,” the Canadian said, “that your Nemo would object\\nto us stashing a cargo of coconuts aboard his vessel?”\\n\\n“I imagine not,” I replied, “but he won’t want to sample them.”\\n\\n“Too bad for him!” Conseil said.\\n\\n“And plenty good for us!” Ned Land shot back. “There’ll be more left\\nover!”\\n\\n“A word of caution, Mr. Land,” I told the harpooner, who was about to\\nravage another coconut palm. “Coconuts are admirable things, but\\nbefore we stuff the skiff with them, it would be wise to find out\\nwhether this island offers other substances just as useful. Some fresh\\nvegetables would be well received in the Nautilus’s pantry.”\\n\\n“Master is right,” Conseil replied, “and I propose that we set aside\\nthree places in our longboat: one for fruit, another for vegetables,\\nand a third for venison, of which I still haven’t glimpsed the tiniest\\nspecimen.”\\n\\n“Don’t give up so easily, Conseil,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“So let’s continue our excursion,” I went on, “but keep a sharp\\nlookout. This island seems uninhabited, but it still might harbor\\ncertain individuals who aren’t so finicky about the sort of game they\\neat!”\\n\\n“Hee hee!” Ned put in, with a meaningful movement of his jaws.\\n\\n“Ned! Oh horrors!” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“Ye gods,” the Canadian shot back, “I’m starting to appreciate the\\ncharms of cannibalism!”\\n\\n“Ned, Ned! Don’t say that!” Conseil answered. “You a cannibal? Why,\\nI’ll no longer be safe next to you, I who share your cabin! Does this\\nmean I’ll wake up half devoured one fine day?”\\n\\n“I’m awfully fond of you, Conseil my friend, but not enough to eat you\\nwhen there’s better food around.”\\n\\n“Then I daren’t delay,” Conseil replied. “The hunt is on! We\\nabsolutely must bag some game to placate this man-eater, or one of\\nthese mornings master won’t find enough pieces of his manservant to\\nserve him.”\\n\\nWhile exchanging this chitchat, we entered beneath the dark canopies\\nof the forest, and for two hours we explored it in every direction.\\n\\nWe couldn’t have been luckier in our search for edible vegetation, and\\nsome of the most useful produce in the tropical zones supplied us with\\na valuable foodstuff missing on board.\\n\\nI mean the breadfruit tree, which is quite abundant on Gueboroa\\nIsland, and there I chiefly noted the seedless variety that in\\nMalaysia is called “rima.”\\n\\nThis tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty\\nfeet high. To the naturalist’s eye, its gracefully rounded crown,\\nformed of big multilobed leaves, was enough to denote the artocarpus\\nthat has been so successfully transplanted to the Mascarene Islands\\neast of\\n\\nMadagascar. From its mass of greenery, huge globular fruit stood out,\\na decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that\\nassumed a hexangular pattern. It’s a handy plant that nature gives to\\nregions lacking in wheat; without needing to be cultivated, it bears\\nfruit eight months out of the year.\\n\\nNed Land was on familiar terms with this fruit. He had already eaten\\nit on his many voyages and knew how to cook its edible substance. So\\nthe very sight of it aroused his appetite, and he couldn’t control\\nhimself.\\n\\n“Sir,” he told me, “I’ll die if I don’t sample a little breadfruit\\npasta!”\\n\\n“Sample some, Ned my friend, sample all you like. We’re here to\\nconduct experiments, let’s conduct them.”\\n\\n“It won’t take a minute,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\nEquipped with a magnifying glass, he lit a fire of deadwood that was\\nsoon crackling merrily. Meanwhile Conseil and I selected the finest\\nartocarpus fruit. Some still weren’t ripe enough, and their thick\\nskins covered white, slightly fibrous pulps. But a great many others\\nwere yellowish and gelatinous, just begging to be picked.\\n\\nThis fruit contained no pits. Conseil brought a dozen of them to Ned\\nLand, who cut them into thick slices and placed them over a fire of\\nlive coals, all the while repeating:\\n\\n“You’ll see, sir, how tasty this bread is!”\\n\\n“Especially since we’ve gone without baked goods for so long,” Conseil\\nsaid.\\n\\n“It’s more than just bread,” the Canadian added. “It’s a dainty\\npastry. You’ve never eaten any, sir?”\\n\\n“No, Ned.”\\n\\n“All right, get ready for something downright delectable! If you don’t\\ncome back for seconds, I’m no longer the King of Harpooners!”\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, the parts of the fruit exposed to the fire were\\ncompletely toasted. On the inside there appeared some white pasta, a\\nsort of soft bread center whose flavor reminded me of artichoke.\\n\\nThis bread was excellent, I must admit, and I ate it with great\\npleasure.\\n\\n“Unfortunately,” I said, “this pasta won’t stay fresh, so it seems\\npointless to make a supply for on board.”\\n\\n“By thunder, sir!” Ned Land exclaimed. “There you go, talking like a\\nnaturalist, but meantime I’ll be acting like a baker! Conseil, harvest\\nsome of this fruit to take with us when we go back.”\\n\\n“And how will you prepare it?” I asked the Canadian.\\n\\n“I’ll make a fermented batter from its pulp that’ll keep indefinitely\\nwithout spoiling. When I want some, I’ll just cook it in the galley on\\nboard—it’ll have a slightly tart flavor, but you’ll find it\\nexcellent.”\\n\\n“So, Mr. Ned, I see that this bread is all we need—”\\n\\n“Not quite, professor,” the Canadian replied. “We need some fruit to\\ngo with it, or at least some vegetables.”\\n\\n“Then let’s look for fruit and vegetables.”\\n\\nWhen our breadfruit harvesting was done, we took to the trail to\\ncomplete this “dry-land dinner.”\\n\\nWe didn’t search in vain, and near noontime we had an ample supply of\\nbananas. This delicious produce from the Torrid Zones ripens all year\\nround, and Malaysians, who give them the name “pisang,” eat them\\nwithout bothering to cook them. In addition to bananas, we gathered\\nsome enormous jackfruit with a very tangy flavor, some tasty mangoes,\\nand some pineapples of unbelievable size. But this foraging took up a\\ngood deal of our time, which, even so, we had no cause to regret.\\n\\nConseil kept Ned under observation. The harpooner walked in the lead,\\nand during his stroll through this forest, he gathered with sure hands\\nsome excellent fruit that should have completed his provisions.\\n\\n“So,” Conseil asked, “you have everything you need, Ned my friend?”\\n\\n“Humph!” the Canadian put in.\\n\\n“What! You’re complaining?”\\n\\n“All this vegetation doesn’t make a meal,” Ned replied. “Just side\\ndishes, dessert. But where’s the soup course? Where’s the roast?”\\n\\n“Right,” I said. “Ned promised us cutlets, which seems highly\\nquestionable to me.”\\n\\n“Sir,” the Canadian replied, “our hunting not only isn’t over, it\\nhasn’t even started. Patience! We’re sure to end up bumping into some\\nanimal with either feathers or fur, if not in this locality, then in\\nanother.”\\n\\n“And if not today, then tomorrow, because we mustn’t wander too far\\noff,” Conseil added. “That’s why I propose that we return to the\\nskiff.”\\n\\n“What! Already!” Ned exclaimed.\\n\\n“We ought to be back before nightfall,” I said.\\n\\n“But what hour is it, then?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“Two o’clock at least,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“How time flies on solid ground!” exclaimed Mr. Ned Land with a sigh\\nof regret.\\n\\n“Off we go!” Conseil replied.\\n\\nSo we returned through the forest, and we completed our harvest by\\nmaking a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked from\\nthe crowns of their trees, some small beans that I recognized as the\\n“abrou” of the Malaysians, and some high-quality yams.\\n\\nWe were overloaded when we arrived at the skiff. However, Ned Land\\nstill found these provisions inadequate. But fortune smiled on\\nhim. Just as we were boarding, he spotted several trees twenty-five to\\nthirty feet high, belonging to the palm species. As valuable as the\\nartocarpus, these trees are justly ranked among the most useful\\nproduce in Malaysia.\\n\\nThey were sago palms, vegetation that grows without being cultivated;\\nlike mulberry trees, they reproduce by means of shoots and seeds.\\n\\nNed Land knew how to handle these trees. Taking his ax and wielding it\\nwith great vigor, he soon stretched out on the ground two or three\\nsago palms, whose maturity was revealed by the white dust sprinkled\\nover their palm fronds.\\n\\nI watched him more as a naturalist than as a man in hunger. He began\\nby removing from each trunk an inch-thick strip of bark that covered a\\nnetwork of long, hopelessly tangled fibers that were puttied with a\\nsort of gummy flour. This flour was the starch-like sago, an edible\\nsubstance chiefly consumed by the Melanesian peoples.\\n\\nFor the time being, Ned Land was content to chop these trunks into\\npieces, as if he were making firewood; later he would extract the\\nflour by sifting it through cloth to separate it from its fibrous\\nligaments, let it dry out in the sun, and leave it to harden inside\\nmolds.\\n\\nFinally, at five o’clock in the afternoon, laden with all our\\ntreasures, we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled\\nalongside the Nautilus. Nobody appeared on our arrival. The enormous\\nsheet-iron cylinder seemed deserted. Our provisions loaded on board, I\\nwent below to my stateroom. There I found my supper ready. I ate and\\nthen fell asleep.\\n\\nThe next day, January 6: nothing new on board. Not a sound inside, not\\na sign of life. The skiff stayed alongside in the same place we had\\nleft it. We decided to return to Gueboroa Island. Ned Land hoped for\\nbetter luck in his hunting than on the day before, and he wanted to\\nvisit a different part of the forest.\\n\\nBy sunrise we were off. Carried by an inbound current, the longboat\\nreached the island in a matter of moments.\\n\\nWe disembarked, and thinking it best to abide by the Canadian’s\\ninstincts, we followed Ned Land, whose long legs threatened to outpace\\nus.\\n\\nNed Land went westward up the coast; then, fording some stream beds,\\nhe reached open plains that were bordered by wonderful forests. Some\\nkingfishers lurked along the watercourses, but they didn’t let us\\napproach. Their cautious behavior proved to me that these winged\\ncreatures knew where they stood on bipeds of our species, and I\\nconcluded that if this island wasn’t inhabited, at least human beings\\npaid it frequent visits.\\n\\nAfter crossing a pretty lush prairie, we arrived on the outskirts of a\\nsmall wood, enlivened by the singing and soaring of a large number of\\nbirds.\\n\\n“Still, they’re merely birds,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“But some are edible,” the harpooner replied.\\n\\n“Wrong, Ned my friend,” Conseil answered, “because I see only ordinary\\nparrots here.”\\n\\n“Conseil my friend,” Ned replied in all seriousness, “parrots are like\\npheasant to people with nothing else on their plates.”\\n\\n“And I might add,” I said, “that when these birds are properly cooked,\\nthey’re at least worth a stab of the fork.”\\n\\nIndeed, under the dense foliage of this wood, a whole host of parrots\\nfluttered from branch to branch, needing only the proper upbringing to\\nspeak human dialects. At present they were cackling in chorus with\\nparakeets of every color, with solemn cockatoos that seemed to be\\npondering some philosophical problem, while bright red lories passed\\nby like pieces of bunting borne on the breeze, in the midst of kalao\\nparrots raucously on the wing, Papuan lories painted the subtlest\\nshades of azure, and a whole variety of delightful winged creatures,\\nnone terribly edible.\\n\\nHowever, one bird unique to these shores, which never passes beyond\\nthe boundaries of the Aru and Papuan Islands, was missing from this\\ncollection. But I was given a chance to marvel at it soon enough.\\n\\nAfter crossing through a moderately dense thicket, we again found some\\nplains obstructed by bushes. There I saw some magnificent birds\\nsoaring aloft, the arrangement of their long feathers causing them to\\nhead into the wind. Their undulating flight, the grace of their aerial\\ncurves, and the play of their colors allured and delighted the eye. I\\nhad no trouble identifying them.\\n\\n“Birds of paradise!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Order Passeriforma, division Clystomora,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Partridge family?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\n“I doubt it, Mr. Land. Nevertheless, I’m counting on your dexterity to\\ncatch me one of these delightful representatives of tropical nature!”\\n\\n“I’ll give it a try, professor, though I’m handier with a harpoon than\\na rifle.”\\n\\nMalaysians, who do a booming business in these birds with the Chinese,\\nhave various methods for catching them that we couldn’t use. Sometimes\\nthey set snares on the tops of the tall trees that the bird of\\nparadise prefers to inhabit. At other times they capture it with a\\ntenacious glue that paralyzes its movements. They will even go so far\\nas to poison the springs where these fowl habitually drink. But in our\\ncase, all we could do was fire at them on the wing, which left us\\nlittle chance of getting one. And in truth, we used up a good part of\\nour ammunition in vain.\\n\\nNear eleven o’clock in the morning, we cleared the lower slopes of the\\nmountains that form the island’s center, and we still hadn’t bagged a\\nthing. Hunger spurred us on. The hunters had counted on consuming the\\nproceeds of their hunting, and they had miscalculated. Luckily, and\\nmuch to his surprise, Conseil pulled off a right-and-left shot and\\ninsured our breakfast. He brought down a white pigeon and a ringdove,\\nwhich were briskly plucked, hung from a spit, and roasted over a\\nblazing fire of deadwood. While these fascinating animals were\\ncooking, Ned prepared some bread from the artocarpus. Then the pigeon\\nand ringdove were devoured to the bones and declared\\nexcellent. Nutmeg, on which these birds habitually gorge themselves,\\nsweetens their flesh and makes it delicious eating.\\n\\n“They taste like chicken stuffed with truffles,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“All right, Ned,” I asked the Canadian, “now what do you need?”\\n\\n“Game with four paws, Professor Aronnax,” Ned Land replied. “All these\\npigeons are only appetizers, snacks. So till I’ve bagged an animal\\nwith cutlets, I won’t be happy!”\\n\\n“Nor I, Ned, until I’ve caught a bird of paradise.”\\n\\n“Then let’s keep hunting,” Conseil replied, “but while heading back to\\nthe sea. We’ve arrived at the foothills of these mountains, and I\\nthink we’ll do better if we return to the forest regions.”\\n\\nIt was good advice and we took it. After an hour’s walk we reached a\\ngenuine sago palm forest. A few harmless snakes fled underfoot. Birds\\nof paradise stole off at our approach, and I was in real despair of\\ncatching one when Conseil, walking in the lead, stooped suddenly, gave\\na triumphant shout, and came back to me, carrying a magnificent bird\\nof paradise.\\n\\n“Oh bravo, Conseil!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Master is too kind,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Not at all, my boy. That was a stroke of genius, catching one of\\nthese live birds with your bare hands!”\\n\\n“If master will examine it closely, he’ll see that I deserve no great\\npraise.”\\n\\n“And why not, Conseil?”\\n\\n“Because this bird is as drunk as a lord.”\\n\\n“Drunk?”\\n\\n“Yes, master, drunk from the nutmegs it was devouring under that\\nnutmeg tree where I caught it. See, Ned my friend, see the monstrous\\nresults of intemperance!”\\n\\n“Damnation!” the Canadian shot back. “Considering the amount of gin\\nI’ve had these past two months, you’ve got nothing to complain about!”\\n\\nMeanwhile I was examining this unusual bird. Conseil was not\\nmistaken. Tipsy from that potent juice, our bird of paradise had been\\nreduced to helplessness. It was unable to fly. It was barely able to\\nwalk. But this didn’t alarm me, and I just let it sleep off its\\nnutmeg.\\n\\nThis bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited to\\nPapua and its neighboring islands. It was a “great emerald,” one of\\nthe rarest birds of paradise. It measured three decimeters long. Its\\nhead was comparatively small, and its eyes, placed near the opening of\\nits beak, were also small. But it offered a wonderful mixture of hues:\\na yellow beak, brown feet and claws, hazel wings with purple tips,\\npale yellow head and scruff of the neck, emerald throat, the belly and\\nchest maroon to brown. Two strands, made of a horn substance covered\\nwith down, rose over its tail, which was lengthened by long, very\\nlight feathers of wonderful fineness, and they completed the costume\\nof this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically named “the\\nsun bird.”\\n\\nHow I wished I could take this superb bird of paradise back to Paris,\\nto make a gift of it to the zoo at the Botanical Gardens, which\\ndoesn’t own a single live specimen.\\n\\n“So it must be a rarity or something?” the Canadian asked, in the tone\\nof a hunter who, from the viewpoint of his art, gives the game a\\npretty low rating.\\n\\n“A great rarity, my gallant comrade, and above all very hard to\\ncapture alive. And even after they’re dead, there’s still a major\\nmarket for these birds. So the natives have figured out how to create\\nfake ones, like people create fake pearls or diamonds.”\\n\\n“What!” Conseil exclaimed. “They make counterfeit birds of paradise?”\\n\\n“Yes, Conseil.”\\n\\n“And is master familiar with how the islanders go about it?”\\n\\n“Perfectly familiar. During the easterly monsoon season, birds of\\nparadise lose the magnificent feathers around their tails that\\nnaturalists call ‘below-the-wing’ feathers. These feathers are\\ngathered by the fowl forgers and skillfully fitted onto some poor\\npreviously mutilated parakeet. Then they paint over the suture,\\nvarnish the bird, and ship the fruits of their unique labors to\\nmuseums and collectors in Europe.”\\n\\n“Good enough!” Ned Land put in. “If it isn’t the right bird, it’s\\nstill the right feathers, and so long as the merchandise isn’t meant\\nto be eaten, I see no great harm!”\\n\\nBut if my desires were fulfilled by the capture of this bird of\\nparadise, those of our Canadian huntsman remained\\nunsatisfied. Luckily, near two o’clock Ned Land brought down a\\nmagnificent wild pig of the type the natives call “bari-outang.” This\\nanimal came in the nick of time for us to bag some real quadruped\\nmeat, and it was warmly welcomed. Ned Land proved himself quite\\ngloriously with his gunshot. Hit by an electric bullet, the pig\\ndropped dead on the spot.\\n\\nThe Canadian properly skinned and cleaned it, after removing half a\\ndozen cutlets destined to serve as the grilled meat course of our\\nevening meal. Then the hunt was on again, and once more would be\\nmarked by the exploits of Ned and Conseil.\\n\\nIn essence, beating the bushes, the two friends flushed a herd of\\nkangaroos that fled by bounding away on their elastic paws. But these\\nanimals didn’t flee so swiftly that our electric capsules couldn’t\\ncatch up with them.\\n\\n“Oh, professor!” shouted Ned Land, whose hunting fever had gone to his\\nbrain. “What excellent game, especially in a stew! What a supply for\\nthe Nautilus! Two, three, five down! And just think how we’ll devour\\nall this meat ourselves, while those numbskulls on board won’t get a\\nshred!”\\n\\nIn his uncontrollable glee, I think the Canadian might have\\nslaughtered the whole horde, if he hadn’t been so busy talking! But he\\nwas content with a dozen of these fascinating marsupials, which make\\nup the first order of aplacental mammals, as Conseil just had to tell\\nus.\\n\\nThese animals were small in stature. They were a species of those\\n“rabbit kangaroos” that usually dwell in the hollows of trees and are\\ntremendously fast; but although of moderate dimensions, they at least\\nfurnish a meat that’s highly prized.\\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with the results of our hunting. A\\ngleeful Ned proposed that we return the next day to this magic island,\\nwhich he planned to depopulate of its every edible quadruped. But he\\nwas reckoning without events.\\n\\nBy six o’clock in the evening, we were back on the beach. The skiff\\nwas aground in its usual place. The Nautilus, looking like a long\\nreef, emerged from the waves two miles offshore.\\n\\nWithout further ado, Ned Land got down to the important business of\\ndinner. He came wonderfully to terms with its entire cooking. Grilling\\nover the coals, those cutlets from the “bari-outang” soon gave off a\\nsucculent aroma that perfumed the air.\\n\\nBut I catch myself following in the Canadian’s footsteps. Look at\\nme—in ecstasy over freshly grilled pork! Please grant me a pardon as\\nI’ve already granted one to Mr. Land, and on the same grounds!\\n\\nIn short, dinner was excellent. Two ringdoves rounded out this\\nextraordinary menu. Sago pasta, bread from the artocarpus, mangoes,\\nhalf a dozen pineapples, and the fermented liquor from certain\\ncoconuts heightened our glee. I suspect that my two fine companions\\nweren’t quite as clearheaded as one could wish.\\n\\n“What if we don’t return to the Nautilus this evening?” Conseil said.\\n\\n“What if we never return to it?” Ned Land added.\\n\\nJust then a stone whizzed toward us, landed at our feet, and cut short\\nthe harpooner’s proposition.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\nThe Lightning Bolts of Captain Nemo\\n\\n\\nWITHOUT STANDING UP, we stared in the direction of the forest, my hand\\nstopping halfway to my mouth, Ned Land’s completing its assignment.\\n\\n“Stones don’t fall from the sky,” Conseil said, “or else they deserve\\nto be called meteorites.”\\n\\nA second well-polished stone removed a tasty ringdove leg from\\nConseil’s hand, giving still greater relevance to his observation.\\n\\nWe all three stood up, rifles to our shoulders, ready to answer any\\nattack.\\n\\n“Apes maybe?” Ned Land exclaimed.\\n\\n“Nearly,” Conseil replied. “Savages.”\\n\\n“Head for the skiff!” I said, moving toward the sea.\\n\\nIndeed, it was essential to beat a retreat because some twenty\\nnatives, armed with bows and slings, appeared barely a hundred paces\\noff, on the outskirts of a thicket that masked the horizon to our\\nright.\\n\\nThe skiff was aground ten fathoms away from us.\\n\\nThe savages approached without running, but they favored us with a\\nshow of the greatest hostility. It was raining stones and arrows.\\n\\nNed Land was unwilling to leave his provisions behind, and despite the\\nimpending danger, he clutched his pig on one side, his kangaroos on\\nthe other, and scampered off with respectable speed.\\n\\nIn two minutes we were on the strand. Loading provisions and weapons\\ninto the skiff, pushing it to sea, and positioning its two oars were\\nthe work of an instant. We hadn’t gone two cable lengths when a\\nhundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water up to\\ntheir waists. I looked to see if their appearance might draw some of\\nthe Nautilus’s men onto the platform. But no. Lying well out, that\\nenormous machine still seemed completely deserted.\\n\\nTwenty minutes later we boarded ship. The hatches were open. After\\nmooring the skiff, we reentered the Nautilus’s interior.\\n\\nI went below to the lounge, from which some chords were\\nwafting. Captain Nemo was there, leaning over the organ, deep in a\\nmusical trance.\\n\\n“Captain!” I said to him.\\n\\nHe didn’t hear me.\\n\\n“Captain!” I went on, touching him with my hand.\\n\\nHe trembled, and turning around:\\n\\n“Ah, it’s you, professor!” he said to me. “Well, did you have a happy\\nhunt? Was your herb gathering a success?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain,” I replied, “but unfortunately we’ve brought back a\\nhorde of bipeds whose proximity worries me.”\\n\\n“What sort of bipeds?”\\n\\n“Savages.”\\n\\n“Savages!” Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone. “You set foot on\\none of the shores of this globe, professor, and you’re surprised to\\nfind savages there? Where aren’t there savages? And besides, are they\\nany worse than men elsewhere, these people you call savages?”\\n\\n“But captain—”\\n\\n“Speaking for myself, sir, I’ve encountered them everywhere.”\\n\\n“Well then,” I replied, “if you don’t want to welcome them aboard the\\nNautilus, you’d better take some precautions!”\\n\\n“Easy, professor, no cause for alarm.”\\n\\n“But there are a large number of these natives.”\\n\\n“What’s your count?”\\n\\n“At least a hundred.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, whose fingers took their\\nplaces again on the organ keys, “if every islander in Papua were to\\ngather on that beach, the Nautilus would still have nothing to fear\\nfrom their attacks!”\\n\\nThe captain’s fingers then ran over the instrument’s keyboard, and I\\nnoticed that he touched only its black keys, which gave his melodies a\\nbasically Scottish color. Soon he had forgotten my presence and was\\nlost in a reverie that I no longer tried to dispel.\\n\\nI climbed onto the platform. Night had already fallen, because in this\\nlow latitude the sun sets quickly, without any twilight. I could see\\nGueboroa Island only dimly. But numerous fires had been kindled on the\\nbeach, attesting that the natives had no thoughts of leaving it.\\n\\nFor several hours I was left to myself, sometimes musing on the\\nislanders—but no longer fearing them because the captain’s unflappable\\nconfidence had won me over—and sometimes forgetting them to marvel at\\nthe splendors of this tropical night. My memories took wing toward\\nFrance, in the wake of those zodiacal stars due to twinkle over it in\\na few hours. The moon shone in the midst of the constellations at\\ntheir zenith. I then remembered that this loyal, good-natured\\nsatellite would return to this same place the day after tomorrow, to\\nraise the tide and tear the Nautilus from its coral bed. Near\\nmidnight, seeing that all was quiet over the darkened waves as well as\\nunder the waterside trees, I repaired to my cabin and fell into a\\npeaceful sleep.\\n\\nThe night passed without mishap. No doubt the Papuans had been\\nfrightened off by the mere sight of this monster aground in the bay,\\nbecause our hatches stayed open, offering easy access to the\\nNautilus’s interior.\\n\\nAt six o’clock in the morning, January 8, I climbed onto the\\nplatform. The morning shadows were lifting. The island was soon on\\nview through the dissolving mists, first its beaches, then its\\nsummits.\\n\\nThe islanders were still there, in greater numbers than on the day\\nbefore, perhaps 500 or 600 of them. Taking advantage of the low tide,\\nsome of them had moved forward over the heads of coral to within two\\ncable lengths of the Nautilus. I could easily distinguish them. They\\nobviously were true Papuans, men of fine stock, athletic in build,\\nforehead high and broad, nose large but not flat, teeth white. Their\\nwoolly, red-tinted hair was in sharp contrast to their bodies, which\\nwere black and glistening like those of Nubians. Beneath their\\npierced, distended earlobes there dangled strings of beads made from\\nbone. Generally these savages were naked. I noted some women among\\nthem, dressed from hip to knee in grass skirts held up by belts made\\nof vegetation. Some of the chieftains adorned their necks with\\ncrescents and with necklaces made from beads of red and white\\nglass. Armed with bows, arrows, and shields, nearly all of them\\ncarried from their shoulders a sort of net, which held those polished\\nstones their slings hurl with such dexterity.\\n\\nOne of these chieftains came fairly close to the Nautilus, examining\\nit with care. He must have been a “mado” of high rank, because he\\nparaded in a mat of banana leaves that had ragged edges and was\\naccented with bright colors.\\n\\nI could easily have picked off this islander, he stood at such close\\nrange; but I thought it best to wait for an actual show of\\nhostility. Between Europeans and savages, it’s acceptable for\\nEuropeans to shoot back but not to attack first.\\n\\nDuring this whole time of low tide, the islanders lurked near the\\nNautilus, but they weren’t boisterous. I often heard them repeat the\\nword “assai,” and from their gestures I understood they were inviting\\nme to go ashore, an invitation I felt obliged to decline.\\n\\nSo the skiff didn’t leave shipside that day, much to the displeasure\\nof Mr. Land who couldn’t complete his provisions. The adroit Canadian\\nspent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought\\nfrom Gueboroa Island. As for the savages, they went back to shore near\\neleven o’clock in the morning, when the heads of coral began to\\ndisappear under the waves of the rising tide. But I saw their numbers\\nswell considerably on the beach. It was likely that they had come from\\nneighboring islands or from the mainland of Papua proper. However, I\\ndidn’t see one local dugout canoe.\\n\\nHaving nothing better to do, I decided to dredge these beautiful,\\nclear waters, which exhibited a profusion of shells, zoophytes, and\\nopen-sea plants. Besides, it was the last day the Nautilus would spend\\nin these waterways, if, tomorrow, it still floated off to the open sea\\nas Captain Nemo had promised.\\n\\nSo I summoned Conseil, who brought me a small, light dragnet similar\\nto those used in oyster fishing.\\n\\n“What about these savages?” Conseil asked me. “With all due respect to\\nmaster, they don’t strike me as very wicked!”\\n\\n“They’re cannibals even so, my boy.”\\n\\n“A person can be both a cannibal and a decent man,” Conseil replied,\\n“just as a person can be both gluttonous and honorable. The one\\ndoesn’t exclude the other.”\\n\\n“Fine, Conseil! And I agree that there are honorable cannibals who\\ndecently devour their prisoners. However, I’m opposed to being\\ndevoured, even in all decency, so I’ll keep on my guard, especially\\nsince the Nautilus’s commander seems to be taking no precautions. And\\nnow let’s get to work!”\\n\\nFor two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without bringing\\nup any rarities. Our dragnet was filled with Midas abalone, harp\\nshells, obelisk snails, and especially the finest hammer shells I had\\nseen to that day. We also gathered in a few sea cucumbers, some pearl\\noysters, and a dozen small turtles that we saved for the ship’s\\npantry.\\n\\nBut just when I least expected it, I laid my hands on a wonder, a\\nnatural deformity I’d have to call it, something very seldom\\nencountered. Conseil had just made a cast of the dragnet, and his gear\\nhad come back up loaded with a variety of fairly ordinary seashells,\\nwhen suddenly he saw me plunge my arms swiftly into the net, pull out\\na shelled animal, and give a conchological yell, in other words, the\\nmost piercing yell a human throat can produce.\\n\\n“Eh? What happened to master?” Conseil asked, very startled. “Did\\nmaster get bitten?”\\n\\n“No, my boy, but I’d gladly have sacrificed a finger for such a find!”\\n\\n“What find?”\\n\\n“This shell,” I said, displaying the subject of my triumph.\\n\\n“But that’s simply an olive shell of the ‘tent olive’ species, genus\\nOliva, order Pectinibranchia, class Gastropoda, branch Mollusca—”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, Conseil! But instead of coiling from right to left, this\\nolive shell rolls from left to right!”\\n\\n“It can’t be!” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy, it’s a left-handed shell!”\\n\\n“A left-handed shell!” Conseil repeated, his heart pounding.\\n\\n“Look at its spiral!”\\n\\n“Oh, master can trust me on this,” Conseil said, taking the valuable\\nshell in trembling hands, “but never have I felt such excitement!”\\n\\nAnd there was good reason to be excited! In fact, as naturalists have\\nventured to observe, “dextrality” is a well-known law of nature. In\\ntheir rotational and orbital movements, stars and their satellites go\\nfrom right to left. Man uses his right hand more often than his left,\\nand consequently his various instruments and equipment (staircases,\\nlocks, watch springs, etc.) are designed to be used in a right-to-left\\nmanner. Now then, nature has generally obeyed this law in coiling her\\nshells. They’re right-handed with only rare exceptions, and when by\\nchance a shell’s spiral is left-handed, collectors will pay its weight\\nin gold for it.\\n\\nSo Conseil and I were deep in the contemplation of our treasure, and I\\nwas solemnly promising myself to enrich the Paris Museum with it, when\\nan ill-timed stone, hurled by one of the islanders, whizzed over and\\nshattered the valuable object in Conseil’s hands.\\n\\nI gave a yell of despair! Conseil pounced on his rifle and aimed at a\\nsavage swinging a sling just ten meters away from him. I tried to stop\\nhim, but his shot went off and shattered a bracelet of amulets\\ndangling from the islander’s arm.\\n\\n“Conseil!” I shouted. “Conseil!”\\n\\n“Eh? What? Didn’t master see that this man-eater initiated the\\nattack?”\\n\\n“A shell isn’t worth a human life!” I told him.\\n\\n“Oh, the rascal!” Conseil exclaimed. “I’d rather he cracked my\\nshoulder!”\\n\\nConseil was in dead earnest, but I didn’t subscribe to his\\nviews. However, the situation had changed in only a short time and we\\nhadn’t noticed. Now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding the\\nNautilus. Hollowed from tree trunks, these dugouts were long, narrow,\\nand well designed for speed, keeping their balance by means of two\\nbamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water. They were\\nmaneuvered by skillful, half-naked paddlers, and I viewed their\\nadvance with definite alarm.\\n\\nIt was obvious these Papuans had already entered into relations with\\nEuropeans and knew their ships. But this long, iron cylinder lying in\\nthe bay, with no masts or funnels—what were they to make of it?\\nNothing good, because at first they kept it at a respectful\\ndistance. However, seeing that it stayed motionless, they regained\\nconfidence little by little and tried to become more familiar with\\nit. Now then, it was precisely this familiarity that we needed to\\nprevent. Since our weapons made no sound when they went off, they\\nwould have only a moderate effect on these islanders, who reputedly\\nrespect nothing but noisy mechanisms. Without thunderclaps, lightning\\nbolts would be much less frightening, although the danger lies in the\\nflash, not the noise.\\n\\nJust then the dugout canoes drew nearer to the Nautilus, and a cloud\\nof arrows burst over us.\\n\\n“Fire and brimstone, it’s hailing!” Conseil said. “And poisoned hail\\nperhaps!”\\n\\n“We’ve got to alert Captain Nemo,” I said, reentering the hatch.\\n\\nI went below to the lounge. I found no one there. I ventured a knock\\nat the door opening into the captain’s stateroom.\\n\\nThe word “Enter!” answered me. I did so and found Captain Nemo busy\\nwith calculations in which there was no shortage of X and other\\nalgebraic signs.\\n\\n“Am I disturbing you?” I said out of politeness.\\n\\n“Correct, Professor Aronnax,” the captain answered me. “But I imagine\\nyou have pressing reasons for looking me up?”\\n\\n“Very pressing. Native dugout canoes are surrounding us, and in a few\\nminutes we’re sure to be assaulted by several hundred savages.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Captain Nemo put in serenely. “They’ve come in their dugouts?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, closing the hatches should do the trick.”\\n\\n“Precisely, and that’s what I came to tell you—”\\n\\n“Nothing easier,” Captain Nemo said.\\n\\nAnd he pressed an electric button, transmitting an order to the crew’s\\nquarters.\\n\\n“There, sir, all under control!” he told me after a few moments. “The\\nskiff is in place and the hatches are closed. I don’t imagine you’re\\nworried that these gentlemen will stave in walls that shells from your\\nfrigate couldn’t breach?”\\n\\n“No, captain, but one danger still remains.”\\n\\n“What’s that, sir?”\\n\\n“Tomorrow at about this time, we’ll need to reopen the hatches to\\nrenew the Nautilus’s air.”\\n\\n“No argument, sir, since our craft breathes in the manner favored by\\ncetaceans.”\\n\\n“But if these Papuans are occupying the platform at that moment, I\\ndon’t see how you can prevent them from entering.”\\n\\n“Then, sir, you assume they’ll board the ship?”\\n\\n“I’m certain of it.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, let them come aboard. I see no reason to prevent\\nthem. Deep down they’re just poor devils, these Papuans, and I don’t\\nwant my visit to Gueboroa Island to cost the life of a single one of\\nthese unfortunate people!”\\n\\nOn this note I was about to withdraw; but Captain Nemo detained me and\\ninvited me to take a seat next to him. He questioned me with interest\\non our excursions ashore and on our hunting, but seemed not to\\nunderstand the Canadian’s passionate craving for red meat. Then our\\nconversation skimmed various subjects, and without being more\\nforthcoming, Captain Nemo proved more affable.\\n\\nAmong other things, we came to talk of the Nautilus’s circumstances,\\naground in the same strait where Captain Dumont d’Urville had nearly\\nmiscarried. Then, pertinent to this:\\n\\n“He was one of your great seamen,” the captain told me, “one of your\\nshrewdest navigators, that d’Urville! He was the Frenchman’s Captain\\nCook. A man wise but unlucky! Braving the ice banks of the South Pole,\\nthe coral of Oceania, the cannibals of the Pacific, only to perish\\nwretchedly in a train wreck! If that energetic man was able to think\\nabout his life in its last seconds, imagine what his final thoughts\\nmust have been!”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Captain Nemo seemed deeply moved, an emotion I felt was\\nto his credit.\\n\\nThen, chart in hand, we returned to the deeds of the French navigator:\\nhis voyages to circumnavigate the globe, his double attempt at the\\nSouth Pole, which led to his discovery of the Adélie Coast and the\\nLouis-Philippe Peninsula, finally his hydrographic surveys of the\\nchief islands in Oceania.\\n\\n“What your d’Urville did on the surface of the sea,” Captain Nemo told\\nme, “I’ve done in the ocean’s interior, but more easily, more\\ncompletely than he. Constantly tossed about by hurricanes, the Zealous\\nand the new Astrolabe couldn’t compare with the Nautilus, a quiet work\\nroom truly at rest in the midst of the waters!”\\n\\n“Even so, captain,” I said, “there is one major similarity between\\nDumont d’Urville’s sloops of war and the Nautilus.”\\n\\n“What’s that, sir?”\\n\\n“Like them, the Nautilus has run aground!”\\n\\n“The Nautilus is not aground, sir,” Captain Nemo replied icily. “The\\nNautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor, and I don’t need to\\nundertake the arduous labors, the maneuvers d’Urville had to attempt\\nin order to float off his sloops of war. The Zealous and the new\\nAstrolabe wellnigh perished, but my Nautilus is in no\\ndanger. Tomorrow, on the day stated and at the hour stated, the tide\\nwill peacefully lift it off, and it will resume its navigating through\\nthe seas.”\\n\\n“Captain,” I said, “I don’t doubt—”\\n\\n“Tomorrow,” Captain Nemo added, standing up, “tomorrow at 2:40 in the\\nafternoon, the Nautilus will float off and exit the Torres Strait\\nundamaged.”\\n\\nPronouncing these words in an extremely sharp tone, Captain Nemo gave\\nme a curt bow. This was my dismissal, and I reentered my stateroom.\\n\\nThere I found Conseil, who wanted to know the upshot of my interview\\nwith the captain.\\n\\n“My boy,” I replied, “when I expressed the belief that these Papuan\\nnatives were a threat to his Nautilus, the captain answered me with\\ngreat irony. So I’ve just one thing to say to you: have faith in him\\nand sleep in peace.”\\n\\n“Master has no need for my services?”\\n\\n“No, my friend. What’s Ned Land up to?”\\n\\n“Begging master’s indulgence,” Conseil replied, “but our friend Ned is\\nconcocting a kangaroo pie that will be the eighth wonder!”\\n\\nI was left to myself; I went to bed but slept pretty poorly. I kept\\nhearing noises from the savages, who were stamping on the platform and\\nletting out deafening yells. The night passed in this way, without the\\ncrew ever emerging from their usual inertia. They were no more\\ndisturbed by the presence of these man-eaters than soldiers in an\\narmored fortress are troubled by ants running over the armor plate.\\n\\nI got up at six o’clock in the morning. The hatches weren’t open. So\\nthe air inside hadn’t been renewed; but the air tanks were kept full\\nfor any eventuality and would function appropriately to shoot a few\\ncubic meters of oxygen into the Nautilus’s thin atmosphere.\\n\\nI worked in my stateroom until noon without seeing Captain Nemo even\\nfor an instant. Nobody on board seemed to be making any preparations\\nfor departure.\\n\\nI still waited for a while, then I made my way to the main lounge. Its\\ntimepiece marked 2:30. In ten minutes the tide would reach its maximum\\nelevation, and if Captain Nemo hadn’t made a rash promise, the\\nNautilus would immediately break free. If not, many months might pass\\nbefore it could leave its coral bed.\\n\\nBut some preliminary vibrations could soon be felt over the boat’s\\nhull. I heard its plating grind against the limestone roughness of\\nthat coral base.\\n\\nAt 2:35 Captain Nemo appeared in the lounge.\\n\\n“We’re about to depart,” he said.\\n\\n“Ah!” I put in.\\n\\n“I’ve given orders to open the hatches.”\\n\\n“What about the Papuans?”\\n\\n“What about them?” Captain Nemo replied, with a light shrug of his\\nshoulders.\\n\\n“Won’t they come inside the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“How will they manage that?”\\n\\n“By jumping down the hatches you’re about to open.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo replied serenely, “the Nautilus’s\\nhatches aren’t to be entered in that fashion even when they’re open.”\\n\\nI gaped at the captain.\\n\\n“You don’t understand?” he said to me.\\n\\n“Not in the least.”\\n\\n“Well, come along and you’ll see!”\\n\\nI headed to the central companionway. There, very puzzled, Ned Land\\nand Conseil watched the crewmen opening the hatches, while a frightful\\nclamor and furious shouts resounded outside.\\n\\nThe hatch lids fell back onto the outer plating. Twenty horrible faces\\nappeared. But when the first islander laid hands on the companionway\\nrailing, he was flung backward by some invisible power, lord knows\\nwhat! He ran off, howling in terror and wildly prancing around.\\n\\nTen of his companions followed him. All ten met the same fate.\\n\\nConseil was in ecstasy. Carried away by his violent instincts, Ned\\nLand leaped up the companionway. But as soon as his hands seized the\\nrailing, he was thrown backward in his turn.\\n\\n“Damnation!” he exclaimed. “I’ve been struck by a lightning bolt!”\\n\\nThese words explained everything to me. It wasn’t just a railing that\\nled to the platform, it was a metal cable fully charged with the\\nship’s electricity. Anyone who touched it got a fearsome shock—and\\nsuch a shock would have been fatal if Captain Nemo had thrown the full\\ncurrent from his equipment into this conducting cable! It could\\nhonestly be said that he had stretched between himself and his\\nassailants a network of electricity no one could clear with impunity.\\n\\nMeanwhile, crazed with terror, the unhinged Papuans beat a retreat. As\\nfor us, half laughing, we massaged and comforted poor Ned Land, who\\nwas swearing like one possessed.\\n\\nBut just then, lifted off by the tide’s final undulations, the\\nNautilus left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed\\nby the captain. Its propeller churned the waves with lazy\\nmajesty. Gathering speed little by little, the ship navigated on the\\nsurface of the ocean, and safe and sound, it left behind the dangerous\\nnarrows of the Torres Strait.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\n“Aegri Somnia”*\\n\\n\\n*Latin: “troubled dreams.” Ed.\\n\\nTHE FOLLOWING DAY, January 10, the Nautilus resumed its travels in\\nmidwater but at a remarkable speed that I estimated to be at least\\nthirty-five miles per hour. The propeller was going so fast I could\\nneither follow nor count its revolutions.\\n\\nI thought about how this marvelous electric force not only gave\\nmotion, heat, and light to the Nautilus but even protected it against\\noutside attack, transforming it into a sacred ark no profane hand\\ncould touch without being blasted; my wonderment was boundless, and it\\nwent from the submersible itself to the engineer who had created it.\\n\\nWe were traveling due west and on January 11 we doubled Cape Wessel,\\nlocated in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north, the\\nwestern tip of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Reefs were still numerous but\\nmore widely scattered and were fixed on the chart with the greatest\\naccuracy. The Nautilus easily avoided the Money breakers to port and\\nthe Victoria reefs to starboard, positioned at longitude 130 degrees\\non the tenth parallel, which we went along rigorously.\\n\\nOn January 13, arriving in the Timor Sea, Captain Nemo raised the\\nisland of that name at longitude 122 degrees. This island, whose\\nsurface area measures 1,625 square leagues, is governed by\\nrajahs. These aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles, in\\nother words, descendants with the most exalted origins to which a\\nhuman being can lay claim. Accordingly, their scaly ancestors infest\\nthe island’s rivers and are the subjects of special veneration. They\\nare sheltered, nurtured, flattered, pampered, and offered a ritual\\ndiet of nubile maidens; and woe to the foreigner who lifts a finger\\nagainst these sacred saurians.\\n\\nBut the Nautilus wanted nothing to do with these nasty animals. Timor\\nIsland was visible for barely an instant at noon while the chief\\nofficer determined his position. I also caught only a glimpse of\\nlittle Roti Island, part of this same group, whose women have a\\nwell-established reputation for beauty in the Malaysian marketplace.\\n\\nAfter our position fix, the Nautilus’s latitude bearings were\\nmodulated to the southwest. Our prow pointed to the Indian\\nOcean. Where would Captain Nemo’s fancies take us? Would he head up to\\nthe shores of Asia? Would he pull nearer to the beaches of Europe?\\nUnlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas! So would he go\\ndown south? Would he double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and\\npush on to the Antarctic pole? Finally, would he return to the seas of\\nthe Pacific, where his Nautilus could navigate freely and easily? Time\\nwould tell.\\n\\nAfter cruising along the Cartier, Hibernia, Seringapatam, and Scott\\nreefs, the solid element’s last exertions against the liquid element,\\nwe were beyond all sight of shore by January 14. The Nautilus slowed\\ndown in an odd manner, and very unpredictable in its ways, it\\nsometimes swam in the midst of the waters, sometimes drifted on their\\nsurface.\\n\\nDuring this phase of our voyage, Captain Nemo conducted interesting\\nexperiments on the different temperatures in various strata of the\\nsea. Under ordinary conditions, such readings are obtained using some\\npretty complicated instruments whose findings are dubious to say the\\nleast, whether they’re thermometric sounding lines, whose glass often\\nshatters under the water’s pressure, or those devices based on the\\nvarying resistance of metals to electric currents. The results so\\nobtained can’t be adequately double-checked. By contrast, Captain Nemo\\nwould seek the sea’s temperature by going himself into its depths, and\\nwhen he placed his thermometer in contact with the various layers of\\nliquid, he found the sought-for degree immediately and with certainty.\\n\\nAnd so, by loading up its ballast tanks, or by sinking obliquely with\\nits slanting fins, the Nautilus successively reached depths of 3,000,\\n4,000, 5,000, 7,000, 9,000, and 10,000 meters, and the ultimate\\nconclusion from these experiments was that, in all latitudes, the sea\\nhad a permanent temperature of 4.5 degrees centigrade at a depth of\\n1,000 meters.\\n\\nI watched these experiments with the most intense fascination. Captain\\nNemo brought a real passion to them. I often wondered why he took\\nthese observations. Were they for the benefit of his fellow man? It\\nwas unlikely, because sooner or later his work would perish with him\\nin some unknown sea! Unless he intended the results of his experiments\\nfor me. But that meant this strange voyage of mine would come to an\\nend, and no such end was in sight.\\n\\nBe that as it may, Captain Nemo also introduced me to the different\\ndata he had obtained on the relative densities of the water in our\\nglobe’s chief seas. From this news I derived some personal\\nenlightenment having nothing to do with science.\\n\\nIt happened the morning of January 15. The captain, with whom I was\\nstrolling on the platform, asked me if I knew how salt water differs\\nin density from sea to sea. I said no, adding that there was a lack of\\nrigorous scientific observations on this subject.\\n\\n“I’ve taken such observations,” he told me, “and I can vouch for their\\nreliability.”\\n\\n“Fine,” I replied, “but the Nautilus lives in a separate world, and\\nthe secrets of its scientists don’t make their way ashore.”\\n\\n“You’re right, professor,” he told me after a few moments of\\nsilence. “This is a separate world. It’s as alien to the earth as the\\nplanets accompanying our globe around the sun, and we’ll never become\\nfamiliar with the work of scientists on Saturn or Jupiter. But since\\nfate has linked our two lives, I can reveal the results of my\\nobservations to you.”\\n\\n“I’m all attention, captain.”\\n\\n“You’re aware, professor, that salt water is denser than fresh water,\\nbut this density isn’t uniform. In essence, if I represent the density\\nof fresh water by 1.000, then I find 1.028 for the waters of the\\nAtlantic, 1.026 for the waters of the Pacific, 1.030 for the waters of\\nthe Mediterranean—”\\n\\nAha, I thought, so he ventures into the Mediterranean?\\n\\n“—1.018 for the waters of the Ionian Sea, and 1.029 for the waters of\\nthe Adriatic.”\\n\\nAssuredly, the Nautilus didn’t avoid the heavily traveled seas of\\nEurope, and from this insight I concluded that the ship would take us\\nback—perhaps very soon—to more civilized shores. I expected Ned Land\\nto greet this news with unfeigned satisfaction.\\n\\nFor several days our work hours were spent in all sorts of\\nexperiments, on the degree of salinity in waters of different depths,\\nor on their electric properties, coloration, and transparency, and in\\nevery instance Captain Nemo displayed an ingenuity equaled only by his\\ngraciousness toward me. Then I saw no more of him for some days and\\nagain lived on board in seclusion.\\n\\nOn January 16 the Nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few\\nmeters beneath the surface of the water. Its electric equipment had\\nbeen turned off, and the motionless propeller let it ride with the\\nwaves. I assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs,\\nrequired by the engine’s strenuous mechanical action.\\n\\nMy companions and I then witnessed an unusual sight. The panels in the\\nlounge were open, and since the Nautilus’s beacon was off, a hazy\\ndarkness reigned in the midst of the waters. Covered with heavy\\nclouds, the stormy sky gave only the faintest light to the ocean’s\\nupper strata.\\n\\nI was observing the state of the sea under these conditions, and even\\nthe largest fish were nothing more than ill-defined shadows, when the\\nNautilus was suddenly transferred into broad daylight. At first I\\nthought the beacon had gone back on and was casting its electric light\\ninto the liquid mass. I was mistaken, and after a hasty examination I\\ndiscovered my error.\\n\\nThe Nautilus had drifted into the midst of some phosphorescent strata,\\nwhich, in this darkness, came off as positively dazzling. This effect\\nwas caused by myriads of tiny, luminous animals whose brightness\\nincreased when they glided over the metal hull of our submersible. In\\nthe midst of these luminous sheets of water, I then glimpsed flashes\\nof light, like those seen inside a blazing furnace from streams of\\nmolten lead or from masses of metal brought to a white heat—flashes so\\nintense that certain areas of the light became shadows by comparison,\\nin a fiery setting from which every shadow should seemingly have been\\nbanished. No, this was no longer the calm emission of our usual\\nlighting! This light throbbed with unprecedented vigor and activity!\\nYou sensed that it was alive!\\n\\nIn essence, it was a cluster of countless open-sea infusoria, of\\nnoctiluca an eighth of an inch wide, actual globules of transparent\\njelly equipped with a threadlike tentacle, up to 25,000 of which have\\nbeen counted in thirty cubic centimeters of water. And the power of\\ntheir light was increased by those glimmers unique to medusas,\\nstarfish, common jellyfish, angel-wing clams, and other phosphorescent\\nzoophytes, which were saturated with grease from organic matter\\ndecomposed by the sea, and perhaps with mucus secreted by fish.\\n\\nFor several hours the Nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide, and our\\nwonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it, like\\nthe fire-dwelling salamanders of myth. In the midst of these flames\\nthat didn’t burn, I could see swift, elegant porpoises, the tireless\\npranksters of the seas, and sailfish three meters long, those shrewd\\nheralds of hurricanes, whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged\\nagainst the lounge window. Then smaller fish appeared: miscellaneous\\ntriggerfish, leather jacks, unicornfish, and a hundred others that\\nleft stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course.\\n\\nSome magic lay behind this dazzling sight! Perhaps some atmospheric\\ncondition had intensified this phenomenon? Perhaps a storm had been\\nunleashed on the surface of the waves? But only a few meters down, the\\nNautilus felt no tempest’s fury, and the ship rocked peacefully in the\\nmidst of the calm waters.\\n\\nAnd so it went, some new wonder constantly delighting us. Conseil\\nobserved and classified his zoophytes, articulates, mollusks, and\\nfish. The days passed quickly, and I no longer kept track of\\nthem. Ned, as usual, kept looking for changes of pace from our\\nstandard fare. Like actual snails, we were at home in our shell, and I\\ncan vouch that it’s easy to turn into a full-fledged snail.\\n\\nSo this way of living began to seem simple and natural to us, and we\\nno longer envisioned a different lifestyle on the surface of the\\nplanet earth, when something happened to remind us of our strange\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nOn January 18 the Nautilus lay in longitude 105 degrees and latitude\\n15 degrees south. The weather was threatening, the sea rough and\\nbillowy. The wind was blowing a strong gust from the east. The\\nbarometer, which had been falling for some days, forecast an\\napproaching struggle of the elements.\\n\\nI had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking\\nhis readings of hour angles. Out of habit I waited for him to\\npronounce his daily phrase. But that day it was replaced by a\\ndifferent phrase, just as incomprehensible. Almost at once I saw\\nCaptain Nemo appear, lift his spyglass, and inspect the horizon.\\n\\nFor some minutes the captain stood motionless, rooted to the spot\\ncontained within the field of his lens. Then he lowered his spyglass\\nand exchanged about ten words with his chief officer. The latter\\nseemed to be in the grip of an excitement he tried in vain to\\ncontrol. More in command of himself, Captain Nemo remained\\ncool. Furthermore, he seemed to be raising certain objections that his\\nchief officer kept answering with flat assurances. At least that’s\\nwhat I gathered from their differences in tone and gesture.\\n\\nAs for me, I stared industriously in the direction under observation\\nbut without spotting a thing. Sky and water merged into a perfectly\\nclean horizon line.\\n\\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the\\nother, not glancing at me, perhaps not even seeing me. His step was\\nfirm but less regular than usual. Sometimes he would stop, cross his\\narms over his chest, and observe the sea. What could he be looking for\\nover that immense expanse? By then the Nautilus lay hundreds of miles\\nfrom the nearest coast!\\n\\nThe chief officer kept lifting his spyglass and stubbornly examining\\nthe horizon, walking up and down, stamping his foot, in his nervous\\nagitation a sharp contrast to his superior.\\n\\nBut this mystery would inevitably be cleared up, and soon, because\\nCaptain Nemo gave orders to increase speed; at once the engine stepped\\nup its drive power, setting the propeller in swifter rotation.\\n\\nJust then the chief officer drew the captain’s attention anew. The\\nlatter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point\\nindicated. He observed it a good while. As for me, deeply puzzled, I\\nwent below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long-range\\ntelescope I habitually used. Leaning my elbows on the beacon housing,\\nwhich jutted from the stern of the platform, I got set to scour that\\nwhole stretch of sky and sea.\\n\\nBut no sooner had I peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was\\nsnatched from my hands.\\n\\nI spun around. Captain Nemo was standing before me, but I almost\\ndidn’t recognize him. His facial features were transfigured. Gleaming\\nwith dark fire, his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow. His\\nteeth were half bared. His rigid body, clenched fists, and head drawn\\nbetween his shoulders, all attested to a fierce hate breathing from\\nevery pore. He didn’t move. My spyglass fell from his hand and rolled\\nat his feet.\\n\\nHad I accidentally caused these symptoms of anger? Did this\\nincomprehensible individual think I had detected some secret forbidden\\nto guests on the Nautilus?\\n\\nNo! I wasn’t the subject of his hate because he wasn’t even looking at\\nme; his eyes stayed stubbornly focused on that inscrutable point of\\nthe horizon.\\n\\nFinally Captain Nemo regained his self-control. His facial appearance,\\nso profoundly changed, now resumed its usual calm. He addressed a few\\nwords to his chief officer in their strange language, then he turned\\nto me:\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he told me in a tone of some urgency, “I ask that\\nyou now honor one of the binding agreements between us.”\\n\\n“Which one, captain?”\\n\\n“You and your companions must be placed in confinement until I see fit\\nto set you free.”\\n\\n“You’re in command,” I answered, gaping at him. “But may I address a\\nquestion to you?”\\n\\n“You may not, sir.”\\n\\nAfter that, I stopped objecting and started obeying, since resistance\\nwas useless.\\n\\nI went below to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil, and I\\ninformed them of the captain’s decision. I’ll let the reader decide\\nhow this news was received by the Canadian. In any case, there was no\\ntime for explanations. Four crewmen were waiting at the door, and they\\nled us to the cell where we had spent our first night aboard the\\nNautilus.\\n\\nNed Land tried to lodge a complaint, but the only answer he got was a\\ndoor shut in his face.\\n\\n“Will master tell me what this means?” Conseil asked me.\\n\\nI told my companions what had happened. They were as astonished as I\\nwas, but no wiser.\\n\\nThen I sank into deep speculation, and Captain Nemo’s strange facial\\nseizure kept haunting me. I was incapable of connecting two ideas in\\nlogical order, and I had strayed into the most absurd hypotheses, when\\nI was snapped out of my mental struggles by these words from Ned Land:\\n\\n“Well, look here! Lunch is served!”\\n\\nIndeed, the table had been laid. Apparently Captain Nemo had given\\nthis order at the same time he commanded the Nautilus to pick up\\nspeed.\\n\\n“Will master allow me to make him a recommendation?” Conseil asked me.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” I replied.\\n\\n“Well, master needs to eat his lunch! It’s prudent, because we have no\\nidea what the future holds.”\\n\\n“You’re right, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Unfortunately,” Ned Land said, “they’ve only given us the standard\\nmenu.”\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” Conseil answered, “what would you say if they’d given\\nus no lunch at all?”\\n\\nThis dose of sanity cut the harpooner’s complaints clean off.\\n\\nWe sat down at the table. Our meal proceeded pretty much in silence. I\\nate very little. Conseil, everlastingly prudent, “force-fed” himself;\\nand despite the menu, Ned Land didn’t waste a bite. Then, lunch over,\\neach of us propped himself in a corner.\\n\\nJust then the luminous globe lighting our cell went out, leaving us in\\nprofound darkness. Ned Land soon dozed off, and to my astonishment,\\nConseil also fell into a heavy slumber. I was wondering what could\\nhave caused this urgent need for sleep, when I felt a dense torpor\\nsaturate my brain. I tried to keep my eyes open, but they closed in\\nspite of me. I was in the grip of anguished hallucinations. Obviously\\nsome sleep-inducing substance had been laced into the food we’d just\\neaten! So imprisonment wasn’t enough to conceal Captain Nemo’s plans\\nfrom us—sleep was needed as well!\\n\\nThen I heard the hatches close. The sea’s undulations, which had been\\ncreating a gentle rocking motion, now ceased. Had the Nautilus left\\nthe surface of the ocean? Was it reentering the motionless strata deep\\nin the sea?\\n\\nI tried to fight off this drowsiness. It was impossible. My breathing\\ngrew weaker. I felt a mortal chill freeze my dull, nearly paralyzed\\nlimbs. Like little domes of lead, my lids fell over my eyes. I\\ncouldn’t raise them. A morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, seized my\\nwhole being. Then the visions disappeared and left me in utter\\noblivion.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 24\\n\\nThe Coral Realm\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY I woke up with my head unusually clear. Much to my\\nsurprise, I was in my stateroom. No doubt my companions had been put\\nback in their cabin without noticing it any more than I had. Like me,\\nthey would have no idea what took place during the night, and to\\nunravel this mystery I could count only on some future happenstance.\\n\\nI then considered leaving my stateroom. Was I free or still a\\nprisoner? Perfectly free. I opened my door, headed down the gangways,\\nand climbed the central companionway. Hatches that had been closed the\\nday before were now open. I arrived on the platform.\\n\\nNed Land and Conseil were there waiting for me. I questioned\\nthem. They knew nothing. Lost in a heavy sleep of which they had no\\nmemory, they were quite startled to be back in their cabin.\\n\\nAs for the Nautilus, it seemed as tranquil and mysterious as ever. It\\nwas cruising on the surface of the waves at a moderate speed. Nothing\\nseemed to have changed on board.\\n\\nNed Land observed the sea with his penetrating eyes. It was\\ndeserted. The Canadian sighted nothing new on the horizon, neither\\nsail nor shore. A breeze was blowing noisily from the west, and\\ndisheveled by the wind, long billows made the submersible roll very\\nnoticeably.\\n\\nAfter renewing its air, the Nautilus stayed at an average depth of\\nfifteen meters, enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the\\nwaves. And, contrary to custom, it executed such a maneuver several\\ntimes during that day of January 19. The chief officer would then\\nclimb onto the platform, and his usual phrase would ring through the\\nship’s interior.\\n\\nAs for Captain Nemo, he didn’t appear. Of the other men on board, I\\nsaw only my emotionless steward, who served me with his usual mute\\nefficiency.\\n\\nNear two o’clock I was busy organizing my notes in the lounge, when\\nthe captain opened the door and appeared. I bowed to him. He gave me\\nan almost imperceptible bow in return, without saying a word to me. I\\nresumed my work, hoping he might give me some explanation of the\\nprevious afternoon’s events. He did nothing of the sort. I stared at\\nhim. His face looked exhausted; his reddened eyes hadn’t been\\nrefreshed by sleep; his facial features expressed profound sadness,\\nreal chagrin. He walked up and down, sat and stood, picked up a book\\nat random, discarded it immediately, consulted his instruments without\\ntaking his customary notes, and seemed unable to rest easy for an\\ninstant.\\n\\nFinally he came over to me and said:\\n\\n“Are you a physician, Professor Aronnax?”\\n\\nThis inquiry was so unexpected that I stared at him a good while\\nwithout replying.\\n\\n“Are you a physician?” he repeated. “Several of your scientific\\ncolleagues took their degrees in medicine, such as Gratiolet,\\nMoquin-Tandon, and others.”\\n\\n“That’s right,” I said, “I am a doctor, I used to be on call at the\\nhospitals. I was in practice for several years before joining the\\nmuseum.”\\n\\n“Excellent, sir.”\\n\\nMy reply obviously pleased Captain Nemo. But not knowing what he was\\ndriving at, I waited for further questions, ready to reply as\\ncircumstances dictated.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” the captain said to me, “would you consent to\\ngive your medical attentions to one of my men?”\\n\\n“Someone is sick?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I’m ready to go with you.”\\n\\n“Come.”\\n\\nI admit that my heart was pounding. Lord knows why, but I saw a\\ndefinite connection between this sick crewman and yesterday’s\\nhappenings, and the mystery of those events concerned me at least as\\nmuch as the man’s sickness.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo led me to the Nautilus’s stern and invited me into a\\ncabin located next to the sailors’ quarters.\\n\\nOn a bed there lay a man some forty years old, with strongly molded\\nfeatures, the very image of an Anglo-Saxon.\\n\\nI bent over him. Not only was he sick, he was wounded. Swathed in\\nblood-soaked linen, his head was resting on a folded pillow. I undid\\nthe linen bandages, while the wounded man gazed with great staring\\neyes and let me proceed without making a single complaint.\\n\\nIt was a horrible wound. The cranium had been smashed open by some\\nblunt instrument, leaving the naked brains exposed, and the cerebral\\nmatter had suffered deep abrasions. Blood clots had formed in this\\ndissolving mass, taking on the color of wine dregs. Both contusion and\\nconcussion of the brain had occurred. The sick man’s breathing was\\nlabored, and muscle spasms quivered in his face. Cerebral inflammation\\nwas complete and had brought on a paralysis of movement and sensation.\\n\\nI took the wounded man’s pulse. It was intermittent. The body’s\\nextremities were already growing cold, and I saw that death was\\napproaching without any possibility of my holding it in check. After\\ndressing the poor man’s wound, I redid the linen bandages around his\\nhead, and I turned to Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“How did he get this wound?” I asked him.\\n\\n“That’s not important,” the captain replied evasively. “The Nautilus\\nsuffered a collision that cracked one of the engine levers, and it\\nstruck this man. My chief officer was standing beside him. This man\\nleaped forward to intercept the blow. A brother lays down his life for\\nhis brother, a friend for his friend, what could be simpler? That’s\\nthe law for everyone on board the Nautilus. But what’s your diagnosis\\nof his condition?”\\n\\nI hesitated to speak my mind.\\n\\n“You may talk freely,” the captain told me. “This man doesn’t\\nunderstand French.”\\n\\nI took a last look at the wounded man, then I replied:\\n\\n“This man will be dead in two hours.”\\n\\n“Nothing can save him?”\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo clenched his fists, and tears slid from his eyes, which I\\nhad thought incapable of weeping.\\n\\nFor a few moments more I observed the dying man, whose life was ebbing\\nlittle by little. He grew still more pale under the electric light\\nthat bathed his deathbed. I looked at his intelligent head, furrowed\\nwith premature wrinkles that misfortune, perhaps misery, had etched\\nlong before. I was hoping to detect the secret of his life in the last\\nwords that might escape from his lips!\\n\\n“You may go, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo told me.\\n\\nI left the captain in the dying man’s cabin and I repaired to my\\nstateroom, very moved by this scene. All day long I was aquiver with\\ngruesome forebodings. That night I slept poorly, and between my fitful\\ndreams, I thought I heard a distant moaning, like a funeral dirge. Was\\nit a prayer for the dead, murmured in that language I couldn’t\\nunderstand?\\n\\nThe next morning I climbed on deck. Captain Nemo was already there. As\\nsoon as he saw me, he came over.\\n\\n“Professor,” he said to me, “would it be convenient for you to make an\\nunderwater excursion today?”\\n\\n“With my companions?” I asked.\\n\\n“If they’re agreeable.”\\n\\n“We’re yours to command, captain.”\\n\\n“Then kindly put on your diving suits.”\\n\\nAs for the dead or dying man, he hadn’t come into the picture. I\\nrejoined Ned Land and Conseil. I informed them of Captain Nemo’s\\nproposition. Conseil was eager to accept, and this time the Canadian\\nproved perfectly amenable to going with us.\\n\\nIt was eight o’clock in the morning. By 8:30 we were suited up for\\nthis new stroll and equipped with our two devices for lighting and\\nbreathing. The double door opened, and accompanied by Captain Nemo\\nwith a dozen crewmen following, we set foot on the firm seafloor where\\nthe Nautilus was resting, ten meters down.\\n\\nA gentle slope gravitated to an uneven bottom whose depth was about\\nfifteen fathoms. This bottom was completely different from the one I\\nhad visited during my first excursion under the waters of the Pacific\\nOcean. Here I saw no fine-grained sand, no underwater prairies, not\\none open-sea forest. I immediately recognized the wondrous region in\\nwhich Captain Nemo did the honors that day. It was the coral realm.\\n\\nIn the zoophyte branch, class Alcyonaria, one finds the order\\nGorgonaria, which contains three groups: sea fans, isidian polyps, and\\ncoral polyps. It’s in this last that precious coral belongs, an\\nunusual substance that, at different times, has been classified in the\\nmineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. Medicine to the ancients,\\njewelry to the moderns, it wasn’t decisively placed in the animal\\nkingdom until 1694, by Peysonnel of Marseilles.\\n\\nA coral is a unit of tiny animals assembled over a polypary that’s\\nbrittle and stony in nature. These polyps have a unique generating\\nmechanism that reproduces them via the budding process, and they have\\nan individual existence while also participating in a communal\\nlife. Hence they embody a sort of natural socialism. I was familiar\\nwith the latest research on this bizarre zoophyte—which turns to stone\\nwhile taking on a tree form, as some naturalists have very aptly\\nobserved—and nothing could have been more fascinating to me than to\\nvisit one of these petrified forests that nature has planted on the\\nbottom of the sea.\\n\\nWe turned on our Ruhmkorff devices and went along a coral shoal in the\\nprocess of forming, which, given time, will someday close off this\\nwhole part of the Indian Ocean. Our path was bordered by hopelessly\\ntangled bushes, formed from snarls of shrubs all covered with little\\nstar-shaped, white-streaked flowers. Only, contrary to plants on\\nshore, these tree forms become attached to rocks on the seafloor by\\nheading from top to bottom.\\n\\nOur lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over\\nthese brightly colored boughs. I fancied I saw these cylindrical,\\nmembrane-filled tubes trembling beneath the water’s undulations. I was\\ntempted to gather their fresh petals, which were adorned with delicate\\ntentacles, some newly in bloom, others barely opened, while nimble\\nfish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds. But\\nif my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive, lively\\ncreatures, an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony. The\\nwhite petals retracted into their red sheaths, the flowers vanished\\nbefore my eyes, and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples.\\n\\nSheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable\\nspecimens of this zoophyte. This coral was the equal of those fished\\nup from the Mediterranean off the Barbary Coast or the shores of\\nFrance and Italy. With its bright colors, it lived up to those poetic\\nnames of blood flower and blood foam that the industry confers on its\\nfinest exhibits. Coral sells for as much as 500 francs per kilogram,\\nand in this locality the liquid strata hid enough to make the fortunes\\nof a whole host of coral fishermen. This valuable substance often\\nmerges with other polyparies, forming compact, hopelessly tangled\\nunits known as “macciota,” and I noted some wonderful pink samples of\\nthis coral.\\n\\nBut as the bushes shrank, the tree forms magnified. Actual petrified\\nthickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture\\nkept opening up before our steps. Captain Nemo entered beneath a dark\\ngallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters. The light\\nfrom our glass coils produced magical effects at times, lingering on\\nthe wrinkled roughness of some natural arch, or some overhang\\nsuspended like a chandelier, which our lamps flecked with fiery\\nsparks. Amid these shrubs of precious coral, I observed other polyps\\nno less unusual: melita coral, rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths,\\nthen a few tufts of genus Corallina, some green and others red,\\nactually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts, which,\\nafter long disputes, naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable\\nkingdom. But as one intellectual has remarked, “Here, perhaps, is the\\nactual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone, but\\nwithout breaking away from its crude starting point.”\\n\\nFinally, after two hours of walking, we reached a depth of about 300\\nmeters, in other words, the lowermost limit at which coral can begin\\nto form. But here it was no longer some isolated bush or a modest\\ngrove of low timber. It was an immense forest, huge mineral\\nvegetation, enormous petrified trees linked by garlands of elegant\\nhydras from the genus Plumularia, those tropical creepers of the sea,\\nall decked out in shades and gleams. We passed freely under their\\nlofty boughs, lost up in the shadows of the waves, while at our feet\\norgan-pipe coral, stony coral, star coral, fungus coral, and sea\\nanemone from the genus Caryophylia formed a carpet of flowers all\\nstrewn with dazzling gems.\\n\\nWhat an indescribable sight! Oh, if only we could share our feelings!\\nWhy were we imprisoned behind these masks of metal and glass! Why were\\nwe forbidden to talk with each other! At least let us lead the lives\\nof the fish that populate this liquid element, or better yet, the\\nlives of amphibians, which can spend long hours either at sea or on\\nshore, traveling through their double domain as their whims dictate!\\n\\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo had called a halt. My companions and I stopped\\nwalking, and turning around, I saw the crewmen form a semicircle\\naround their leader. Looking with greater care, I observed that four\\nof them were carrying on their shoulders an object that was oblong in\\nshape.\\n\\nAt this locality we stood in the center of a huge clearing surrounded\\nby the tall tree forms of this underwater forest. Our lamps cast a\\nsort of brilliant twilight over the area, making inordinately long\\nshadows on the seafloor. Past the boundaries of the clearing, the\\ndarkness deepened again, relieved only by little sparkles given off by\\nthe sharp crests of coral.\\n\\nNed Land and Conseil stood next to me. We stared, and it dawned on me\\nthat I was about to witness a strange scene. Observing the seafloor, I\\nsaw that it swelled at certain points from low bulges that were\\nencrusted with limestone deposits and arranged with a symmetry that\\nbetrayed the hand of man.\\n\\nIn the middle of the clearing, on a pedestal of roughly piled rocks,\\nthere stood a cross of coral, extending long arms you would have\\nthought were made of petrified blood.\\n\\nAt a signal from Captain Nemo, one of his men stepped forward and, a\\nfew feet from this cross, detached a mattock from his belt and began\\nto dig a hole.\\n\\nI finally understood! This clearing was a cemetery, this hole a grave,\\nthat oblong object the body of the man who must have died during the\\nnight! Captain Nemo and his men had come to bury their companion in\\nthis communal resting place on the inaccessible ocean floor!\\n\\nNo! My mind was reeling as never before! Never had ideas of such\\nimpact raced through my brain! I didn’t want to see what my eyes saw!\\n\\nMeanwhile the grave digging went slowly. Fish fled here and there as\\ntheir retreat was disturbed. I heard the pick ringing on the limestone\\nsoil, its iron tip sometimes giving off sparks when it hit a stray\\npiece of flint on the sea bottom. The hole grew longer, wider, and\\nsoon was deep enough to receive the body.\\n\\nThen the pallbearers approached. Wrapped in white fabric made from\\nfilaments of the fan mussel, the body was lowered into its watery\\ngrave. Captain Nemo, arms crossed over his chest, knelt in a posture\\nof prayer, as did all the friends of him who had loved them. . . . My\\ntwo companions and I bowed reverently.\\n\\nThe grave was then covered over with the rubble dug from the seafloor,\\nand it formed a low mound.\\n\\nWhen this was done, Captain Nemo and his men stood up; then they all\\napproached the grave, sank again on bended knee, and extended their\\nhands in a sign of final farewell. . . .\\n\\nThen the funeral party went back up the path to the Nautilus,\\nreturning beneath the arches of the forest, through the thickets,\\nalong the coral bushes, going steadily higher.\\n\\nFinally the ship’s rays appeared. Their luminous trail guided us to\\nthe Nautilus. By one o’clock we had returned.\\n\\nAfter changing clothes, I climbed onto the platform, and in the grip\\nof dreadfully obsessive thoughts, I sat next to the beacon.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo rejoined me. I stood up and said to him:\\n\\n“So, as I predicted, that man died during the night?”\\n\\n“Yes, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo replied.\\n\\n“And now he rests beside his companions in that coral cemetery?”\\n\\n“Yes, forgotten by the world but not by us! We dig the graves, then\\nentrust the polyps with sealing away our dead for eternity!”\\n\\nAnd with a sudden gesture, the captain hid his face in his clenched\\nfists, vainly trying to hold back a sob. Then he added:\\n\\n“There lies our peaceful cemetery, hundreds of feet beneath the\\nsurface of the waves!”\\n\\n“At least, captain, your dead can sleep serenely there, out of the\\nreach of sharks!”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” Captain Nemo replied solemnly, “of sharks and men!”\\n\\n\\nEND OF THE FIRST PART\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND PART\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\nThe Indian Ocean\\n\\n\\nNOW WE BEGIN the second part of this voyage under the seas. The first\\nended in that moving scene at the coral cemetery, which left a\\nprofound impression on my mind. And so Captain Nemo would live out his\\nlife entirely in the heart of this immense sea, and even his grave lay\\nready in its impenetrable depths. There the last sleep of the\\nNautilus’s occupants, friends bound together in death as in life,\\nwould be disturbed by no monster of the deep! “No man either!” the\\ncaptain had added.\\n\\nAlways that same fierce, implacable defiance of human society!\\n\\nAs for me, I was no longer content with the hypotheses that satisfied\\nConseil. That fine lad persisted in seeing the Nautilus’s commander as\\nmerely one of those unappreciated scientists who repay humanity’s\\nindifference with contempt. For Conseil, the captain was still a\\nmisunderstood genius who, tired of the world’s deceptions, had been\\ndriven to take refuge in this inaccessible environment where he was\\nfree to follow his instincts. But to my mind, this hypothesis\\nexplained only one side of Captain Nemo.\\n\\nIn fact, the mystery of that last afternoon when we were locked in\\nprison and put to sleep, the captain’s violent precaution of snatching\\nfrom my grasp a spyglass poised to scour the horizon, and the fatal\\nwound given that man during some unexplained collision suffered by the\\nNautilus, all led me down a plain trail. No! Captain Nemo wasn’t\\ncontent simply to avoid humanity! His fearsome submersible served not\\nonly his quest for freedom, but also, perhaps, it was used in\\nlord-knows-what schemes of dreadful revenge.\\n\\nRight now, nothing is clear to me, I still glimpse only glimmers in\\nthe dark, and I must limit my pen, as it were, to taking dictation\\nfrom events.\\n\\nBut nothing binds us to Captain Nemo. He believes that escaping from\\nthe Nautilus is impossible. We are not even constrained by our word of\\nhonor. No promises fetter us. We’re simply captives, prisoners\\nmasquerading under the name “guests” for the sake of everyday\\ncourtesy. Even so, Ned Land hasn’t given up all hope of recovering his\\nfreedom. He’s sure to take advantage of the first chance that comes\\nhis way. No doubt I will do likewise. And yet I will feel some regret\\nat making off with the Nautilus’s secrets, so generously unveiled for\\nus by Captain Nemo! Because, ultimately, should we detest or admire\\nthis man? Is he the persecutor or the persecuted? And in all honesty,\\nbefore I leave him forever, I want to finish this underwater tour of\\nthe world, whose first stages have been so magnificent. I want to\\nobserve the full series of these wonders gathered under the seas of\\nour globe. I want to see what no man has seen yet, even if I must pay\\nfor this insatiable curiosity with my life! What are my discoveries to\\ndate? Nothing, relatively speaking—since so far we’ve covered only\\n6,000 leagues across the Pacific!\\n\\nNevertheless, I’m well aware that the Nautilus is drawing near to\\npopulated shores, and if some chance for salvation becomes available\\nto us, it would be sheer cruelty to sacrifice my companions to my\\npassion for the unknown. I must go with them, perhaps even guide\\nthem. But will this opportunity ever arise? The human being, robbed of\\nhis free will, craves such an opportunity; but the scientist, forever\\ninquisitive, dreads it.\\n\\nThat day, January 21, 1868, the chief officer went at noon to take the\\nsun’s altitude. I climbed onto the platform, lit a cigar, and watched\\nhim at work. It seemed obvious to me that this man didn’t understand\\nFrench, because I made several remarks in a loud voice that were bound\\nto provoke him to some involuntary show of interest had he understood\\nthem; but he remained mute and emotionless.\\n\\nWhile he took his sights with his sextant, one of the Nautilus’s\\nsailors—that muscular man who had gone with us to Crespo Island during\\nour first underwater excursion—came up to clean the glass panes of the\\nbeacon. I then examined the fittings of this mechanism, whose power\\nwas increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like\\nthose in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused. This\\nelectric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating\\npower. In essence, its light was generated in a vacuum, insuring both\\nits steadiness and intensity. Such a vacuum also reduced wear on the\\ngraphite points between which the luminous arc expanded. This was an\\nimportant savings for Captain Nemo, who couldn’t easily renew\\nthem. But under these conditions, wear and tear were almost\\nnonexistent.\\n\\nWhen the Nautilus was ready to resume its underwater travels, I went\\nbelow again to the lounge. The hatches closed once more, and our\\ncourse was set due west.\\n\\nWe then plowed the waves of the Indian Ocean, vast liquid plains with\\nan area of 550,000,000 hectares, whose waters are so transparent it\\nmakes you dizzy to lean over their surface. There the Nautilus\\ngenerally drifted at a depth between 100 and 200 meters. It behaved in\\nthis way for some days. To anyone without my grand passion for the\\nsea, these hours would surely have seemed long and monotonous; but my\\ndaily strolls on the platform where I was revived by the life-giving\\nocean air, the sights in the rich waters beyond the lounge windows,\\nthe books to be read in the library, and the composition of my\\nmemoirs, took up all my time and left me without a moment of weariness\\nor boredom.\\n\\nAll in all, we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health. The diet\\non board agreed with us perfectly, and for my part, I could easily\\nhave gone without those changes of pace that Ned Land, in a spirit of\\nprotest, kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us. What’s more, in this\\nconstant temperature we didn’t even have to worry about catching\\ncolds. Besides, the ship had a good stock of the madrepore\\nDendrophylia, known in Provence by the name sea fennel, and a poultice\\nmade from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent\\ncough medicine.\\n\\nFor some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet,\\nknown as gulls or sea mews. Some were skillfully slain, and when\\ncooked in a certain fashion, they make a very acceptable platter of\\nwater game. Among the great wind riders—carried over long distances\\nfrom every shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting\\nflights—I spotted some magnificent albatross, birds belonging to the\\nLongipennes (long-winged) family, whose discordant calls sound like\\nthe braying of an ass. The Totipalmes (fully webbed) family was\\nrepresented by swift frigate birds, nimbly catching fish at the\\nsurface, and by numerous tropic birds of the genus Phaeton, among\\nothers the red-tailed tropic bird, the size of a pigeon, its white\\nplumage shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark-hued\\nwings.\\n\\nThe Nautilus’s nets hauled up several types of sea turtle from the\\nhawksbill genus with arching backs whose scales are highly\\nprized. Diving easily, these reptiles can remain a good while\\nunderwater by closing the fleshy valves located at the external\\nopenings of their nasal passages. When they were captured, some\\nhawksbills were still asleep inside their carapaces, a refuge from\\nother marine animals. The flesh of these turtles was nothing\\nmemorable, but their eggs made an excellent feast.\\n\\nAs for fish, they always filled us with wonderment when, staring\\nthrough the open panels, we could unveil the secrets of their aquatic\\nlives. I noted several species I hadn’t previously been able to\\nobserve.\\n\\nI’ll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the Red Sea, the sea of\\nthe East Indies, and that part of the ocean washing the coasts of\\nequinoctial America. Like turtles, armadillos, sea urchins, and\\ncrustaceans, these fish are protected by armor plate that’s neither\\nchalky nor stony but actual bone. Sometimes this armor takes the shape\\nof a solid triangle, sometimes that of a solid quadrangle. Among the\\ntriangular type, I noticed some half a decimeter long, with brown\\ntails, yellow fins, and wholesome, exquisitely tasty flesh; I even\\nrecommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water, a change,\\nincidentally, that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease. I’ll\\nalso mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large\\nprotuberances along the back; trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on\\nthe underside of the body, which make good house pets like certain\\nbirds; boxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony\\ncrusts, and whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname “sea\\npigs”; then some trunkfish known as dromedaries, with tough, leathery\\nflesh and big conical humps.\\n\\nFrom the daily notes kept by Mr. Conseil, I also retrieve certain fish\\nfrom the genus Tetradon unique to these seas: southern puffers with\\nred backs and white chests distinguished by three lengthwise rows of\\nfilaments, and jugfish, seven inches long, decked out in the brightest\\ncolors. Then, as specimens of other genera, blowfish resembling a dark\\nbrown egg, furrowed with white bands, and lacking tails; globefish,\\ngenuine porcupines of the sea, armed with stings and able to inflate\\nthemselves until they look like a pin cushion bristling with needles;\\nseahorses common to every ocean; flying dragonfish with long snouts\\nand highly distended pectoral fins shaped like wings, which enable\\nthem, if not to fly, at least to spring into the air; spatula-shaped\\npaddlefish whose tails are covered with many scaly rings; snipefish\\nwith long jaws, excellent animals twenty-five centimeters long and\\ngleaming with the most cheerful colors; bluish gray dragonets with\\nwrinkled heads; myriads of leaping blennies with black stripes and\\nlong pectoral fins, gliding over the surface of the water with\\nprodigious speed; delicious sailfish that can hoist their fins in a\\nfavorable current like so many unfurled sails; splendid nurseryfish on\\nwhich nature has lavished yellow, azure, silver, and gold; yellow\\nmackerel with wings made of filaments; bullheads forever spattered\\nwith mud, which make distinct hissing sounds; sea robins whose livers\\nare thought to be poisonous; ladyfish that can flutter their eyelids;\\nfinally, archerfish with long, tubular snouts, real oceangoing\\nflycatchers, armed with a rifle unforeseen by either Remington or\\nChassepot: it slays insects by shooting them with a simple drop of\\nwater.\\n\\nFrom the eighty-ninth fish genus in Lacépède’s system of\\nclassification, belonging to his second subclass of bony fish\\n(characterized by gill covers and a bronchial membrane), I noted some\\nscorpionfish whose heads are adorned with stings and which have only\\none dorsal fin; these animals are covered with small scales, or have\\nnone at all, depending on the subgenus to which they belong. The\\nsecond subgenus gave us some Didactylus specimens three to four\\ndecimeters long, streaked with yellow, their heads having a\\nphantasmagoric appearance. As for the first subgenus, it furnished\\nseveral specimens of that bizarre fish aptly nicknamed “toadfish,”\\nwhose big head is sometimes gouged with deep cavities, sometimes\\nswollen with protuberances; bristling with stings and strewn with\\nnodules, it sports hideously irregular horns; its body and tail are\\nadorned with callosities; its stings can inflict dangerous injuries;\\nit’s repulsive and horrible.\\n\\nFrom January 21 to the 23rd, the Nautilus traveled at the rate of 250\\nleagues in twenty-four hours, hence 540 miles at twenty-two miles per\\nhour. If, during our trip, we were able to identify these different\\nvarieties of fish, it’s because they were attracted by our electric\\nlight and tried to follow alongside; but most of them were\\noutdistanced by our speed and soon fell behind; temporarily, however,\\na few managed to keep pace in the Nautilus’s waters.\\n\\nOn the morning of the 24th, in latitude 12 degrees 5’ south and\\nlongitude 94 degrees 33’, we raised Keeling Island, a madreporic\\nupheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees, which had been\\nvisited by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy. The Nautilus cruised along\\na short distance off the shore of this desert island. Our dragnets\\nbrought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms plus some unusual\\nshells from the branch Mollusca. Captain Nemo’s treasures were\\nenhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula snail species,\\nto which I joined some pointed star coral, a sort of parasitic\\npolypary that often attaches itself to seashells.\\n\\nSoon Keeling Island disappeared below the horizon, and our course was\\nset to the northwest, toward the tip of the Indian peninsula.\\n\\n“Civilization!” Ned Land told me that day. “Much better than those\\nPapuan Islands where we ran into more savages than venison! On this\\nIndian shore, professor, there are roads and railways, English,\\nFrench, and Hindu villages. We wouldn’t go five miles without bumping\\ninto a fellow countryman. Come on now, isn’t it time for our sudden\\ndeparture from Captain Nemo?”\\n\\n“No, no, Ned,” I replied in a very firm tone. “Let’s ride it out, as\\nyou seafaring fellows say. The Nautilus is approaching populated\\nareas. It’s going back toward Europe, let it take us there. After we\\narrive in home waters, we can do as we see fit. Besides, I don’t\\nimagine Captain Nemo will let us go hunting on the coasts of Malabar\\nor Coromandel as he did in the forests of New Guinea.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, can’t we manage without his permission?”\\n\\nI didn’t answer the Canadian. I wanted no arguments. Deep down, I was\\ndetermined to fully exploit the good fortune that had put me on board\\nthe Nautilus.\\n\\nAfter leaving Keeling Island, our pace got generally slower. It also\\ngot more unpredictable, often taking us to great depths. Several times\\nwe used our slanting fins, which internal levers could set at an\\noblique angle to our waterline. Thus we went as deep as two or three\\nkilometers down but without ever verifying the lowest depths of this\\nsea near India, which soundings of 13,000 meters have been unable to\\nreach. As for the temperature in these lower strata, the thermometer\\nalways and invariably indicated 4 degrees centigrade. I merely\\nobserved that in the upper layers, the water was always colder over\\nshallows than in the open sea.\\n\\nOn January 25, the ocean being completely deserted, the Nautilus spent\\nthe day on the surface, churning the waves with its powerful propeller\\nand making them spurt to great heights. Under these conditions, who\\nwouldn’t have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean? I spent\\nthree-quarters of the day on the platform. I stared at the\\nsea. Nothing on the horizon, except near four o’clock in the afternoon\\na long steamer to the west, running on our opposite tack. Its masting\\nwas visible for an instant, but it couldn’t have seen the Nautilus\\nbecause we were lying too low in the water. I imagine that steamboat\\nbelonged to the Peninsular & Oriental line, which provides service\\nfrom the island of Ceylon to Sidney, also calling at King George Sound\\nand Melbourne.\\n\\nAt five o’clock in the afternoon, just before that brief twilight that\\nlinks day with night in tropical zones, Conseil and I marveled at an\\nunusual sight.\\n\\nIt was a delightful animal whose discovery, according to the ancients,\\nis a sign of good luck. Aristotle, Athenaeus, Pliny, and Oppian\\nstudied its habits and lavished on its behalf all the scientific\\npoetry of Greece and Italy. They called it “nautilus” and “pompilius.”\\nBut modern science has not endorsed these designations, and this\\nmollusk is now known by the name argonaut.\\n\\nAnyone consulting Conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad that\\nthe branch Mollusca is divided into five classes; that the first class\\nfeatures the Cephalopoda (whose members are sometimes naked, sometimes\\ncovered with a shell), which consists of two families, the\\nDibranchiata and the Tetrabranchiata, which are distinguished by their\\nnumber of gills; that the family Dibranchiata includes three genera,\\nthe argonaut, the squid, and the cuttlefish, and that the family\\nTetrabranchiata contains only one genus, the nautilus. After this\\ncatalog, if some recalcitrant listener confuses the argonaut, which is\\nacetabuliferous (in other words, a bearer of suction tubes), with the\\nnautilus, which is tentaculiferous (a bearer of tentacles), it will be\\nsimply unforgivable.\\n\\nNow, it was a school of argonauts then voyaging on the surface of the\\nocean. We could count several hundred of them. They belonged to that\\nspecies of argonaut covered with protuberances and exclusive to the\\nseas near India.\\n\\nThese graceful mollusks were swimming backward by means of their\\nlocomotive tubes, sucking water into these tubes and then expelling\\nit. Six of their eight tentacles were long, thin, and floated on the\\nwater, while the other two were rounded into palms and spread to the\\nwind like light sails. I could see perfectly their undulating,\\nspiral-shaped shells, which Cuvier aptly compared to an elegant\\ncockleboat. It’s an actual boat indeed. It transports the animal that\\nsecretes it without the animal sticking to it.\\n\\n“The argonaut is free to leave its shell,” I told Conseil, “but it\\nnever does.”\\n\\n“Not unlike Captain Nemo,” Conseil replied sagely. “Which is why he\\nshould have christened his ship the Argonaut.”\\n\\nFor about an hour the Nautilus cruised in the midst of this school of\\nmollusks. Then, lord knows why, they were gripped with a sudden\\nfear. As if at a signal, every sail was abruptly lowered; arms folded,\\nbodies contracted, shells turned over by changing their center of\\ngravity, and the whole flotilla disappeared under the waves. It was\\ninstantaneous, and no squadron of ships ever maneuvered with greater\\ntogetherness.\\n\\nJust then night fell suddenly, and the waves barely surged in the\\nbreeze, spreading placidly around the Nautilus’s side plates.\\n\\nThe next day, January 26, we cut the equator on the 82nd meridian and\\nwe reentered the northern hemisphere.\\n\\nDuring that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an\\nescort. Dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them\\nextremely dangerous. There were Port Jackson sharks with a brown back,\\na whitish belly, and eleven rows of teeth, bigeye sharks with necks\\nmarked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye,\\nand Isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark\\nspeckles. Often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window\\nwith a violence less than comforting. By this point Ned Land had lost\\nall self-control. He wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and\\nharpoon the monsters, especially certain smooth-hound sharks whose\\nmouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic, and some big\\nfive-meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him. But\\nthe Nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest\\nof these man-eaters.\\n\\nOn January 27, at the entrance to the huge Bay of Bengal, we\\nrepeatedly encountered a gruesome sight: human corpses floating on the\\nsurface of the waves! Carried by the Ganges to the high seas, these\\nwere deceased Indian villagers who hadn’t been fully devoured by\\nvultures, the only morticians in these parts. But there was no\\nshortage of sharks to assist them with their undertaking chores.\\n\\nNear seven o’clock in the evening, the Nautilus lay half submerged,\\nnavigating in the midst of milky white waves. As far as the eye could\\nsee, the ocean seemed lactified. Was it an effect of the moon’s rays?\\nNo, because the new moon was barely two days old and was still lost\\nbelow the horizon in the sun’s rays. The entire sky, although lit up\\nby stellar radiation, seemed pitch-black in comparison with the\\nwhiteness of these waters.\\n\\nConseil couldn’t believe his eyes, and he questioned me about the\\ncauses of this odd phenomenon. Luckily I was in a position to answer\\nhim.\\n\\n“That’s called a milk sea,” I told him, “a vast expanse of white waves\\noften seen along the coasts of Amboina and in these waterways.”\\n\\n“But,” Conseil asked, “could master tell me the cause of this effect,\\nbecause I presume this water hasn’t really changed into milk!”\\n\\n“No, my boy, and this whiteness that amazes you is merely due to the\\npresence of myriads of tiny creatures called infusoria, a sort of\\ndiminutive glowworm that’s colorless and gelatinous in appearance, as\\nthick as a strand of hair, and no longer than one-fifth of a\\nmillimeter. Some of these tiny creatures stick together over an area\\nof several leagues.”\\n\\n“Several leagues!” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy, and don’t even try to compute the number of these\\ninfusoria. You won’t pull it off, because if I’m not mistaken, certain\\nnavigators have cruised through milk seas for more than forty miles.”\\n\\nI’m not sure that Conseil heeded my recommendation, because he seemed\\nto be deep in thought, no doubt trying to calculate how many\\none-fifths of a millimeter are found in forty square miles. As for me,\\nI continued to observe this phenomenon. For several hours the\\nNautilus’s spur sliced through these whitish waves, and I watched it\\nglide noiselessly over this soapy water, as if it were cruising\\nthrough those foaming eddies that a bay’s currents and countercurrents\\nsometimes leave between each other.\\n\\nNear midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue, but behind us\\nall the way to the horizon, the skies kept mirroring the whiteness of\\nthose waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy glow of\\nan aurora borealis.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\nA New Proposition from Captain Nemo\\n\\n\\nON JANUARY 28, in latitude 9 degrees 4’ north, when the Nautilus\\nreturned at noon to the surface of the sea, it lay in sight of land\\nsome eight miles to the west. Right off, I observed a cluster of\\nmountains about 2,000 feet high, whose shapes were very whimsically\\nsculpted. After our position fix, I reentered the lounge, and when our\\nbearings were reported on the chart, I saw that we were off the island\\nof Ceylon, that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the Indian\\npeninsula.\\n\\nI went looking in the library for a book about this island, one of the\\nmost fertile in the world. Sure enough, I found a volume entitled\\nCeylon and the Singhalese by H. C. Sirr, Esq. Reentering the lounge, I\\nfirst noted the bearings of Ceylon, on which antiquity lavished so\\nmany different names. It was located between latitude 5 degrees 55’\\nand 9 degrees 49’ north, and between longitude 79 degrees 42’ and 82\\ndegrees 4’ east of the meridian of Greenwich; its length is 275 miles;\\nits maximum width, 150 miles; its circumference, 900 miles; its\\nsurface area, 24,448 square miles, in other words, a little smaller\\nthan that of Ireland.\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo and his chief officer appeared.\\n\\nThe captain glanced at the chart. Then, turning to me:\\n\\n“The island of Ceylon,” he said, “is famous for its pearl\\nfisheries. Would you be interested, Professor Aronnax, in visiting one\\nof those fisheries?”\\n\\n“Certainly, captain.”\\n\\n“Fine. It’s easily done. Only, when we see the fisheries, we’ll see no\\nfishermen. The annual harvest hasn’t yet begun. No matter. I’ll give\\norders to make for the Gulf of Mannar, and we’ll arrive there late\\ntonight.”\\n\\nThe captain said a few words to his chief officer who went out\\nimmediately. Soon the Nautilus reentered its liquid element, and the\\npressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty\\nfeet.\\n\\nWith the chart under my eyes, I looked for the Gulf of Mannar. I found\\nit by the 9th parallel off the northwestern shores of Ceylon. It was\\nformed by the long curve of little Mannar Island. To reach it we had\\nto go all the way up Ceylon’s west coast.\\n\\n“Professor,” Captain Nemo then told me, “there are pearl fisheries in\\nthe Bay of Bengal, the seas of the East Indies, the seas of China and\\nJapan, plus those seas south of the United States, the Gulf of Panama\\nand the Gulf of California; but it’s off Ceylon that such fishing\\nreaps its richest rewards. No doubt we’ll be arriving a little\\nearly. Fishermen gather in the Gulf of Mannar only during the month of\\nMarch, and for thirty days some 300 boats concentrate on the lucrative\\nharvest of these treasures from the sea. Each boat is manned by ten\\noarsmen and ten fishermen. The latter divide into two groups, dive in\\nrotation, and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a\\nheavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to\\ntheir boat.”\\n\\n“You mean,” I said, “that such primitive methods are still all that\\nthey use?”\\n\\n“All,” Captain Nemo answered me, “although these fisheries belong to\\nthe most industrialized people in the world, the English, to whom the\\nTreaty of Amiens granted them in 1802.”\\n\\n“Yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman\\nservice in such work.”\\n\\n“Yes, since those poor fishermen can’t stay long underwater. On his\\nvoyage to Ceylon, the Englishman Percival made much of a Kaffir who\\nstayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface, but I find\\nthat hard to believe. I know that some divers can last up to\\nfifty-seven seconds, and highly skillful ones to eighty-seven; but\\nsuch men are rare, and when the poor fellows climb back on board, the\\nwater coming out of their noses and ears is tinted with blood. I\\nbelieve the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate\\nis thirty seconds, during which they hastily stuff their little nets\\nwith all the pearl oysters they can tear loose. But these fishermen\\ngenerally don’t live to advanced age: their vision weakens, ulcers\\nbreak out on their eyes, sores form on their bodies, and some are even\\nstricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor.”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “it’s a sad occupation, and one that exists only to\\ngratify the whims of fashion. But tell me, captain, how many oysters\\ncan a boat fish up in a workday?”\\n\\n“About 40,000 to 50,000. It’s even said that in 1814, when the English\\ngovernment went fishing on its own behalf, its divers worked just\\ntwenty days and brought up 76,000,000 oysters.”\\n\\n“At least,” I asked, “the fishermen are well paid, aren’t they?”\\n\\n“Hardly, professor. In Panama they make just $1.00 per week. In most\\nplaces they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl, and\\nthey bring up so many that have none!”\\n\\n“Only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich!\\nThat’s atrocious!”\\n\\n“On that note, professor,” Captain Nemo told me, “you and your\\ncompanions will visit the Mannar oysterbank, and if by chance some\\neager fisherman arrives early, well, we can watch him at work.”\\n\\n“That suits me, captain.”\\n\\n“By the way, Professor Aronnax, you aren’t afraid of sharks, are you?”\\n\\n“Sharks?” I exclaimed.\\n\\nThis struck me as a pretty needless question, to say the least.\\n\\n“Well?” Captain Nemo went on.\\n\\n“I admit, captain, I’m not yet on very familiar terms with that genus\\nof fish.”\\n\\n“We’re used to them, the rest of us,” Captain Nemo answered. “And in\\ntime you will be too. Anyhow, we’ll be armed, and on our way we might\\nhunt a man-eater or two. It’s a fascinating sport. So, professor, I’ll\\nsee you tomorrow, bright and early.”\\n\\nThis said in a carefree tone, Captain Nemo left the lounge.\\n\\nIf you’re invited to hunt bears in the Swiss mountains, you might say:\\n“Oh good, I get to go bear hunting tomorrow!” If you’re invited to\\nhunt lions on the Atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of India, you\\nmight say: “Ha! Now’s my chance to hunt lions and tigers!” But if\\nyou’re invited to hunt sharks in their native element, you might want\\nto think it over before accepting.\\n\\nAs for me, I passed a hand over my brow, where beads of cold sweat\\nwere busy forming.\\n\\n“Let’s think this over,” I said to myself, “and let’s take our\\ntime. Hunting otters in underwater forests, as we did in the forests\\nof Crespo Island, is an acceptable activity. But to roam the bottom of\\nthe sea when you’re almost certain to meet man-eaters in the\\nneighborhood, that’s another story! I know that in certain countries,\\nparticularly the Andaman Islands, Negroes don’t hesitate to attack\\nsharks, dagger in one hand and noose in the other; but I also know\\nthat many who face those fearsome animals don’t come back\\nalive. Besides, I’m not a Negro, and even if I were a Negro, in this\\ninstance I don’t think a little hesitation on my part would be out of\\nplace.”\\n\\nAnd there I was, fantasizing about sharks, envisioning huge jaws armed\\nwith multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half. I\\ncould already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle. And how I\\nresented the offhand manner in which the captain had extended his\\ndeplorable invitation! You would have thought it was an issue of going\\ninto the woods on some harmless fox hunt!\\n\\n“Thank heavens!” I said to myself. “Conseil will never want to come\\nalong, and that’ll be my excuse for not going with the captain.”\\n\\nAs for Ned Land, I admit I felt less confident of his wisdom. Danger,\\nhowever great, held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature.\\n\\nI went back to reading Sirr’s book, but I leafed through it\\nmechanically. Between the lines I kept seeing fearsome, wide-open\\njaws.\\n\\nJust then Conseil and the Canadian entered with a calm, even gleeful\\nair. Little did they know what was waiting for them.\\n\\n“Ye gods, sir!” Ned Land told me. “Your Captain Nemo—the devil take\\nhim—has just made us a very pleasant proposition!”\\n\\n“Oh!” I said “You know about—”\\n\\n“With all due respect to master,” Conseil replied, “the Nautilus’s\\ncommander has invited us, together with master, for a visit tomorrow\\nto Ceylon’s magnificent pearl fisheries. He did so in the most cordial\\nterms and conducted himself like a true gentleman.”\\n\\n“He didn’t tell you anything else?”\\n\\n“Nothing, sir,” the Canadian replied. “He said you’d already discussed\\nthis little stroll.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” I said. “But didn’t he give you any details on—”\\n\\n“Not a one, Mr. Naturalist. You will be going with us, right?”\\n\\n“Me? Why yes, certainly, of course! I can see that you like the idea,\\nMr. Land.”\\n\\n“Yes! It will be a really unusual experience!”\\n\\n“And possibly dangerous!” I added in an insinuating tone.\\n\\n“Dangerous?” Ned Land replied. “A simple trip to an oysterbank?”\\n\\nAssuredly, Captain Nemo hadn’t seen fit to plant the idea of sharks in\\nthe minds of my companions. For my part, I stared at them with anxious\\neyes, as if they were already missing a limb or two. Should I alert\\nthem? Yes, surely, but I hardly knew how to go about it.\\n\\n“Would master,” Conseil said to me, “give us some background on pearl\\nfishing?”\\n\\n“On the fishing itself?” I asked. “Or on the occupational hazards\\nthat—”\\n\\n“On the fishing,” the Canadian replied. “Before we tackle the terrain,\\nit helps to be familiar with it.”\\n\\n“All right, sit down, my friends, and I’ll teach you everything I\\nmyself have just been taught by the Englishman H. C. Sirr!”\\n\\nNed and Conseil took seats on a couch, and right off the Canadian said\\nto me:\\n\\n“Sir, just what is a pearl exactly?”\\n\\n“My gallant Ned,” I replied, “for poets a pearl is a tear from the\\nsea; for Orientals it’s a drop of solidified dew; for the ladies it’s\\na jewel they can wear on their fingers, necks, and ears that’s oblong\\nin shape, glassy in luster, and formed from mother-of-pearl; for\\nchemists it’s a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate\\nwith a little gelatin protein; and finally, for naturalists it’s a\\nsimple festering secretion from the organ that produces\\nmother-of-pearl in certain bivalves.”\\n\\n“Branch Mollusca,” Conseil said, “class Acephala, order Testacea.”\\n\\n“Correct, my scholarly Conseil. Now then, those Testacea capable of\\nproducing pearls include rainbow abalone, turbo snails, giant clams,\\nand saltwater scallops—briefly, all those that secrete\\nmother-of-pearl, in other words, that blue, azure, violet, or white\\nsubstance lining the insides of their valves.”\\n\\n“Are mussels included too?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“Yes! The mussels of certain streams in Scotland, Wales, Ireland,\\nSaxony, Bohemia, and France.”\\n\\n“Good!” the Canadian replied. “From now on we’ll pay closer attention\\nto ‘em.”\\n\\n“But,” I went on, “for secreting pearls, the ideal mollusk is the\\npearl oyster Meleagrina margaritifera, that valuable shellfish. Pearls\\nresult simply from mother-of-pearl solidifying into a globular\\nshape. Either they stick to the oyster’s shell, or they become\\nembedded in the creature’s folds. On the valves a pearl sticks fast;\\non the flesh it lies loose. But its nucleus is always some small, hard\\nobject, say a sterile egg or a grain of sand, around which the\\nmother-of-pearl is deposited in thin, concentric layers over several\\nyears in succession.”\\n\\n“Can one find several pearls in the same oyster?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy. There are some shellfish that turn into real jewel\\ncoffers. They even mention one oyster, about which I remain dubious,\\nthat supposedly contained at least 150 sharks.”\\n\\n“150 sharks!” Ned Land yelped.\\n\\n“Did I say sharks?” I exclaimed hastily. “I meant 150 pearls. Sharks\\nwouldn’t make sense.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” Conseil said. “But will master now tell us how one goes\\nabout extracting these pearls?”\\n\\n“One proceeds in several ways, and often when pearls stick to the\\nvalves, fishermen even pull them loose with pliers. But usually the\\nshellfish are spread out on mats made from the esparto grass that\\ncovers the beaches. Thus they die in the open air, and by the end of\\nten days they’ve rotted sufficiently. Next they’re immersed in huge\\ntanks of salt water, then they’re opened up and washed. At this point\\nthe sorters begin their twofold task. First they remove the layers of\\nmother-of-pearl, which are known in the industry by the names\\nlegitimate silver, bastard white, or bastard black, and these are\\nshipped out in cases weighing 125 to 150 kilograms. Then they remove\\nthe oyster’s meaty tissue, boil it, and finally strain it, in order to\\nextract even the smallest pearls.”\\n\\n“Do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size?”\\nConseil asked.\\n\\n“Not only on their size,” I replied, “but also according to their\\nshape, their water—in other words, their color—and their orient—in\\nother words, that dappled, shimmering glow that makes them so\\ndelightful to the eye. The finest pearls are called virgin pearls, or\\nparagons; they form in isolation within the mollusk’s tissue. They’re\\nwhite, often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency, and\\nusually spherical or pear-shaped. The spherical ones are made into\\nbracelets; the pear-shaped ones into earrings, and since they’re the\\nmost valuable, they’re priced individually. The other pearls that\\nstick to the oyster’s shell are more erratically shaped and are priced\\nby weight. Finally, classed in the lowest order, the smallest pearls\\nare known by the name seed pearls; they’re priced by the measuring cup\\nand are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church\\nvestments.”\\n\\n“But it must be a long, hard job, sorting out these pearls by size,”\\nthe Canadian said.\\n\\n“No, my friend. That task is performed with eleven strainers, or\\nsieves, that are pierced with different numbers of holes. Those pearls\\nstaying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes are in the first\\norder. Those not slipping through the sieves pierced with 100 to 800\\nholes are in the second order. Finally, those pearls for which one\\nuses strainers pierced with 900 to 1,000 holes make up the seed\\npearls.”\\n\\n“How ingenious,” Conseil said, “to reduce dividing and classifying\\npearls to a mechanical operation. And could master tell us the profits\\nbrought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters?”\\n\\n“According to Sirr’s book,” I replied, “these Ceylon fisheries are\\nfarmed annually for a total profit of 3,000,000 man-eaters.”\\n\\n“Francs!” Conseil rebuked.\\n\\n“Yes, francs! 3,000,000 francs!” I went on. “But I don’t think these\\nfisheries bring in the returns they once did. Similarly, the Central\\nAmerican fisheries used to make an annual profit of 4,000,000 francs\\nduring the reign of King Charles V, but now they bring in only\\ntwo-thirds of that amount. All in all, it’s estimated that 9,000,000\\nfrancs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl-harvesting\\nindustry.”\\n\\n“But,” Conseil asked, “haven’t certain famous pearls been quoted at\\nextremely high prices?”\\n\\n“Yes, my boy. They say Julius Caesar gave Servilia a pearl worth\\n120,000 francs in our currency.”\\n\\n“I’ve even heard stories,” the Canadian said, “about some lady in\\nancient times who drank pearls in vinegar.”\\n\\n“Cleopatra,” Conseil shot back.\\n\\n“It must have tasted pretty bad,” Ned Land added.\\n\\n“Abominable, Ned my friend,” Conseil replied. “But when a little glass\\nof vinegar is worth 1,500,000 francs, its taste is a small price to\\npay.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry I didn’t marry the gal,” the Canadian said, throwing up his\\nhands with an air of discouragement.\\n\\n“Ned Land married to Cleopatra?” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“But I was all set to tie the knot, Conseil,” the Canadian replied in\\nall seriousness, “and it wasn’t my fault the whole business fell\\nthrough. I even bought a pearl necklace for my fiancΘe, Kate Tender,\\nbut she married somebody else instead. Well, that necklace cost me\\nonly $1.50, but you can absolutely trust me on this, professor, its\\npearls were so big, they wouldn’t have gone through that strainer with\\ntwenty holes.”\\n\\n“My gallant Ned,” I replied, laughing, “those were artificial pearls,\\nordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with Essence of\\nOrient.”\\n\\n“Wow!” the Canadian replied. “That Essence of Orient must sell for\\nquite a large sum.”\\n\\n“As little as zero! It comes from the scales of a European carp, it’s\\nnothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is\\npreserved in ammonia. It’s worthless.”\\n\\n“Maybe that’s why Kate Tender married somebody else,” replied Mr. Land\\nphilosophically.\\n\\n“But,” I said, “getting back to pearls of great value, I don’t think\\nany sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by\\nCaptain Nemo.”\\n\\n“This one?” Conseil said, pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass\\ncase.\\n\\n“Exactly. And I’m certainly not far off when I estimate its value at\\n2,000,000 . . . uh . . .”\\n\\n“Francs!” Conseil said quickly.\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “2,000,000 francs, and no doubt all it cost our captain\\nwas the effort to pick it up.”\\n\\n“Ha!” Ned Land exclaimed. “During our stroll tomorrow, who says we\\nwon’t run into one just like it?”\\n\\n“Bah!” Conseil put in.\\n\\n“And why not?”\\n\\n“What good would a pearl worth millions do us here on the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“Here, no,” Ned Land said. “But elsewhere. . . .”\\n\\n“Oh! Elsewhere!” Conseil put in, shaking his head.\\n\\n“In fact,” I said, “Mr. Land is right. And if we ever brought back to\\nEurope or America a pearl worth millions, it would make the story of\\nour adventures more authentic—and much more rewarding.”\\n\\n“That’s how I see it,” the Canadian said.\\n\\n“But,” said Conseil, who perpetually returned to the didactic side of\\nthings, “is this pearl fishing ever dangerous?”\\n\\n“No,” I replied quickly, “especially if one takes certain\\nprecautions.”\\n\\n“What risks would you run in a job like that?” Ned Land\\nsaid. “Swallowing a few gulps of salt water?”\\n\\n“Whatever you say, Ned.” Then, trying to imitate Captain Nemo’s\\ncarefree tone, I asked, “By the way, gallant Ned, are you afraid of\\nsharks?”\\n\\n“Me?” the Canadian replied. “I’m a professional harpooner! It’s my job\\nto make a mockery of them!”\\n\\n“It isn’t an issue,” I said, “of fishing for them with a swivel hook,\\nhoisting them onto the deck of a ship, chopping off the tail with a\\nsweep of the ax, opening the belly, ripping out the heart, and tossing\\nit into the sea.”\\n\\n“So it’s an issue of . . . ?”\\n\\n“Yes, precisely.”\\n\\n“In the water?”\\n\\n“In the water.”\\n\\n“Ye gods, just give me a good harpoon! You see, sir, these sharks are\\nbadly designed. They have to roll their bellies over to snap you up,\\nand in the meantime . . .”\\n\\nNed Land had a way of pronouncing the word “snap” that sent chills\\ndown the spine.\\n\\n“Well, how about you, Conseil? What are your feelings about these\\nman-eaters?”\\n\\n“Me?” Conseil said. “I’m afraid I must be frank with master.”\\n\\nGood for you, I thought.\\n\\n“If master faces these sharks,” Conseil said, “I think his loyal\\nmanservant should face them with him!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\nA Pearl Worth Ten Million\\n\\n\\nNIGHT FELL. I went to bed. I slept pretty poorly. Man-eaters played a\\nmajor role in my dreams. And I found it more or less appropriate that\\nthe French word for shark, requin, has its linguistic roots in the\\nword requiem.\\n\\nThe next day at four o’clock in the morning, I was awakened by the\\nsteward whom Captain Nemo had placed expressly at my service. I got up\\nquickly, dressed, and went into the lounge.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was waiting for me.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he said to me, “are you ready to start?”\\n\\n“I’m ready.”\\n\\n“Kindly follow me.”\\n\\n“What about my companions, captain?”\\n\\n“They’ve been alerted and are waiting for us.”\\n\\n“Aren’t we going to put on our diving suits?” I asked.\\n\\n“Not yet. I haven’t let the Nautilus pull too near the coast, and\\nwe’re fairly well out from the Mannar oysterbank. But I have the skiff\\nready, and it will take us to the exact spot where we’ll disembark,\\nwhich will save us a pretty long trek. It’s carrying our diving\\nequipment, and we’ll suit up just before we begin our underwater\\nexploring.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo took me to the central companionway whose steps led to\\nthe platform. Ned and Conseil were there, enraptured with the\\n“pleasure trip” getting under way. Oars in position, five of the\\nNautilus’s sailors were waiting for us aboard the skiff, which was\\nmoored alongside. The night was still dark. Layers of clouds cloaked\\nthe sky and left only a few stars in view. My eyes flew to the side\\nwhere land lay, but I saw only a blurred line covering three-quarters\\nof the horizon from southwest to northwest. Going up Ceylon’s west\\ncoast during the night, the Nautilus lay west of the bay, or rather\\nthat gulf formed by the mainland and Mannar Island. Under these dark\\nwaters there stretched the bank of shellfish, an inexhaustible field\\nof pearls more than twenty miles long.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo, Conseil, Ned Land, and I found seats in the stern of the\\nskiff. The longboat’s coxswain took the tiller; his four companions\\nleaned into their oars; the moorings were cast off and we pulled\\nclear.\\n\\nThe skiff headed southward. The oarsmen took their time. I watched\\ntheir strokes vigorously catch the water, and they always waited ten\\nseconds before rowing again, following the practice used in most\\nnavies. While the longboat coasted, drops of liquid flicked from the\\noars and hit the dark troughs of the waves, pitter-pattering like\\nsplashes of molten lead. Coming from well out, a mild swell made the\\nskiff roll gently, and a few cresting billows lapped at its bow.\\n\\nWe were silent. What was Captain Nemo thinking? Perhaps that this\\napproaching shore was too close for comfort, contrary to the\\nCanadian’s views in which it still seemed too far away. As for\\nConseil, he had come along out of simple curiosity.\\n\\nNear 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper\\nlines of the coast with greater distinctness. Fairly flat to the east,\\nit swelled a little toward the south. Five miles still separated it\\nfrom us, and its beach merged with the misty waters. Between us and\\nthe shore, the sea was deserted. Not a boat, not a diver. Profound\\nsolitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen. As\\nCaptain Nemo had commented, we were arriving in these waterways a\\nmonth too soon.\\n\\nAt six o’clock the day broke suddenly, with that speed unique to\\ntropical regions, which experience no real dawn or dusk. The sun’s\\nrays pierced the cloud curtain gathered on the easterly horizon, and\\nthe radiant orb rose swiftly.\\n\\nI could clearly see the shore, which featured a few sparse trees here\\nand there.\\n\\nThe skiff advanced toward Mannar Island, which curved to the\\nsouth. Captain Nemo stood up from his thwart and studied the sea.\\n\\nAt his signal the anchor was lowered, but its chain barely ran because\\nthe bottom lay no more than a meter down, and this locality was one of\\nthe shallowest spots near the bank of shellfish. Instantly the skiff\\nwheeled around under the ebb tide’s outbound thrust.\\n\\n“Here we are, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo then said. “You observe\\nthis confined bay? A month from now in this very place, the numerous\\nfishing boats of the harvesters will gather, and these are the waters\\ntheir divers will ransack so daringly. This bay is felicitously laid\\nout for their type of fishing. It’s sheltered from the strongest\\nwinds, and the sea is never very turbulent here, highly favorable\\nconditions for diving work. Now let’s put on our underwater suits, and\\nwe’ll begin our stroll.”\\n\\nI didn’t reply, and while staring at these suspicious waves, I began\\nto put on my heavy aquatic clothes, helped by the longboat’s\\nsailors. Captain Nemo and my two companions suited up as well. None of\\nthe Nautilus’s men were to go with us on this new excursion.\\n\\nSoon we were imprisoned up to the neck in india-rubber clothing, and\\nstraps fastened the air devices onto our backs. As for the Ruhmkorff\\ndevice, it didn’t seem to be in the picture. Before inserting my head\\ninto its copper capsule, I commented on this to the captain.\\n\\n“Our lighting equipment would be useless to us,” the captain answered\\nme. “We won’t be going very deep, and the sun’s rays will be\\nsufficient to light our way. Besides, it’s unwise to carry electric\\nlanterns under these waves. Their brightness might unexpectedly\\nattract certain dangerous occupants of these waterways.”\\n\\nAs Captain Nemo pronounced these words, I turned to Conseil and Ned\\nLand. But my two friends had already encased their craniums in their\\nmetal headgear, and they could neither hear nor reply.\\n\\nI had one question left to address to Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“What about our weapons?” I asked him. “Our rifles?”\\n\\n“Rifles! What for? Don’t your mountaineers attack bears dagger in\\nhand? And isn’t steel surer than lead? Here’s a sturdy blade. Slip it\\nunder your belt and let’s be off.”\\n\\nI stared at my companions. They were armed in the same fashion, and\\nNed Land was also brandishing an enormous harpoon he had stowed in the\\nskiff before leaving the Nautilus.\\n\\nThen, following the captain’s example, I let myself be crowned with my\\nheavy copper sphere, and our air tanks immediately went into action.\\n\\nAn instant later, the longboat’s sailors helped us overboard one after\\nthe other, and we set foot on level sand in a meter and a half of\\nwater. Captain Nemo gave us a hand signal. We followed him down a\\ngentle slope and disappeared under the waves.\\n\\nThere the obsessive fears in my brain left me. I became surprisingly\\ncalm again. The ease with which I could move increased my confidence,\\nand the many strange sights captivated my imagination.\\n\\nThe sun was already sending sufficient light under these waves. The\\ntiniest objects remained visible. After ten minutes of walking, we\\nwere in five meters of water, and the terrain had become almost flat.\\n\\nLike a covey of snipe over a marsh, there rose underfoot schools of\\nunusual fish from the genus Monopterus, whose members have no fin but\\ntheir tail. I recognized the Javanese eel, a genuine eight-decimeter\\nserpent with a bluish gray belly, which, without the gold lines over\\nits flanks, could easily be confused with the conger eel. From the\\nbutterfish genus, whose oval bodies are very flat, I observed several\\nadorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle,\\nedible fish that, when dried and marinated, make an excellent dish\\nknown by the name “karawade”; then some sea poachers, fish belonging\\nto the genus Aspidophoroides, whose bodies are covered with scaly\\narmor divided into eight lengthwise sections.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as the sun got progressively higher, it lit up the watery\\nmass more and more. The seafloor changed little by little. Its\\nfine-grained sand was followed by a genuine causeway of smooth crags\\ncovered by a carpet of mollusks and zoophytes. Among other specimens\\nin these two branches, I noted some windowpane oysters with thin\\nvalves of unequal size, a type of ostracod unique to the Red Sea and\\nthe Indian Ocean, then orange-hued lucina with circular shells,\\nawl-shaped auger shells, some of those Persian murex snails that\\nsupply the Nautilus with such wonderful dye, spiky periwinkles fifteen\\ncentimeters long that rose under the waves like hands ready to grab\\nyou, turban snails with shells made of horn and bristling all over\\nwith spines, lamp shells, edible duck clams that feed the Hindu\\nmarketplace, subtly luminous jellyfish of the species Pelagia\\npanopyra, and finally some wonderful Oculina flabelliforma,\\nmagnificent sea fans that fashion one of the most luxuriant tree forms\\nin this ocean.\\n\\nIn the midst of this moving vegetation, under arbors of water plants,\\nthere raced legions of clumsy articulates, in particular some fanged\\nfrog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle, robber\\ncrabs exclusive to these waterways, and horrible parthenope crabs\\nwhose appearance was repulsive to the eye. One animal no less hideous,\\nwhich I encountered several times, was the enormous crab that\\nMr. Darwin observed, to which nature has given the instinct and\\nrequisite strength to eat coconuts; it scrambles up trees on the beach\\nand sends the coconuts tumbling; they fracture in their fall and are\\nopened by its powerful pincers. Here, under these clear waves, this\\ncrab raced around with matchless agility, while green turtles from the\\nspecies frequenting the Malabar coast moved sluggishly among the\\ncrumbling rocks.\\n\\nNear seven o’clock we finally surveyed the bank of shellfish, where\\npearl oysters reproduce by the millions. These valuable mollusks stick\\nto rocks, where they’re strongly attached by a mass of brown filaments\\nthat forbids their moving about. In this respect oysters are inferior\\neven to mussels, to whom nature has not denied all talent for\\nlocomotion.\\n\\nThe shellfish Meleagrina, that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly\\nequal in size, has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a\\nvery rough exterior. Some of these shells were furrowed with flaky,\\ngreenish bands that radiated down from the top. These were the young\\noysters. The others had rugged black surfaces, measured up to fifteen\\ncentimeters in width, and were ten or more years old.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo pointed to this prodigious heap of shellfish, and I saw\\nthat these mines were genuinely inexhaustible, since nature’s creative\\npowers are greater than man’s destructive instincts. True to those\\ninstincts, Ned Land greedily stuffed the finest of these mollusks into\\na net he carried at his side.\\n\\nBut we couldn’t stop. We had to follow the captain, who headed down\\ntrails seemingly known only to himself. The seafloor rose noticeably,\\nand when I lifted my arms, sometimes they would pass above the surface\\nof the sea. Then the level of the oysterbank would lower\\nunpredictably. Often we went around tall, pointed rocks rising like\\npyramids. In their dark crevices huge crustaceans, aiming their long\\nlegs like heavy artillery, watched us with unblinking eyes, while\\nunderfoot there crept millipedes, bloodworms, aricia worms, and\\nannelid worms, whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly\\nlong.\\n\\nJust then a huge cave opened up in our path, hollowed from a\\npicturesque pile of rocks whose smooth heights were completely hung\\nwith underwater flora. At first this cave looked pitch-black to\\nme. Inside, the sun’s rays seemed to diminish by degrees. Their hazy\\ntransparency was nothing more than drowned light.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo went in. We followed him. My eyes soon grew accustomed to\\nthis comparative gloom. I distinguished the unpredictably contoured\\nspringings of a vault, supported by natural pillars firmly based on a\\ngranite foundation, like the weighty columns of Tuscan\\narchitecture. Why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the\\ndepths of this underwater crypt? I would soon find out.\\n\\nAfter going down a fairly steep slope, our feet trod the floor of a\\nsort of circular pit. There Captain Nemo stopped, and his hand\\nindicated an object that I hadn’t yet noticed.\\n\\nIt was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a titanic giant clam, a\\nholy-water font that could have held a whole lake, a basin more than\\ntwo meters wide, hence even bigger than the one adorning the\\nNautilus’s lounge.\\n\\nI approached this phenomenal mollusk. Its mass of filaments attached\\nit to a table of granite, and there it grew by itself in the midst of\\nthe cave’s calm waters. I estimated the weight of this giant clam at\\n300 kilograms. Hence such an oyster held fifteen kilos of meat, and\\nyou’d need the stomach of King Gargantua to eat a couple dozen.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was obviously familiar with this bivalve’s\\nexistence. This wasn’t the first time he’d paid it a visit, and I\\nthought his sole reason for leading us to this locality was to show us\\na natural curiosity. I was mistaken. Captain Nemo had an explicit\\npersonal interest in checking on the current condition of this giant\\nclam.\\n\\nThe mollusk’s two valves were partly open. The captain approached and\\nstuck his dagger vertically between the shells to discourage any ideas\\nabout closing; then with his hands he raised the fringed,\\nmembrane-filled tunic that made up the animal’s mantle.\\n\\nThere, between its leaflike folds, I saw a loose pearl as big as a\\ncoconut. Its globular shape, perfect clarity, and wonderful orient\\nmade it a jewel of incalculable value. Carried away by curiosity, I\\nstretched out my hand to take it, weigh it, fondle it! But the captain\\nstopped me, signaled no, removed his dagger in one swift motion, and\\nlet the two valves snap shut.\\n\\nI then understood Captain Nemo’s intent. By leaving the pearl buried\\nbeneath the giant clam’s mantle, he allowed it to grow\\nimperceptibly. With each passing year the mollusk’s secretions added\\nnew concentric layers. The captain alone was familiar with the cave\\nwhere this wonderful fruit of nature was “ripening”; he alone reared\\nit, so to speak, in order to transfer it one day to his dearly beloved\\nmuseum. Perhaps, following the examples of oyster farmers in China and\\nIndia, he had even predetermined the creation of this pearl by\\nsticking under the mollusk’s folds some piece of glass or metal that\\nwas gradually covered with mother-of-pearl. In any case, comparing\\nthis pearl to others I already knew about, and to those shimmering in\\nthe captain’s collection, I estimated that it was worth at least\\n10,000,000 francs. It was a superb natural curiosity rather than a\\nluxurious piece of jewelry, because I don’t know of any female ear\\nthat could handle it.\\n\\nOur visit to this opulent giant clam came to an end. Captain Nemo left\\nthe cave, and we climbed back up the bank of shellfish in the midst of\\nthese clear waters not yet disturbed by divers at work.\\n\\nWe walked by ourselves, genuine loiterers stopping or straying as our\\nfancies dictated. For my part, I was no longer worried about those\\ndangers my imagination had so ridiculously exaggerated. The shallows\\ndrew noticeably closer to the surface of the sea, and soon, walking in\\nonly a meter of water, my head passed well above the level of the\\nocean. Conseil rejoined me, and gluing his huge copper capsule to\\nmine, his eyes gave me a friendly greeting. But this lofty plateau\\nmeasured only a few fathoms, and soon we reentered Our Element. I\\nthink I’ve now earned the right to dub it that.\\n\\nTen minutes later, Captain Nemo stopped suddenly. I thought he’d\\ncalled a halt so that we could turn and start back. No. With a gesture\\nhe ordered us to crouch beside him at the foot of a wide crevice. His\\nhand motioned toward a spot within the liquid mass, and I looked\\ncarefully.\\n\\nFive meters away a shadow appeared and dropped to the seafloor. The\\nalarming idea of sharks crossed my mind. But I was mistaken, and once\\nagain we didn’t have to deal with monsters of the deep.\\n\\nIt was a man, a living man, a black Indian fisherman, a poor devil who\\nno doubt had come to gather what he could before harvest time. I saw\\nthe bottom of his dinghy, moored a few feet above his head. He would\\ndive and go back up in quick succession. A stone cut in the shape of a\\nsugar loaf, which he gripped between his feet while a rope connected\\nit to his boat, served to lower him more quickly to the ocean\\nfloor. This was the extent of his equipment. Arriving on the seafloor\\nat a depth of about five meters, he fell to his knees and stuffed his\\nsack with shellfish gathered at random. Then he went back up, emptied\\nhis sack, pulled up his stone, and started all over again, the whole\\nprocess lasting only thirty seconds.\\n\\nThis diver didn’t see us. A shadow cast by our crag hid us from his\\nview. And besides, how could this poor Indian ever have guessed that\\nhuman beings, creatures like himself, were near him under the waters,\\neavesdropping on his movements, not missing a single detail of his\\nfishing!\\n\\nSo he went up and down several times. He gathered only about ten\\nshellfish per dive, because he had to tear them from the banks where\\neach clung with its tough mass of filaments. And how many of these\\noysters for which he risked his life would have no pearl in them!\\n\\nI observed him with great care. His movements were systematically\\nexecuted, and for half an hour no danger seemed to threaten him. So I\\nhad gotten used to the sight of this fascinating fishing when all at\\nonce, just as the Indian was kneeling on the seafloor, I saw him make\\na frightened gesture, stand, and gather himself to spring back to the\\nsurface of the waves.\\n\\nI understood his fear. A gigantic shadow appeared above the poor\\ndiver. It was a shark of huge size, moving in diagonally, eyes ablaze,\\njaws wide open!\\n\\nI was speechless with horror, unable to make a single movement.\\n\\nWith one vigorous stroke of its fins, the voracious animal shot toward\\nthe Indian, who jumped aside and avoided the shark’s bite but not the\\nthrashing of its tail, because that tail struck him across the chest\\nand stretched him out on the seafloor.\\n\\nThis scene lasted barely a few seconds. The shark returned, rolled\\nover on its back, and was getting ready to cut the Indian in half,\\nwhen Captain Nemo, who was stationed beside me, suddenly stood\\nup. Then he strode right toward the monster, dagger in hand, ready to\\nfight it at close quarters.\\n\\nJust as it was about to snap up the poor fisherman, the man-eater saw\\nits new adversary, repositioned itself on its belly, and headed\\nswiftly toward him.\\n\\nI can see Captain Nemo’s bearing to this day. Bracing himself, he\\nwaited for the fearsome man-eater with wonderful composure, and when\\nthe latter rushed at him, the captain leaped aside with prodigious\\nquickness, avoided a collision, and sank his dagger into its\\nbelly. But that wasn’t the end of the story. A dreadful battle was\\njoined.\\n\\nThe shark bellowed, so to speak. Blood was pouring into the waves from\\nits wounds. The sea was dyed red, and through this opaque liquid I\\ncould see nothing else.\\n\\nNothing else until the moment when, through a rift in the clouds, I\\nsaw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal’s fins, fighting\\nthe monster at close quarters, belaboring his enemy’s belly with stabs\\nof the dagger yet unable to deliver the deciding thrust, in other\\nwords, a direct hit to the heart. In its struggles the man-eater\\nchurned the watery mass so furiously, its eddies threatened to knock\\nme over.\\n\\nI wanted to run to the captain’s rescue. But I was transfixed with\\nhorror, unable to move.\\n\\nI stared, wild-eyed. I saw the fight enter a new phase. The captain\\nfell to the seafloor, toppled by the enormous mass weighing him\\ndown. Then the shark’s jaws opened astoundingly wide, like a pair of\\nindustrial shears, and that would have been the finish of Captain Nemo\\nhad not Ned Land, quick as thought, rushed forward with his harpoon\\nand driven its dreadful point into the shark’s underside.\\n\\nThe waves were saturated with masses of blood. The waters shook with\\nthe movements of the man-eater, which thrashed about with\\nindescribable fury. Ned Land hadn’t missed his target. This was the\\nmonster’s death rattle. Pierced to the heart, it was struggling with\\ndreadful spasms whose aftershocks knocked Conseil off his feet.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ned Land pulled the captain clear. Uninjured, the latter\\nstood up, went right to the Indian, quickly cut the rope binding the\\nman to his stone, took the fellow in his arms, and with a vigorous\\nkick of the heel, rose to the surface of the sea.\\n\\nThe three of us followed him, and a few moments later, miraculously\\nsafe, we reached the fisherman’s longboat.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo’s first concern was to revive this unfortunate man. I\\nwasn’t sure he would succeed. I hoped so, since the poor devil hadn’t\\nbeen under very long. But that stroke from the shark’s tail could have\\nbeen his deathblow.\\n\\nFortunately, after vigorous massaging by Conseil and the captain, I\\nsaw the nearly drowned man regain consciousness little by little. He\\nopened his eyes. How startled he must have felt, how frightened even,\\nat seeing four huge, copper craniums leaning over him!\\n\\nAnd above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo pulled a\\nbag of pearls from a pocket in his diving suit and placed it in the\\nfisherman’s hands? This magnificent benefaction from the Man of the\\nWaters to the poor Indian from Ceylon was accepted by the latter with\\ntrembling hands. His bewildered eyes indicated that he didn’t know to\\nwhat superhuman creatures he owed both his life and his fortune.\\n\\nAt the captain’s signal we returned to the bank of shellfish, and\\nretracing our steps, we walked for half an hour until we encountered\\nthe anchor connecting the seafloor with the Nautilus’s skiff.\\n\\nBack on board, the sailors helped divest us of our heavy copper\\ncarapaces.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo’s first words were spoken to the Canadian.\\n\\n“Thank you, Mr. Land,” he told him.\\n\\n“Tit for tat, captain,” Ned Land replied. “I owed it to you.”\\n\\nThe ghost of a smile glided across the captain’s lips, and that was\\nall.\\n\\n“To the Nautilus,” he said.\\n\\nThe longboat flew over the waves. A few minutes later we encountered\\nthe shark’s corpse again, floating.\\n\\nFrom the black markings on the tips of its fins, I recognized the\\ndreadful Squalus melanopterus from the seas of the East Indies, a\\nvariety in the species of sharks proper. It was more than twenty-five\\nfeet long; its enormous mouth occupied a third of its body. It was an\\nadult, as could be seen from the six rows of teeth forming an\\nisosceles triangle in its upper jaw.\\n\\nConseil looked at it with purely scientific fascination, and I’m sure\\nhe placed it, not without good reason, in the class of cartilaginous\\nfish, order Chondropterygia with fixed gills, family Selacia, genus\\nSqualus.\\n\\nWhile I was contemplating this inert mass, suddenly a dozen of these\\nvoracious melanoptera appeared around our longboat; but, paying no\\nattention to us, they pounced on the corpse and quarreled over every\\nscrap of it.\\n\\nBy 8:30 we were back on board the Nautilus.\\n\\nThere I fell to thinking about the incidents that marked our excursion\\nover the Mannar oysterbank. Two impressions inevitably stood out. One\\nconcerned Captain Nemo’s matchless bravery, the other his devotion to\\na human being, a representative of that race from which he had fled\\nbeneath the seas. In spite of everything, this strange man hadn’t yet\\nsucceeded in completely stifling his heart.\\n\\nWhen I shared these impressions with him, he answered me in a tone\\ntouched with emotion:\\n\\n“That Indian, professor, lives in the land of the oppressed, and I am\\nto this day, and will be until my last breath, a native of that same\\nland!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nThe Red Sea\\n\\n\\nDURING THE DAY of January 29, the island of Ceylon disappeared below\\nthe horizon, and at a speed of twenty miles per hour, the Nautilus\\nglided into the labyrinthine channels that separate the Maldive and\\nLaccadive Islands. It likewise hugged Kiltan Island, a shore of\\nmadreporic origin discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499 and one of\\nnineteen chief islands in the island group of the Laccadives, located\\nbetween latitude 10 degrees and 14 degrees 30’ north, and between\\nlongitude 50 degrees 72’ and 69 degrees east.\\n\\nBy then we had fared 16,220 miles, or 7,500 leagues, from our starting\\npoint in the seas of Japan.\\n\\nThe next day, January 30, when the Nautilus rose to the surface of the\\nocean, there was no more land in sight. Setting its course to the\\nnorth-northwest, the ship headed toward the Gulf of Oman, carved out\\nbetween Arabia and the Indian peninsula and providing access to the\\nPersian Gulf.\\n\\nThis was obviously a blind alley with no possible outlet. So where was\\nCaptain Nemo taking us? I was unable to say. Which didn’t satisfy the\\nCanadian, who that day asked me where we were going.\\n\\n“We’re going, Mr. Ned, where the captain’s fancy takes us.”\\n\\n“His fancy,” the Canadian replied, “won’t take us very far. The\\nPersian Gulf has no outlet, and if we enter those waters, it won’t be\\nlong before we return in our tracks.”\\n\\n“All right, we’ll return, Mr. Land, and after the Persian Gulf, if the\\nNautilus wants to visit the Red Sea, the Strait of Bab el Mandeb is\\nstill there to let us in!”\\n\\n“I don’t have to tell you, sir,” Ned Land replied, “that the Red Sea\\nis just as landlocked as the gulf, since the Isthmus of Suez hasn’t\\nbeen cut all the way through yet; and even if it was, a boat as\\nsecretive as ours wouldn’t risk a canal intersected with locks. So the\\nRed Sea won’t be our way back to Europe either.”\\n\\n“But I didn’t say we’d return to Europe.”\\n\\n“What do you figure, then?”\\n\\n“I figure that after visiting these unusual waterways of Arabia and\\nEgypt, the Nautilus will go back down to the Indian Ocean, perhaps\\nthrough Mozambique Channel, perhaps off the Mascarene Islands, and\\nthen make for the Cape of Good Hope.”\\n\\n“And once we’re at the Cape of Good Hope?” the Canadian asked with\\ntypical persistence.\\n\\n“Well then, we’ll enter that Atlantic Ocean with which we aren’t yet\\nfamiliar. What’s wrong, Ned my friend? Are you tired of this voyage\\nunder the seas? Are you bored with the constantly changing sight of\\nthese underwater wonders? Speaking for myself, I’ll be extremely\\ndistressed to see the end of a voyage so few men will ever have a\\nchance to make.”\\n\\n“But don’t you realize, Professor Aronnax,” the Canadian replied,\\n“that soon we’ll have been imprisoned for three whole months aboard\\nthis Nautilus?”\\n\\n“No, Ned, I didn’t realize it, I don’t want to realize it, and I don’t\\nkeep track of every day and every hour.”\\n\\n“But when will it be over?”\\n\\n“In its appointed time. Meanwhile there’s nothing we can do about it,\\nand our discussions are futile. My gallant Ned, if you come and tell\\nme, ‘A chance to escape is available to us,’ then I’ll discuss it with\\nyou. But that isn’t the case, and in all honesty, I don’t think\\nCaptain Nemo ever ventures into European seas.”\\n\\nThis short dialogue reveals that in my mania for the Nautilus, I was\\nturning into the spitting image of its commander.\\n\\nAs for Ned Land, he ended our talk in his best speechifying style:\\n“That’s all fine and dandy. But in my humble opinion, a life in jail\\nis a life without joy.”\\n\\nFor four days until February 3, the Nautilus inspected the Gulf of\\nOman at various speeds and depths. It seemed to be traveling at\\nrandom, as if hesitating over which course to follow, but it never\\ncrossed the Tropic of Cancer.\\n\\nAfter leaving this gulf we raised Muscat for an instant, the most\\nimportant town in the country of Oman. I marveled at its strange\\nappearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it, against\\nwhich the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply. I spotted\\nthe rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant tips of its minarets,\\nand its fresh, leafy terraces. But it was only a fleeting vision, and\\nthe Nautilus soon sank beneath the dark waves of these waterways.\\n\\nThen our ship went along at a distance of six miles from the Arabic\\ncoasts of Mahra and Hadhramaut, their undulating lines of mountains\\nrelieved by a few ancient ruins. On February 5 we finally put into the\\nGulf of Aden, a genuine funnel stuck into the neck of Bab el Mandeb\\nand bottling these Indian waters in the Red Sea.\\n\\nOn February 6 the Nautilus cruised in sight of the city of Aden,\\nperched on a promontory connected to the continent by a narrow\\nisthmus, a sort of inaccessible Gibraltar whose fortifications the\\nEnglish rebuilt after capturing it in 1839. I glimpsed the octagonal\\nminarets of this town, which used to be one of the wealthiest, busiest\\ncommercial centers along this coast, as the Arab historian Idrisi\\ntells it.\\n\\nI was convinced that when Captain Nemo reached this point, he would\\nback out again; but I was mistaken, and much to my surprise, he did\\nnothing of the sort.\\n\\nThe next day, February 7, we entered the Strait of Bab el Mandeb,\\nwhose name means “Gate of Tears” in the Arabic language. Twenty miles\\nwide, it’s only fifty-two kilometers long, and with the Nautilus\\nlaunched at full speed, clearing it was the work of barely an\\nhour. But I didn’t see a thing, not even Perim Island where the\\nBritish government built fortifications to strengthen Aden’s\\nposition. There were many English and French steamers plowing this\\nnarrow passageway, liners going from Suez to Bombay, Calcutta,\\nMelbourne, RΘunion Island, and Mauritius; far too much traffic for the\\nNautilus to make an appearance on the surface. So it wisely stayed in\\nmidwater.\\n\\nFinally, at noon, we were plowing the waves of the Red Sea.\\n\\nThe Red Sea: that great lake so famous in biblical traditions, seldom\\nreplenished by rains, fed by no important rivers, continually drained\\nby a high rate of evaporation, its water level dropping a meter and a\\nhalf every year! If it were fully landlocked like a lake, this odd\\ngulf might dry up completely; on this score it’s inferior to its\\nneighbors, the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea, whose levels lower only\\nto the point where their evaporation exactly equals the amounts of\\nwater they take to their hearts.\\n\\nThis Red Sea is 2,600 kilometers long with an average width of 240. In\\nthe days of the\\n\\nPtolemies and the Roman emperors, it was a great commercial artery for\\nthe world, and when its isthmus has been cut through, it will\\ncompletely regain that bygone importance that the Suez railways have\\nalready brought back in part.\\n\\nI would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced Captain\\nNemo to take us into this gulf. But I wholeheartedly approved of the\\nNautilus’s entering it. It adopted a medium pace, sometimes staying on\\nthe surface, sometimes diving to avoid some ship, and so I could\\nobserve both the inside and topside of this highly unusual sea.\\n\\nOn February 8, as early as the first hours of daylight, Mocha appeared\\nbefore us: a town now in ruins, whose walls would collapse at the mere\\nsound of a cannon, and which shelters a few leafy date trees here and\\nthere. This once-important city used to contain six public\\nmarketplaces plus twenty-six mosques, and its walls, protected by\\nfourteen forts, fashioned a three-kilometer girdle around it.\\n\\nThen the Nautilus drew near the beaches of Africa, where the sea is\\nconsiderably deeper. There, through the open panels and in a midwater\\nof crystal clarity, our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of\\nshining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs\\nof algae and fucus. What an indescribable sight, and what a variety of\\nsettings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled\\noff by the Libyan coast! But soon the Nautilus hugged the eastern\\nshore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory. This was off\\nthe coast of Tihama, and there such zoophyte displays not only\\nflourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque\\nnetworks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it; the latter\\nwere more whimsical but less colorful than the former, which kept\\ntheir bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters.\\n\\nHow many delightful hours I spent in this way at the lounge window!\\nHow many new specimens of underwater flora and fauna I marveled at\\nbeneath the light of our electric beacon! Mushroom-shaped fungus\\ncoral, some slate-colored sea anemone including the species\\nThalassianthus aster among others, organ-pipe coral arranged like\\nflutes and just begging for a puff from the god Pan, shells unique to\\nthis sea that dwell in madreporic cavities and whose bases are twisted\\ninto squat spirals, and finally a thousand samples of a polypary I\\nhadn’t observed until then: the common sponge.\\n\\nFirst division in the polyp group, the class Spongiaria has been\\ncreated by scientists precisely for this unusual exhibit whose\\nusefulness is beyond dispute. The sponge is definitely not a plant, as\\nsome naturalists still believe, but an animal of the lowest order, a\\npolypary inferior even to coral. Its animal nature isn’t in doubt, and\\nwe can’t accept even the views of the ancients, who regarded it as\\nhalfway between plant and animal. But I must say that naturalists are\\nnot in agreement on the structural mode of sponges. For some it’s a\\npolypary, and for others, such as Professor Milne-Edwards, it’s a\\nsingle, solitary individual.\\n\\nThe class Spongiaria contains about 300 species that are encountered\\nin a large number of seas and even in certain streams, where they’ve\\nbeen given the name freshwater sponges. But their waters of choice are\\nthe Red Sea and the Mediterranean near the Greek Islands or the coast\\nof Syria. These waters witness the reproduction and growth of soft,\\ndelicate bath sponges whose prices run as high as 150 francs apiece:\\nthe yellow sponge from Syria, the horn sponge from Barbary, etc. But\\nsince I had no hope of studying these zoophytes in the seaports of the\\nLevant, from which we were separated by the insuperable Isthmus of\\nSuez, I had to be content with observing them in the waters of the Red\\nSea.\\n\\nSo I called Conseil to my side, while at an average depth of eight to\\nnine meters, the Nautilus slowly skimmed every beautiful rock on the\\neasterly coast.\\n\\nThere sponges grew in every shape, globular, stalklike, leaflike,\\nfingerlike. With reasonable accuracy, they lived up to their nicknames\\nof basket sponges, chalice sponges, distaff sponges, elkhorn sponges,\\nlion’s paws, peacock’s tails, and Neptune’s gloves—designations\\nbestowed on them by fishermen, more poetically inclined than\\nscientists. A gelatinous, semifluid substance coated the fibrous\\ntissue of these sponges, and from this tissue there escaped a steady\\ntrickle of water that, after carrying sustenance to each cell, was\\nbeing expelled by a contracting movement. This jellylike substance\\ndisappears when the polyp dies, emitting ammonia as it rots. Finally\\nnothing remains but the fibers, either gelatinous or made of horn,\\nthat constitute your household sponge, which takes on a russet hue and\\nis used for various tasks depending on its degree of elasticity,\\npermeability, or resistance to saturation.\\n\\nThese polyparies were sticking to rocks, shells of mollusks, and even\\nthe stalks of water plants. They adorned the smallest crevices, some\\nsprawling, others standing or hanging like coral outgrowths. I told\\nConseil that sponges are fished up in two ways, either by dragnet or\\nby hand. The latter method calls for the services of a diver, but it’s\\npreferable because it spares the polypary’s tissue, leaving it with a\\nmuch higher market value.\\n\\nOther zoophytes swarming near the sponges consisted chiefly of a very\\nelegant species of jellyfish; mollusks were represented by varieties\\nof squid that, according to Professor Orbigny, are unique to the Red\\nSea; and reptiles by virgata turtles belonging to the genus Chelonia,\\nwhich furnished our table with a dainty but wholesome dish.\\n\\nAs for fish, they were numerous and often remarkable. Here are the\\nones that the Nautilus’s nets most frequently hauled on board: rays,\\nincluding spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick red in color,\\ntheir bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and identifiable by\\ntheir jagged double stings, silver-backed skates, common stingrays\\nwith stippled tails, butterfly rays that looked like huge two-meter\\ncloaks flapping at middepth, toothless guitarfish that were a type of\\ncartilaginous fish closer to the shark, trunkfish known as dromedaries\\nthat were one and a half feet long and had humps ending in\\nbackward-curving stings, serpentine moray eels with silver tails and\\nbluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed in gray piping, a species of\\nbutterfish called the fiatola decked out in thin gold stripes and the\\nthree colors of the French flag, Montague blennies four decimeters\\nlong, superb jacks handsomely embellished by seven black crosswise\\nstreaks with blue and yellow fins plus gold and silver scales, snooks,\\nstandard mullet with yellow heads, parrotfish, wrasse, triggerfish,\\ngobies, etc., plus a thousand other fish common to the oceans we had\\nalready crossed.\\n\\nOn February 9 the Nautilus cruised in the widest part of the Red Sea,\\nmeasuring 190 miles straight across from Suakin on the west coast to\\nQunfidha on the east coast.\\n\\nAt noon that day after our position fix, Captain Nemo climbed onto the\\nplatform, where I happened to be. I vowed not to let him go below\\nagain without at least sounding him out on his future plans. As soon\\nas he saw me, he came over, graciously offered me a cigar, and said to\\nme:\\n\\n“Well, professor, are you pleased with this Red Sea? Have you seen\\nenough of its hidden wonders, its fish and zoophytes, its gardens of\\nsponges and forests of coral? Have you glimpsed the towns built on its\\nshores?”\\n\\n“Yes, Captain Nemo,” I replied, “and the Nautilus is wonderfully\\nsuited to this whole survey. Ah, it’s a clever boat!”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, clever, daring, and invulnerable! It fears neither the Red\\nSea’s dreadful storms nor its currents and reefs.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” I said, “this sea is mentioned as one of the worst, and in\\nthe days of the ancients, if I’m not mistaken, it had an abominable\\nreputation.”\\n\\n“Thoroughly abominable, Professor Aronnax. The Greek and Latin\\nhistorians can find nothing to say in its favor, and the Greek\\ngeographer Strabo adds that it’s especially rough during the rainy\\nseason and the period of summer prevailing winds. The Arab Idrisi,\\nreferring to it by the name Gulf of Colzoum, relates that ships\\nperished in large numbers on its sandbanks and that no one risked\\nnavigating it by night. This, he claims, is a sea subject to fearful\\nhurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands, and ‘with nothing good\\nto offer,’ either on its surface or in its depths. As a matter of\\nfact, the same views can also be found in Arrian, Agatharchides, and\\nArtemidorus.”\\n\\n“One can easily see,” I answered, “that those historians didn’t\\nnavigate aboard the Nautilus.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” the captain replied with a smile, “and in this respect, the\\nmoderns aren’t much farther along than the ancients. It took many\\ncenturies to discover the mechanical power of steam! Who knows whether\\nwe’ll see a second Nautilus within the next 100 years! Progress is\\nslow, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“It’s true,” I replied. “Your ship is a century ahead of its time,\\nperhaps several centuries. It would be most unfortunate if such a\\nsecret were to die with its inventor!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo did not reply. After some minutes of silence:\\n\\n“We were discussing,” he said, “the views of ancient historians on the\\ndangers of navigating this Red Sea?”\\n\\n“True,” I replied. “But weren’t their fears exaggerated?”\\n\\n“Yes and no, Professor Aronnax,” answered Captain Nemo, who seemed to\\nknow “his Red Sea” by heart. “To a modern ship, well rigged, solidly\\nconstructed, and in control of its course thanks to obedient steam,\\nsome conditions are no longer hazardous that offered all sorts of\\ndangers to the vessels of the ancients. Picture those early navigators\\nventuring forth in sailboats built from planks lashed together with\\npalm-tree ropes, caulked with powdered resin, and coated with dogfish\\ngrease. They didn’t even have instruments for taking their bearings,\\nthey went by guesswork in the midst of currents they barely\\nknew. Under such conditions, shipwrecks had to be numerous. But\\nnowadays steamers providing service between Suez and the South Seas\\nhave nothing to fear from the fury of this gulf, despite the contrary\\nwinds of its monsoons. Their captains and passengers no longer prepare\\nfor departure with sacrifices to placate the gods, and after\\nreturning, they don’t traipse in wreaths and gold ribbons to say\\nthanks at the local temple.”\\n\\n“Agreed,” I said. “And steam seems to have killed off all gratitude in\\nseamen’s hearts. But since you seem to have made a special study of\\nthis sea, captain, can you tell me how it got its name?”\\n\\n“Many explanations exist on the subject, Professor Aronnax. Would you\\nlike to hear the views of one chronicler in the 14th century?”\\n\\n“Gladly.”\\n\\n“This fanciful fellow claims the sea was given its name after the\\ncrossing of the Israelites, when the Pharaoh perished in those waves\\nthat came together again at Moses’ command:\\n\\nTo mark that miraculous sequel, the sea turned a red without equal.\\n\\nThus no other course would do but to name it for its hue.”\\n\\n“An artistic explanation, Captain Nemo,” I replied, “but I’m unable to\\nrest content with it. So I’ll ask you for your own personal views.”\\n\\n“Here they come. To my thinking, Professor Aronnax, this ‘Red Sea’\\ndesignation must be regarded as a translation of the Hebrew word\\n‘Edrom,’ and if the ancients gave it that name, it was because of the\\nunique color of its waters.”\\n\\n“Until now, however, I’ve seen only clear waves, without any unique\\nhue.”\\n\\n“Surely, but as we move ahead to the far end of this gulf, you’ll note\\nits odd appearance. I recall seeing the bay of El Tur completely red,\\nlike a lake of blood.”\\n\\n“And you attribute this color to the presence of microscopic algae?”\\n\\n“Yes. It’s a purplish, mucilaginous substance produced by those tiny\\nbuds known by the name trichodesmia, 40,000 of which are needed to\\noccupy the space of one square millimeter. Perhaps you’ll encounter\\nthem when we reach El Tur.”\\n\\n“Hence, Captain Nemo, this isn’t the first time you’ve gone through\\nthe Red Sea aboard the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Then, since you’ve already mentioned the crossing of the Israelites\\nand the catastrophe that befell the Egyptians, I would ask if you’ve\\never discovered any traces under the waters of that great historic\\nevent?”\\n\\n“No, professor, and for an excellent reason.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“It’s because that same locality where Moses crossed with all his\\npeople is now so clogged with sand, camels can barely get their legs\\nwet. You can understand that my Nautilus wouldn’t have enough water\\nfor itself.”\\n\\n“And that locality is . . . ?” I asked.\\n\\n“That locality lies a little above Suez in a sound that used to form a\\ndeep estuary when the Red Sea stretched as far as the Bitter\\nLakes. Now, whether or not their crossing was literally miraculous,\\nthe Israelites did cross there in returning to the Promised Land, and\\nthe Pharaoh’s army did perish at precisely that locality. So I think\\nthat excavating those sands would bring to light a great many weapons\\nand tools of Egyptian origin.”\\n\\n“Obviously,” I replied. “And for the sake of archaeology, let’s hope\\nthat sooner or later such excavations do take place, once new towns\\nare settled on the isthmus after the Suez Canal has been cut through—a\\ncanal, by the way, of little use to a ship such as the Nautilus!”\\n\\n“Surely, but of great use to the world at large,” Captain Nemo\\nsaid. “The ancients well understood the usefulness to commerce of\\nconnecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, but they never dreamed\\nof cutting a canal between the two, and instead they picked the Nile\\nas their link. If we can trust tradition, it was probably Egypt’s King\\nSesostris who started digging the canal needed to join the Nile with\\nthe Red Sea. What’s certain is that in 615 B.C. King Necho II was hard\\nat work on a canal that was fed by Nile water and ran through the\\nEgyptian plains opposite Arabia. This canal could be traveled in four\\ndays, and it was so wide, two triple-tiered galleys could pass through\\nit abreast. Its construction was continued by Darius the Great, son of\\nHystaspes, and probably completed by King Ptolemy II. Strabo saw it\\nused for shipping; but the weakness of its slope between its starting\\npoint, near Bubastis, and the Red Sea left it navigable only a few\\nmonths out of the year. This canal served commerce until the century\\nof Rome’s Antonine emperors; it was then abandoned and covered with\\nsand, subsequently reinstated by Arabia’s Caliph Omar I, and finally\\nfilled in for good in 761 or 762 A.D. by Caliph Al-Mansur, in an\\neffort to prevent supplies from reaching Mohammed ibn Abdullah, who\\nhad rebelled against him. During his Egyptian campaign, your General\\nNapoleon Bonaparte discovered traces of this old canal in the Suez\\ndesert, and when the tide caught him by surprise, he wellnigh perished\\njust a few hours before rejoining his regiment at Hadjaroth, the very\\nplace where Moses had pitched camp 3,300 years before him.”\\n\\n“Well, captain, what the ancients hesitated to undertake, Mr. de\\nLesseps is now finishing up; his joining of these two seas will\\nshorten the route from Cadiz to the East Indies by 9,000 kilometers,\\nand he’ll soon change Africa into an immense island.”\\n\\n“Yes, Professor Aronnax, and you have every right to be proud of your\\nfellow countryman. Such a man brings a nation more honor than the\\ngreatest commanders! Like so many others, he began with difficulties\\nand setbacks, but he triumphed because he has the volunteer\\nspirit. And it’s sad to think that this deed, which should have been\\nan international deed, which would have insured that any\\nadministration went down in history, will succeed only through the\\nefforts of one man. So all hail to Mr. de Lesseps!”\\n\\n“Yes, all hail to that great French citizen,” I replied, quite\\nstartled by how emphatically Captain Nemo had just spoken.\\n\\n“Unfortunately,” he went on, “I can’t take you through that Suez\\nCanal, but the day after tomorrow, you’ll be able to see the long\\njetties of Port Said when we’re in the Mediterranean.”\\n\\n“In the Mediterranean!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, professor. Does that amaze you?”\\n\\n“What amazes me is thinking we’ll be there the day after tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Oh really?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain, although since I’ve been aboard your vessel, I should\\nhave formed the habit of not being amazed by anything!”\\n\\n“But what is it that startles you?”\\n\\n“The thought of how hideously fast the Nautilus will need to go, if\\nit’s to double the Cape of Good Hope, circle around Africa, and lie in\\nthe open Mediterranean by the day after tomorrow.”\\n\\n“And who says it will circle Africa, professor? What’s this talk about\\ndoubling the Cape of Good Hope?”\\n\\n“But unless the Nautilus navigates on dry land and crosses over the\\nisthmus—”\\n\\n“Or under it, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“Under it?”\\n\\n“Surely,” Captain Nemo replied serenely. “Under that tongue of land,\\nnature long ago made what man today is making on its surface.”\\n\\n“What! There’s a passageway?”\\n\\n“Yes, an underground passageway that I’ve named the Arabian Tunnel. It\\nstarts below Suez and leads to the Bay of Pelusium.”\\n\\n“But isn’t that isthmus only composed of quicksand?”\\n\\n“To a certain depth. But at merely fifty meters, one encounters a firm\\nfoundation of rock.”\\n\\n“And it’s by luck that you discovered this passageway?” I asked, more\\nand more startled.\\n\\n“Luck plus logic, professor, and logic even more than luck.”\\n\\n“Captain, I hear you, but I can’t believe my ears.”\\n\\n“Oh, sir! The old saying still holds good: Aures habent et non\\naudient!* Not only does this passageway exist, but I’ve taken\\nadvantage of it on several occasions. Without it, I wouldn’t have\\nventured today into such a blind alley as the Red Sea.”\\n\\n*Latin: “They have ears but hear not.” Ed.\\n\\n“Is it indiscreet to ask how you discovered this tunnel?”\\n\\n“Sir,” the captain answered me, “there can be no secrets between men\\nwho will never leave each other.”\\n\\nI ignored this innuendo and waited for Captain Nemo’s explanation.\\n\\n“Professor,” he told me, “the simple logic of the naturalist led me to\\ndiscover this passageway, and I alone am familiar with it. I’d noted\\nthat in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean there exist a number of\\nabsolutely identical species of fish: eels, butterfish, greenfish,\\nbass, jewelfish, flying fish. Certain of this fact, I wondered if\\nthere weren’t a connection between the two seas. If there were, its\\nunderground current had to go from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean\\nsimply because of their difference in level. So I caught a large\\nnumber of fish in the vicinity of Suez. I slipped copper rings around\\ntheir tails and tossed them back into the sea. A few months later off\\nthe coast of Syria, I recaptured a few specimens of my fish, adorned\\nwith their telltale rings. So this proved to me that some connection\\nexisted between the two seas. I searched for it with my Nautilus, I\\ndiscovered it, I ventured into it; and soon, professor, you also will\\nhave cleared my Arabic tunnel!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nArabian Tunnel\\n\\n\\nTHE SAME DAY, I reported to Conseil and Ned Land that part of the\\nforegoing conversation directly concerning them. When I told them we\\nwould be lying in Mediterranean waters within two days, Conseil\\nclapped his hands, but the Canadian shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“An underwater tunnel!” he exclaimed. “A connection between two seas!\\nWho ever heard of such malarkey!”\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” Conseil replied, “had you ever heard of the Nautilus?\\nNo, yet here it is! So don’t shrug your shoulders so blithely, and\\ndon’t discount something with the feeble excuse that you’ve never\\nheard of it.”\\n\\n“We’ll soon see!” Ned Land shot back, shaking his head. “After all,\\nI’d like nothing better than to believe in your captain’s little\\npassageway, and may Heaven grant it really does take us to the\\nMediterranean.”\\n\\nThe same evening, at latitude 21 degrees 30’ north, the Nautilus was\\nafloat on the surface of the sea and drawing nearer to the Arab\\ncoast. I spotted Jidda, an important financial center for Egypt,\\nSyria, Turkey, and the East Indies. I could distinguish with\\nreasonable clarity the overall effect of its buildings, the ships made\\nfast along its wharves, and those bigger vessels whose draft of water\\nrequired them to drop anchor at the port’s offshore mooring. The sun,\\nfairly low on the horizon, struck full force on the houses in this\\ntown, accenting their whiteness. Outside the city limits, some wood or\\nreed huts indicated the quarter where the bedouins lived.\\n\\nSoon Jidda faded into the shadows of evening, and the Nautilus went\\nback beneath the mildly phosphorescent waters.\\n\\nThe next day, February 10, several ships appeared, running on our\\nopposite tack. The Nautilus resumed its underwater navigating; but at\\nthe moment of our noon sights, the sea was deserted and the ship rose\\nagain to its waterline.\\n\\nWith Ned and Conseil, I went to sit on the platform. The coast to the\\neast looked like a slightly blurred mass in a damp fog.\\n\\nLeaning against the sides of the skiff, we were chatting of one thing\\nand another, when Ned Land stretched his hand toward a point in the\\nwater, saying to me:\\n\\n“See anything out there, professor?”\\n\\n“No, Ned,” I replied, “but you know I don’t have your eyes.”\\n\\n“Take a good look,” Ned went on. “There, ahead to starboard, almost\\nlevel with the beacon! Don’t you see a mass that seems to be moving\\naround?”\\n\\n“Right,” I said after observing carefully, “I can make out something\\nlike a long, blackish object on the surface of the water.”\\n\\n“A second Nautilus?” Conseil said.\\n\\n“No,” the Canadian replied, “unless I’m badly mistaken, that’s some\\nmarine animal.”\\n\\n“Are there whales in the Red Sea?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” I replied, “they’re sometimes found here.”\\n\\n“That’s no whale,” continued Ned Land, whose eyes never strayed from\\nthe object they had sighted. “We’re old chums, whales and I, and I\\ncouldn’t mistake their little ways.”\\n\\n“Let’s wait and see,” Conseil said. “The Nautilus is heading that\\ndirection, and we’ll soon know what we’re in for.”\\n\\nIn fact, that blackish object was soon only a mile away from us. It\\nlooked like a huge reef stranded in midocean. What was it? I still\\ncouldn’t make up my mind.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s moving off! It’s diving!” Ned Land exclaimed. “Damnation!\\nWhat can that animal be? It doesn’t have a forked tail like baleen\\nwhales or sperm whales, and its fins look like sawed-off limbs.”\\n\\n“But in that case—” I put in.\\n\\n“Good lord,” the Canadian went on, “it’s rolled over on its back, and\\nit’s raising its breasts in the air!”\\n\\n“It’s a siren!” Conseil exclaimed. “With all due respect to master,\\nit’s an actual mermaid!”\\n\\nThat word “siren” put me back on track, and I realized that the animal\\nbelonged to the order Sirenia: marine creatures that legends have\\nturned into mermaids, half woman, half fish.\\n\\n“No,” I told Conseil, “that’s no mermaid, it’s an unusual creature of\\nwhich only a few specimens are left in the Red Sea. That’s a dugong.”\\n\\n“Order Sirenia, group Pisciforma, subclass Monodelphia, class\\nMammalia, branch Vertebrata,” Conseil replied.\\n\\nAnd when Conseil has spoken, there’s nothing else to be said.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ned Land kept staring. His eyes were gleaming with desire at\\nthe sight of that animal. His hands were ready to hurl a harpoon. You\\nwould have thought he was waiting for the right moment to jump\\noverboard and attack the creature in its own element.\\n\\n“Oh, sir,” he told me in a voice trembling with excitement, “I’ve\\nnever killed anything like that!”\\n\\nHis whole being was concentrated in this last word.\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo appeared on the platform. He spotted the\\ndugong. He understood the Canadian’s frame of mind and addressed him\\ndirectly:\\n\\n“If you held a harpoon, Mr. Land, wouldn’t your hands be itching to\\nput it to work?”\\n\\n“Positively, sir.”\\n\\n“And just for one day, would it displease you to return to your\\nfisherman’s trade and add this cetacean to the list of those you’ve\\nalready hunted down?”\\n\\n“It wouldn’t displease me one bit.”\\n\\n“All right, you can try your luck!”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir,” Ned Land replied, his eyes ablaze.\\n\\n“Only,” the captain went on, “I urge you to aim carefully at this\\nanimal, in your own personal interest.”\\n\\n“Is the dugong dangerous to attack?” I asked, despite the Canadian’s\\nshrug of the shoulders.\\n\\n“Yes, sometimes,” the captain replied. “These animals have been known\\nto turn on their assailants and capsize their longboats. But with\\nMr. Land that danger isn’t to be feared. His eye is sharp, his arm is\\nsure. If I recommend that he aim carefully at this dugong, it’s\\nbecause the animal is justly regarded as fine game, and I know\\nMr. Land doesn’t despise a choice morsel.”\\n\\n“Aha!” the Canadian put in. “This beast offers the added luxury of\\nbeing good to eat?”\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Land. Its flesh is actual red meat, highly prized, and set\\naside throughout Malaysia for the tables of aristocrats. Accordingly,\\nthis excellent animal has been hunted so bloodthirstily that, like its\\nmanatee relatives, it has become more and more scarce.”\\n\\n“In that case, captain,” Conseil said in all seriousness, “on the\\noffchance that this creature might be the last of its line, wouldn’t\\nit be advisable to spare its life, in the interests of science?”\\n\\n“Maybe,” the Canadian answered, “it would be better to hunt it down,\\nin the interests of mealtime.”\\n\\n“Then proceed, Mr. Land,” Captain Nemo replied.\\n\\nJust then, as mute and emotionless as ever, seven crewmen climbed onto\\nthe platform. One carried a harpoon and line similar to those used in\\nwhale fishing. Its deck paneling opened, the skiff was wrenched from\\nits socket and launched to sea. Six rowers sat on the thwarts, and the\\ncoxswain took the tiller. Ned, Conseil, and I found seats in the\\nstern.\\n\\n“Aren’t you coming, captain?” I asked.\\n\\n“No, sir, but I wish you happy hunting.”\\n\\nThe skiff pulled clear, and carried off by its six oars, it headed\\nswiftly toward the dugong, which by then was floating two miles from\\nthe Nautilus.\\n\\nArriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean, our longboat\\nslowed down, and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil\\nwaters. Harpoon in hand, Ned Land went to take his stand in the\\nskiff’s bow. Harpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to\\na very long rope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags\\nit with him. But this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms,\\nand its end had simply been fastened to a small barrel that, while\\nfloating, would indicate the dugong’s movements beneath the waters.\\n\\nI stood up and could clearly observe the Canadian’s adversary. This\\ndugong—which also boasts the name halicore—closely resembled a\\nmanatee. Its oblong body ended in a very long caudal fin and its\\nlateral fins in actual fingers. It differs from the manatee in that\\nits upper jaw is armed with two long, pointed teeth that form\\ndiverging tusks on either side.\\n\\nThis dugong that Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal\\ndimensions, easily exceeding seven meters in length. It didn’t stir\\nand seemed to be sleeping on the surface of the waves, a circumstance\\nthat should have made it easier to capture.\\n\\nThe skiff approached cautiously to within three fathoms of the\\nanimal. The oars hung suspended above their rowlocks. I was\\ncrouching. His body leaning slightly back, Ned Land brandished his\\nharpoon with expert hands.\\n\\nSuddenly a hissing sound was audible, and the dugong\\ndisappeared. Although the harpoon had been forcefully hurled, it\\napparently had hit only water.\\n\\n“Damnation!” exclaimed the furious Canadian. “I missed it!”\\n\\n“No,” I said, “the animal’s wounded, there’s its blood; but your\\nweapon didn’t stick in its body.”\\n\\n“My harpoon! Get my harpoon!” Ned Land exclaimed.\\n\\nThe sailors went back to their sculling, and the coxswain steered the\\nlongboat toward the floating barrel. We fished up the harpoon, and the\\nskiff started off in pursuit of the animal.\\n\\nThe latter returned from time to time to breathe at the surface of the\\nsea. Its wound hadn’t weakened it because it went with tremendous\\nspeed. Driven by energetic arms, the longboat flew on its\\ntrail. Several times we got within a few fathoms of it, and the\\nCanadian hovered in readiness to strike; but then the dugong would\\nsteal away with a sudden dive, and it proved impossible to overtake\\nthe beast.\\n\\nI’ll let you assess the degree of anger consuming our impatient Ned\\nLand. He hurled at the hapless animal the most potent swearwords in\\nthe English language. For my part, I was simply distressed to see this\\ndugong outwit our every scheme.\\n\\nWe chased it unflaggingly for a full hour, and I’d begun to think it\\nwould prove too difficult to capture, when the animal got the untimely\\nidea of taking revenge on us, a notion it would soon have cause to\\nregret. It wheeled on the skiff, to assault us in its turn.\\n\\nThis maneuver did not escape the Canadian.\\n\\n“Watch out!” he said.\\n\\nThe coxswain pronounced a few words in his bizarre language, and no\\ndoubt he alerted his men to keep on their guard.\\n\\nArriving within twenty feet of the skiff, the dugong stopped, sharply\\nsniffing the air with its huge nostrils, pierced not at the tip of its\\nmuzzle but on its topside. Then it gathered itself and sprang at us.\\n\\nThe skiff couldn’t avoid the collision. Half overturned, it shipped a\\nton or two of water that we had to bail out. But thanks to our\\nskillful coxswain, we were fouled on the bias rather than broadside,\\nso we didn’t capsize. Clinging to the stempost, Ned Land thrust his\\nharpoon again and again into the gigantic animal, which imbedded its\\nteeth in our gunwale and lifted the longboat out of the water as a\\nlion would lift a deer. We were thrown on top of each other, and I\\nhave no idea how the venture would have ended had not the Canadian,\\nstill thirsting for the beast’s blood, finally pierced it to the\\nheart.\\n\\nI heard its teeth grind on sheet iron, and the dugong disappeared,\\ntaking our harpoon along with it. But the barrel soon popped up on the\\nsurface, and a few moments later the animal’s body appeared and rolled\\nover on its back. Our skiff rejoined it, took it in tow, and headed to\\nthe Nautilus.\\n\\nIt took pulleys of great strength to hoist this dugong onto the\\nplatform. The beast weighed 5,000 kilograms. It was carved up in sight\\nof the Canadian, who remained to watch every detail of the\\noperation. At dinner the same day, my steward served me some slices of\\nthis flesh, skillfully dressed by the ship’s cook. I found it\\nexcellent, even better than veal if not beef.\\n\\nThe next morning, February 11, the Nautilus’s pantry was enriched by\\nmore dainty game. A covey of terns alighted on the Nautilus. They were\\na species of Sterna nilotica unique to Egypt: beak black, head gray\\nand stippled, eyes surrounded by white dots, back, wings, and tail\\ngrayish, belly and throat white, feet red. Also caught were a couple\\ndozen Nile duck, superior-tasting wildfowl whose neck and crown of the\\nhead are white speckled with black.\\n\\nBy then the Nautilus had reduced speed. It moved ahead at a saunter,\\nso to speak. I observed that the Red Sea’s water was becoming less\\nsalty the closer we got to Suez.\\n\\nNear five o’clock in the afternoon, we sighted Cape Ras Mohammed to\\nthe north. This cape forms the tip of Arabia Petraea, which lies\\nbetween the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba.\\n\\nThe Nautilus entered the Strait of Jubal, which leads to the Gulf of\\nSuez. I could clearly make out a high mountain crowning Ras Mohammed\\nbetween the two gulfs. It was Mt. Horeb, that biblical Mt. Sinai on\\nwhose summit Moses met God face to face, that summit the mind’s eye\\nalways pictures as wreathed in lightning.\\n\\nAt six o’clock, sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged, the Nautilus\\npassed well out from El Tur, which sat at the far end of a bay whose\\nwaters seemed to be dyed red, as Captain Nemo had already\\nmentioned. Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence\\noccasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds, by\\nthe sound of surf chafing against rocks, or by the distant moan of a\\nsteamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades.\\n\\nFrom eight to nine o’clock, the Nautilus stayed a few meters beneath\\nthe waters. According to my calculations, we had to be quite close to\\nSuez. Through the panels in the lounge, I spotted rocky bottoms\\nbrightly lit by our electric rays. It seemed to me that the strait was\\ngetting narrower and narrower.\\n\\nAt 9:15 when our boat returned to the surface, I climbed onto the\\nplatform. I was quite impatient to clear Captain Nemo’s tunnel,\\ncouldn’t sit still, and wanted to breathe the fresh night air.\\n\\nSoon, in the shadows, I spotted a pale signal light glimmering a mile\\naway, half discolored by mist.\\n\\n“A floating lighthouse,” said someone next to me.\\n\\nI turned and discovered the captain.\\n\\n“That’s the floating signal light of Suez,” he went on. “It won’t be\\nlong before we reach the entrance to the tunnel.”\\n\\n“It can’t be very easy to enter it.”\\n\\n“No, sir. Accordingly, I’m in the habit of staying in the pilothouse\\nand directing maneuvers myself. And now if you’ll kindly go below,\\nProfessor Aronnax, the Nautilus is about to sink beneath the waves,\\nand it will only return to the surface after we’ve cleared the Arabian\\nTunnel.”\\n\\nI followed Captain Nemo. The hatch closed, the ballast tanks filled\\nwith water, and the submersible sank some ten meters down.\\n\\nJust as I was about to repair to my stateroom, the captain stopped me.\\n\\n“Professor,” he said to me, “would you like to go with me to the\\nwheelhouse?”\\n\\n“I was afraid to ask,” I replied.\\n\\n“Come along, then. This way, you’ll learn the full story about this\\ncombination underwater and underground navigating.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo led me to the central companionway. In midstair he opened\\na door, went along the upper gangways, and arrived at the wheelhouse,\\nwhich, as you know, stands at one end of the platform.\\n\\nIt was a cabin measuring six feet square and closely resembling those\\noccupied by the helmsmen of steamboats on the Mississippi or Hudson\\nrivers. In the center stood an upright wheel geared to rudder cables\\nrunning to the Nautilus’s stern. Set in the cabin’s walls were four\\ndeadlights, windows of biconvex glass that enabled the man at the helm\\nto see in every direction.\\n\\nThe cabin was dark; but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness\\nand I saw the pilot, a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs of\\nthe wheel. Outside, the sea was brightly lit by the beacon shining\\nbehind the cabin at the other end of the platform.\\n\\n“Now,” Captain Nemo said, “let’s look for our passageway.”\\n\\nElectric wires linked the pilothouse with the engine room, and from\\nthis cabin the captain could simultaneously signal heading and speed\\nto his Nautilus. He pressed a metal button and at once the propeller\\nslowed down significantly.\\n\\nI stared in silence at the high, sheer wall we were skirting just\\nthen, the firm base of the sandy mountains on the coast. For an hour\\nwe went along it in this fashion, staying only a few meters\\naway. Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the two concentric circles\\nof the compass hanging in the cabin. At a mere gesture from him, the\\nhelmsman would instantly change the Nautilus’s heading.\\n\\nStanding by the port deadlight, I spotted magnificent coral\\nsubstructures, zoophytes, algae, and crustaceans with enormous\\nquivering claws that stretched forth from crevices in the rock.\\n\\nAt 10:15 Captain Nemo himself took the helm. Dark and deep, a wide\\ngallery opened ahead of us. The Nautilus was brazenly swallowed\\nup. Strange rumblings were audible along our sides. It was the water\\nof the Red Sea, hurled toward the Mediterranean by the tunnel’s\\nslope. Our engines tried to offer resistance by churning the waves\\nwith propeller in reverse, but the Nautilus went with the torrent, as\\nswift as an arrow.\\n\\nAlong the narrow walls of this passageway, I saw only brilliant\\nstreaks, hard lines, fiery furrows, all scrawled by our speeding\\nelectric light. With my hand I tried to curb the pounding of my heart.\\n\\nAt 10:35 Captain Nemo left the steering wheel and turned to me:\\n\\n“The Mediterranean,” he told me.\\n\\nIn less than twenty minutes, swept along by the torrent, the Nautilus\\nhad just cleared the Isthmus of Suez.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nThe Greek Islands\\n\\n\\nAT SUNRISE the next morning, February 12, the Nautilus rose to the\\nsurface of the waves.\\n\\nI rushed onto the platform. The hazy silhouette of Pelusium was\\noutlined three miles to the south. A torrent had carried us from one\\nsea to the other. But although that tunnel was easy to descend, going\\nback up must have been impossible.\\n\\nNear seven o’clock Ned and Conseil joined me. Those two inseparable\\ncompanions had slept serenely, utterly unaware of the Nautilus’s feat.\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Naturalist,” the Canadian asked in a gently mocking tone,\\n“and how about that Mediterranean?”\\n\\n“We’re floating on its surface, Ned my friend.”\\n\\n“What!” Conseil put in. “Last night . . . ?”\\n\\n“Yes, last night, in a matter of minutes, we cleared that insuperable\\nisthmus.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe a word of it,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“And you’re in the wrong, Mr. Land,” I went on. “That flat coastline\\ncurving southward is the coast of Egypt.”\\n\\n“Tell it to the marines, sir,” answered the stubborn Canadian.\\n\\n“But if master says so,” Conseil told him, “then so be it.”\\n\\n“What’s more, Ned,” I said, “Captain Nemo himself did the honors in\\nhis tunnel, and I stood beside him in the pilothouse while he steered\\nthe Nautilus through that narrow passageway.”\\n\\n“You hear, Ned?” Conseil said.\\n\\n“And you, Ned, who have such good eyes,” I added, “you can spot the\\njetties of Port Said stretching out to sea.”\\n\\nThe Canadian looked carefully.\\n\\n“Correct,” he said. “You’re right, professor, and your captain’s a\\nsuperman. We’re in the Mediterranean. Fine. So now let’s have a chat\\nabout our little doings, if you please, but in such a way that nobody\\noverhears.”\\n\\nI could easily see what the Canadian was driving at. In any event, I\\nthought it best to let him have his chat, and we all three went to sit\\nnext to the beacon, where we were less exposed to the damp spray from\\nthe billows.\\n\\n“Now, Ned, we’re all ears,” I said. “What have you to tell us?”\\n\\n“What I’ve got to tell you is very simple,” the Canadian\\nreplied. “We’re in Europe, and before Captain Nemo’s whims take us\\ndeep into the polar seas or back to Oceania, I say we should leave\\nthis Nautilus.”\\n\\nI confess that such discussions with the Canadian always baffled me. I\\ndidn’t want to restrict my companions’ freedom in any way, and yet I\\nhad no desire to leave Captain Nemo. Thanks to him and his\\nsubmersible, I was finishing my undersea research by the day, and I\\nwas rewriting my book on the great ocean depths in the midst of its\\nvery element. Would I ever again have such an opportunity to observe\\nthe ocean’s wonders? Absolutely not! So I couldn’t entertain this idea\\nof leaving the Nautilus before completing our course of inquiry.\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” I said, “answer me honestly. Are you bored with this\\nship? Are you sorry that fate has cast you into Captain Nemo’s hands?”\\n\\nThe Canadian paused for a short while before replying. Then, crossing\\nhis arms:\\n\\n“Honestly,” he said, “I’m not sorry about this voyage under the\\nseas. I’ll be glad to have done it, but in order to have done it, it\\nhas to finish. That’s my feeling.”\\n\\n“It will finish, Ned.”\\n\\n“Where and when?”\\n\\n“Where? I don’t know. When? I can’t say. Or, rather, I suppose it will\\nbe over when these seas have nothing more to teach us. Everything that\\nbegins in this world must inevitably come to an end.”\\n\\n“I think as master does,” Conseil replied, “and it’s extremely\\npossible that after crossing every sea on the globe, Captain Nemo will\\nbid the three of us a fond farewell.”\\n\\n“Bid us a fond farewell?” the Canadian exclaimed. “You mean beat us to\\na fare-thee-well!”\\n\\n“Let’s not exaggerate, Mr. Land,” I went on. “We have nothing to fear\\nfrom the captain, but neither do I share Conseil’s views. We’re privy\\nto the Nautilus’s secrets, and I don’t expect that its commander, just\\nto set us free, will meekly stand by while we spread those secrets all\\nover the world.”\\n\\n“But in that case what do you expect?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“That we’ll encounter advantageous conditions for escaping just as\\nreadily in six months as now.”\\n\\n“Great Scott!” Ned Land put in. “And where, if you please, will we be\\nin six months, Mr. Naturalist?”\\n\\n“Perhaps here, perhaps in China. You know how quickly the Nautilus\\nmoves. It crosses oceans like swallows cross the air or express trains\\ncontinents. It doesn’t fear heavily traveled seas. Who can say it\\nwon’t hug the coasts of France, England, or America, where an escape\\nattempt could be carried out just as effectively as here.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” the Canadian replied, “your arguments are rotten\\nto the core. You talk way off in the future: ‘We’ll be here, we’ll be\\nthere!’ Me, I’m talking about right now: we are here, and we must take\\nadvantage of it!”\\n\\nI was hard pressed by Ned Land’s common sense, and I felt myself\\nlosing ground. I no longer knew what arguments to put forward on my\\nbehalf.\\n\\n“Sir,” Ned went on, “let’s suppose that by some impossibility, Captain\\nNemo offered your freedom to you this very day. Would you accept?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” I replied.\\n\\n“And suppose he adds that this offer he’s making you today won’t ever\\nbe repeated, then would you accept?”\\n\\nI did not reply.\\n\\n“And what thinks our friend Conseil?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\n“Your friend Conseil,” the fine lad replied serenely, “has nothing to\\nsay for himself. He’s a completely disinterested party on this\\nquestion. Like his master, like his comrade Ned, he’s a\\nbachelor. Neither wife, parents, nor children are waiting for him back\\nhome. He’s in master’s employ, he thinks like master, he speaks like\\nmaster, and much to his regret, he can’t be counted on to form a\\nmajority. Only two persons face each other here: master on one side,\\nNed Land on the other. That said, your friend Conseil is listening,\\nand he’s ready to keep score.”\\n\\nI couldn’t help smiling as Conseil wiped himself out of\\nexistence. Deep down, the Canadian must have been overjoyed at not\\nhaving to contend with him.\\n\\n“Then, sir,” Ned Land said, “since Conseil is no more, we’ll have this\\ndiscussion between just the two of us. I’ve talked, you’ve\\nlistened. What’s your reply?”\\n\\nIt was obvious that the matter had to be settled, and evasions were\\ndistasteful to me.\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” I said, “here’s my reply. You have right on your side\\nand my arguments can’t stand up to yours. It will never do to count on\\nCaptain Nemo’s benevolence. The most ordinary good sense would forbid\\nhim to set us free. On the other hand, good sense decrees that we take\\nadvantage of our first opportunity to leave the Nautilus.”\\n\\n“Fine, Professor Aronnax, that’s wisely said.”\\n\\n“But one proviso,” I said, “just one. The opportunity must be the real\\nthing. Our first attempt to escape must succeed, because if it\\nmisfires, we won’t get a second chance, and Captain Nemo will never\\nforgive us.”\\n\\n“That’s also well put,” the Canadian replied. “But your proviso\\napplies to any escape attempt, whether it happens in two years or two\\ndays. So this is still the question: if a promising opportunity comes\\nup, we have to grab it.”\\n\\n“Agreed. And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by a promising\\nopportunity?”\\n\\n“One that leads the Nautilus on a cloudy night within a short distance\\nof some European coast.”\\n\\n“And you’ll try to get away by swimming?”\\n\\n“Yes, if we’re close enough to shore and the ship’s afloat on the\\nsurface. No, if we’re well out and the ship’s navigating under the\\nwaters.”\\n\\n“And in that event?”\\n\\n“In that event I’ll try to get hold of the skiff. I know how to handle\\nit. We’ll stick ourselves inside, undo the bolts, and rise to the\\nsurface, without the helmsman in the bow seeing a thing.”\\n\\n“Fine, Ned. Stay on the lookout for such an opportunity, but don’t\\nforget, one slipup will finish us.”\\n\\n“I won’t forget, sir.”\\n\\n“And now, Ned, would you like to know my overall thinking on your\\nplan?”\\n\\n“Gladly, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“Well then, I think—and I don’t mean ‘I hope’—that your promising\\nopportunity won’t ever arise.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Because Captain Nemo recognizes that we haven’t given up all hope of\\nrecovering our freedom, and he’ll keep on his guard, above all in seas\\nwithin sight of the coasts of Europe.”\\n\\n“I’m of master’s opinion,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“We’ll soon see,” Ned Land replied, shaking his head with a determined\\nexpression.\\n\\n“And now, Ned Land,” I added, “let’s leave it at that. Not another\\nword on any of this. The day you’re ready, alert us and we’re with\\nyou. I turn it all over to you.”\\n\\nThat’s how we ended this conversation, which later was to have such\\nserious consequences. At first, I must say, events seemed to confirm\\nmy forecasts, much to the Canadian’s despair. Did Captain Nemo view us\\nwith distrust in these heavily traveled seas, or did he simply want to\\nhide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the\\nMediterranean? I have no idea, but usually he stayed in midwater and\\nwell out from any coast. Either the Nautilus surfaced only enough to\\nlet its pilothouse emerge, or it slipped away to the lower depths,\\nalthough, between the Greek Islands and Asia Minor, we didn’t find\\nbottom even at 2,000 meters down.\\n\\nAccordingly, I became aware of the isle of Karpathos, one of the\\nSporades Islands, only when Captain Nemo placed his finger over a spot\\non the world map and quoted me this verse from Virgil:\\n\\nEst in Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates\\n\\nCaeruleus Proteus . . .*\\n\\n*Latin: “There in King Neptune’s domain by Karpathos, his spokesman /\\n is azure-hued Proteus . . . ” Ed.\\n\\nIt was indeed that bygone abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of King\\nNeptune’s flocks: an island located between Rhodes and Crete, which\\nGreeks now call Karpathos, Italians Scarpanto. Through the lounge\\nwindow I could see only its granite bedrock.\\n\\nThe next day, February 14, I decided to spend a few hours studying the\\nfish of this island group; but for whatever reason, the panels\\nremained hermetically sealed. After determining the Nautilus’s\\nheading, I noted that it was proceeding toward the ancient island of\\nCrete, also called Candia. At the time I had shipped aboard the\\nAbraham Lincoln, this whole island was in rebellion against its\\ntyrannical rulers, the Ottoman Empire of Turkey. But since then I had\\nabsolutely no idea what happened to this revolution, and Captain Nemo,\\ndeprived of all contact with the shore, was hardly the man to keep me\\ninformed.\\n\\nSo I didn’t allude to this event when, that evening, I chanced to be\\nalone with the captain in the lounge. Besides, he seemed silent and\\npreoccupied. Then, contrary to custom, he ordered that both panels in\\nthe lounge be opened, and going from the one to the other, he\\ncarefully observed the watery mass. For what purpose? I hadn’t a\\nguess, and for my part, I spent my time studying the fish that passed\\nbefore my eyes.\\n\\nAmong others I noted that sand goby mentioned by Aristotle and\\ncommonly known by the name sea loach, which is encountered exclusively\\nin the salty waters next to the Nile Delta. Near them some\\nsemiphosphorescent red porgy rolled by, a variety of gilthead that the\\nEgyptians ranked among their sacred animals, lauding them in religious\\nceremonies when their arrival in the river’s waters announced the\\nfertile flood season. I also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro,\\nthree decimeters long, bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish\\ngray color is mixed with red spots; they’re enthusiastic eaters of\\nmarine vegetables, which gives them an exquisite flavor; hence these\\ntapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient Rome, and their\\nentrails were dressed with brains of peacock, tongue of flamingo, and\\ntestes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the\\nRoman emperor Vitellius.\\n\\nAnother resident of these seas caught my attention and revived all my\\nmemories of antiquity. This was the remora, which travels attached to\\nthe bellies of sharks; as the ancients tell it, when these little fish\\ncling to the undersides of a ship, they can bring it to a halt, and by\\nso impeding\\n\\nMark Antony’s vessel during the Battle of Actium, one of them\\nfacilitated the victory of Augustus Caesar. From such slender threads\\nhang the destinies of nations! I also observed some wonderful snappers\\nbelonging to the order Lutianida, sacred fish for the Greeks, who\\nclaimed they could drive off sea monsters from the waters they\\nfrequent; their Greek name anthias means “flower,” and they live up to\\nit in the play of their colors and in those fleeting reflections that\\nturn their dorsal fins into watered silk; their hues are confined to a\\ngamut of reds, from the pallor of pink to the glow of ruby. I couldn’t\\ntake my eyes off these marine wonders, when I was suddenly jolted by\\nan unexpected apparition.\\n\\nIn the midst of the waters, a man appeared, a diver carrying a little\\nleather bag at his belt. It was no corpse lost in the waves. It was a\\nliving man, swimming vigorously, sometimes disappearing to breathe at\\nthe surface, then instantly diving again.\\n\\nI turned to Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice:\\n\\n“A man! A castaway!” I exclaimed. “We must rescue him at all cost!”\\n\\nThe captain didn’t reply but went to lean against the window.\\n\\nThe man drew near, and gluing his face to the panel, he stared at us.\\n\\nTo my deep astonishment, Captain Nemo gave him a signal. The diver\\nanswered with his hand, immediately swam up to the surface of the sea,\\nand didn’t reappear.\\n\\n“Don’t be alarmed,” the captain told me. “That’s Nicolas from Cape\\nMatapan, nicknamed ‘Il Pesce.’* He’s well known throughout the\\nCyclades Islands. A bold diver! Water is his true element, and he\\nlives in the sea more than on shore, going constantly from one island\\nto another, even to Crete.”\\n\\n*Italian: “The Fish.” Ed.\\n\\n“You know him, captain?”\\n\\n“Why not, Professor Aronnax?”\\n\\nThis said, Captain Nemo went to a cabinet standing near the lounge’s\\nleft panel. Next to this cabinet I saw a chest bound with hoops of\\niron, its lid bearing a copper plaque that displayed the Nautilus’s\\nmonogram with its motto Mobilis in Mobili.\\n\\nJust then, ignoring my presence, the captain opened this cabinet, a\\nsort of safe that contained a large number of ingots.\\n\\nThey were gold ingots. And they represented an enormous sum of\\nmoney. Where had this precious metal come from? How had the captain\\namassed this gold, and what was he about to do with it?\\n\\nI didn’t pronounce a word. I gaped. Captain Nemo took out the ingots\\none by one and arranged them methodically inside the chest, filling it\\nto the top. At which point I estimate that it held more than 1,000\\nkilograms of gold, in other words, close to 5,000,000 francs.\\n\\nAfter securely fastening the chest, Captain Nemo wrote an address on\\nits lid in characters that must have been modern Greek.\\n\\nThis done, the captain pressed a button whose wiring was in\\ncommunication with the crew’s quarters. Four men appeared and, not\\nwithout difficulty, pushed the chest out of the lounge. Then I heard\\nthem hoist it up the iron companionway by means of pulleys.\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo turned to me:\\n\\n“You were saying, professor?” he asked me.\\n\\n“I wasn’t saying a thing, captain.”\\n\\n“Then, sir, with your permission, I’ll bid you good evening.”\\n\\nAnd with that, Captain Nemo left the lounge.\\n\\nI reentered my stateroom, very puzzled, as you can imagine. I tried in\\nvain to fall asleep. I kept searching for a relationship between the\\nappearance of the diver and that chest filled with gold. Soon, from\\ncertain rolling and pitching movements, I sensed that the Nautilus had\\nleft the lower strata and was back on the surface of the water.\\n\\nThen I heard the sound of footsteps on the platform. I realized that\\nthe skiff was being detached and launched to sea. For an instant it\\nbumped the Nautilus’s side, then all sounds ceased.\\n\\nTwo hours later, the same noises, the same comings and goings, were\\nrepeated. Hoisted on board, the longboat was readjusted into its\\nsocket, and the Nautilus plunged back beneath the waves.\\n\\nSo those millions had been delivered to their address. At what spot on\\nthe continent? Who was the recipient of Captain Nemo’s gold?\\n\\nThe next day I related the night’s events to Conseil and the Canadian,\\nevents that had aroused my curiosity to a fever pitch. My companions\\nwere as startled as I was.\\n\\n“But where does he get those millions?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\nTo this no reply was possible. After breakfast I made my way to the\\nlounge and went about my work. I wrote up my notes until five o’clock\\nin the afternoon. Just then—was it due to some personal\\nindisposition?—I felt extremely hot and had to take off my jacket made\\nof fan mussel fabric. A perplexing circumstance because we weren’t in\\nthe low latitudes, and besides, once the Nautilus was submerged, it\\nshouldn’t be subject to any rise in temperature. I looked at the\\npressure gauge. It marked a depth of sixty feet, a depth beyond the\\nreach of atmospheric heat.\\n\\nI kept on working, but the temperature rose to the point of becoming\\nunbearable.\\n\\n“Could there be a fire on board?” I wondered.\\n\\nI was about to leave the lounge when Captain Nemo entered. He\\napproached the thermometer, consulted it, and turned to me:\\n\\n“42 degrees centigrade,” he said.\\n\\n“I’ve detected as much, captain,” I replied, “and if it gets even\\nslightly hotter, we won’t be able to stand it.”\\n\\n“Oh, professor, it won’t get any hotter unless we want it to!”\\n\\n“You mean you can control this heat?”\\n\\n“No, but I can back away from the fireplace producing it.”\\n\\n“So it’s outside?”\\n\\n“Surely. We’re cruising in a current of boiling water.”\\n\\n“It can’t be!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Look.”\\n\\nThe panels had opened, and I could see a completely white sea around\\nthe Nautilus. Steaming sulfurous fumes uncoiled in the midst of waves\\nbubbling like water in a boiler. I leaned my hand against one of the\\nwindows, but the heat was so great, I had to snatch it back.\\n\\n“Where are we?” I asked.\\n\\n“Near the island of Santorini, professor,” the captain answered me,\\n“and right in the channel that separates the volcanic islets of Nea\\nKameni and Palea Kameni. I wanted to offer you the unusual sight of an\\nunderwater eruption.”\\n\\n“I thought,” I said, “that the formation of such new islands had come\\nto an end.”\\n\\n“Nothing ever comes to an end in these volcanic waterways,” Captain\\nNemo replied, “and thanks to its underground fires, our globe is\\ncontinuously under construction in these regions. According to the\\nLatin historians Cassiodorus and Pliny, by the year 19 of the\\nChristian era, a new island, the divine Thera, had already appeared in\\nthe very place these islets have more recently formed. Then Thera sank\\nunder the waves, only to rise and sink once more in the year 69\\nA.D. From that day to this, such plutonic construction work has been\\nin abeyance. But on February 3, 1866, a new islet named George Island\\nemerged in the midst of sulfurous steam near Nea Kameni and was fused\\nto it on the 6th of the same month. Seven days later, on February 13,\\nthe islet of Aphroessa appeared, leaving a ten-meter channel between\\nitself and Nea Kameni. I was in these seas when that phenomenon\\noccurred and I was able to observe its every phase. The islet of\\nAphroessa was circular in shape, measuring 300 feet in diameter and\\nthirty feet in height. It was made of black, glassy lava mixed with\\nbits of feldspar. Finally, on March 10, a smaller islet called Reka\\nappeared next to Nea Kameni, and since then, these three islets have\\nfused to form one single, selfsame island.”\\n\\n“What about this channel we’re in right now?” I asked.\\n\\n“Here it is,” Captain Nemo replied, showing me a chart of the Greek\\nIslands. “You observe that I’ve entered the new islets in their\\nplace.”\\n\\n“But will this channel fill up one day?”\\n\\n“Very likely, Professor Aronnax, because since 1866 eight little lava\\nislets have surged up in front of the port of St. Nicolas on Palea\\nKameni. So it’s obvious that Nea and Palea will join in days to\\ncome. In the middle of the Pacific, tiny infusoria build continents,\\nbut here they’re built by volcanic phenomena. Look, sir! Look at the\\nconstruction work going on under these waves.”\\n\\nI returned to the window. The Nautilus was no longer moving. The heat\\nhad become unbearable. From the white it had recently been, the sea\\nwas turning red, a coloration caused by the presence of iron\\nsalts. Although the lounge was hermetically sealed, it was filling\\nwith an intolerable stink of sulfur, and I could see scarlet flames of\\nsuch brightness, they overpowered our electric light.\\n\\nI was swimming in perspiration, I was stifling, I was about to be\\ncooked. Yes, I felt myself cooking in actual fact!\\n\\n“We can’t stay any longer in this boiling water,” I told the captain.\\n\\n“No, it wouldn’t be advisable,” replied Nemo the Emotionless.\\n\\nHe gave an order. The Nautilus tacked about and retreated from this\\nfurnace it couldn’t brave with impunity. A quarter of an hour later,\\nwe were breathing fresh air on the surface of the waves.\\n\\nIt then occurred to me that if Ned had chosen these waterways for our\\nescape attempt, we wouldn’t have come out alive from this sea of fire.\\n\\nThe next day, February 16, we left this basin, which tallies depths of\\n3,000 meters between Rhodes and Alexandria, and passing well out from\\nCerigo Island after doubling Cape Matapan, the Nautilus left the Greek\\nIslands behind.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nThe Mediterranean in Forty-Eight Hours\\n\\n\\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN, your ideal blue sea: to Greeks simply “the sea,” to\\nHebrews “the great sea,” to Romans mare nostrum.* Bordered by orange\\ntrees, aloes, cactus, and maritime pine trees, perfumed with the scent\\nof myrtle, framed by rugged mountains, saturated with clean,\\ntransparent air but continuously under construction by fires in the\\nearth, this sea is a genuine battlefield where Neptune and Pluto still\\nstruggle for world domination. Here on these beaches and waters, says\\nthe French historian Michelet, a man is revived by one of the most\\ninvigorating climates in the world.\\n\\n*Latin: “our sea.” Ed.\\n\\nBut as beautiful as it was, I could get only a quick look at this\\nbasin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers. Even\\nCaptain Nemo’s personal insights were denied me, because that\\nmystifying individual didn’t appear one single time during our\\nhigh-speed crossing. I estimate that the Nautilus covered a track of\\nsome 600 leagues under the waves of this sea, and this voyage was\\naccomplished in just twenty-four hours times two. Departing from the\\nwaterways of Greece on the morning of February 16, we cleared the\\nStrait of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.\\n\\nIt was obvious to me that this Mediterranean, pinned in the middle of\\nthose shores he wanted to avoid, gave Captain Nemo no pleasure. Its\\nwaves and breezes brought back too many memories, if not too many\\nregrets. Here he no longer had the ease of movement and freedom of\\nmaneuver that the oceans allowed him, and his Nautilus felt cramped so\\nclose to the coasts of both Africa and Europe.\\n\\nAccordingly, our speed was twenty-five miles (that is, twelve\\nfour-kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to\\ngive up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the\\nrate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use\\nof the skiff. Leaving the Nautilus under these conditions would have\\nbeen like jumping off a train racing at this speed, a rash move if\\nthere ever was one. Moreover, to renew our air supply, the submersible\\nrose to the surface of the waves only at night, and relying solely on\\ncompass and log, it steered by dead reckoning.\\n\\nInside the Mediterranean, then, I could catch no more of its\\nfast-passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train;\\nin other words, I could view only the distant horizons because the\\nforegrounds flashed by like lightning. But Conseil and I were able to\\nobserve those Mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a\\nwhile in the Nautilus’s waters. We stayed on watch before the lounge\\nwindows, and our notes enable me to reconstruct, in a few words, the\\nichthyology of this sea.\\n\\nAmong the various fish inhabiting it, some I viewed, others I\\nglimpsed, and the rest I missed completely because of the Nautilus’s\\nspeed. Kindly allow me to sort them out using this whimsical system of\\nclassification. It will at least convey the quickness of my\\nobservations.\\n\\nIn the midst of the watery mass, brightly lit by our electric beams,\\nthere snaked past those one-meter lampreys that are common to nearly\\nevery clime. A type of ray from the genus Oxyrhynchus, five feet wide,\\nhad a white belly with a spotted, ash-gray back and was carried along\\nby the currents like a huge, wide-open shawl. Other rays passed by so\\nquickly I couldn’t tell if they deserved that name “eagle ray” coined\\nby the ancient Greeks, or those designations of “rat ray,” “bat ray,”\\nand “toad ray” that modern fishermen have inflicted on them. Dogfish\\nknown as topes, twelve feet long and especially feared by divers, were\\nracing with each other. Looking like big bluish shadows, thresher\\nsharks went by, eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute\\nsense of smell. Dorados from the genus Sparus, some measuring up to\\nthirteen decimeters, appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled\\nwith ribbons, which contrasted with the dark color of their fins; fish\\nsacred to the goddess Venus, their eyes set in brows of gold; a\\nvaluable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt, equally at\\nhome in rivers, lakes, and oceans, living in every clime, tolerating\\nany temperature, their line dating back to prehistoric times on this\\nearth yet preserving all its beauty from those far-off\\ndays. Magnificent sturgeons, nine to ten meters long and extremely\\nfast, banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels,\\nshowing bluish backs with small brown spots; they resemble sharks,\\nwithout equaling their strength, and are encountered in every sea; in\\nthe spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers, fighting the\\ncurrents of the Volga, Danube, Po, Rhine, Loire, and Oder, while\\nfeeding on herring, mackerel, salmon, and codfish; although they\\nbelong to the class of cartilaginous fish, they rate as a delicacy;\\nthey’re eaten fresh, dried, marinated, or salt-preserved, and in olden\\ntimes they were borne in triumph to the table of the Roman epicure\\nLucullus.\\n\\nBut whenever the Nautilus drew near the surface, those denizens of the\\nMediterranean I could observe most productively belonged to the\\nsixty-third genus of bony fish. These were tuna from the genus\\nScomber, blue-black on top, silver on the belly armor, their dorsal\\nstripes giving off a golden gleam. They are said to follow ships in\\nsearch of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun, and they did\\njust that with the Nautilus, as they had once done with the vessels of\\nthe Count de La PΘrouse. For long hours they competed in speed with\\nour submersible. I couldn’t stop marveling at these animals so\\nperfectly cut out for racing, their heads small, their bodies sleek,\\nspindle-shaped, and in some cases over three meters long, their\\npectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength, their caudal fins\\nforked. Like certain flocks of birds, whose speed they equal, these\\ntuna swim in triangle formation, which prompted the ancients to say\\nthey’d boned up on geometry and military strategy. And yet they can’t\\nescape the Provenτal fishermen, who prize them as highly as did the\\nancient inhabitants of Turkey and Italy; and these valuable animals,\\nas oblivious as if they were deaf and blind, leap right into the\\nMarseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands.\\n\\nJust for the record, I’ll mention those Mediterranean fish that\\nConseil and I barely glimpsed. There were whitish eels of the species\\nGymnotus fasciatus that passed like elusive wisps of steam, conger\\neels three to four meters long that were tricked out in green, blue,\\nand yellow, three-foot hake with a liver that makes a dainty morsel,\\nwormfish drifting like thin seaweed, sea robins that poets call\\nlyrefish and seamen pipers and whose snouts have two jagged triangular\\nplates shaped like old Homer’s lyre, swallowfish swimming as fast as\\nthe bird they’re named after, redheaded groupers whose dorsal fins are\\ntrimmed with filaments, some shad (spotted with black, gray, brown,\\nblue, yellow, and green) that actually respond to tinkling handbells,\\nsplendid diamond-shaped turbot that were like aquatic pheasants with\\nyellowish fins stippled in brown and the left topside mostly marbled\\nin brown and yellow, finally schools of wonderful red mullet, real\\noceanic birds of paradise that ancient Romans bought for as much as\\n10,000 sesterces apiece, and which they killed at the table, so they\\ncould heartlessly watch it change color from cinnabar red when alive\\nto pallid white when dead.\\n\\nAnd as for other fish common to the Atlantic and Mediterranean, I was\\nunable to observe miralets, triggerfish, puffers, seahorses,\\njewelfish, trumpetfish, blennies, gray mullet, wrasse, smelt, flying\\nfish, anchovies, sea bream, porgies, garfish, or any of the chief\\nrepresentatives of the order Pleuronecta, such as sole, flounder,\\nplaice, dab, and brill, simply because of the dizzying speed with\\nwhich the Nautilus hustled through these opulent waters.\\n\\nAs for marine mammals, on passing by the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, I\\nthought I recognized two or three sperm whales equipped with the\\nsingle dorsal fin denoting the genus Physeter, some pilot whales from\\nthe genus Globicephalus exclusive to the Mediterranean, the forepart\\nof the head striped with small distinct lines, and also a dozen seals\\nwith white bellies and black coats, known by the name monk seals and\\njust as solemn as if they were three-meter Dominicans.\\n\\nFor his part, Conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide and\\nadorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise. I was sorry\\nto miss this reptile, because from Conseil’s description, I believe I\\nrecognized the leatherback turtle, a pretty rare species. For my part,\\nI noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces.\\n\\nAs for zoophytes, for a few moments I was able to marvel at a\\nwonderful, orange-hued hydra from the genus Galeolaria that clung to\\nthe glass of our port panel; it consisted of a long, lean filament\\nthat spread out into countless branches and ended in the most delicate\\nlace ever spun by the followers of Arachne. Unfortunately I couldn’t\\nfish up this wonderful specimen, and surely no other Mediterranean\\nzoophytes would have been offered to my gaze, if, on the evening of\\nthe 16th, the Nautilus hadn’t slowed down in an odd fashion. This was\\nthe situation.\\n\\nBy then we were passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunisia. In\\nthe cramped space between Cape Bon and the Strait of Messina, the sea\\nbottom rises almost all at once. It forms an actual ridge with only\\nseventeen meters of water remaining above it, while the depth on\\neither side is 170 meters. Consequently, the Nautilus had to maneuver\\nwith caution so as not to bump into this underwater barrier.\\n\\nI showed Conseil the position of this long reef on our chart of the\\nMediterranean.\\n\\n“But with all due respect to master,” Conseil ventured to observe,\\n“it’s like an actual isthmus connecting Europe to Africa.”\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” I replied, “it cuts across the whole Strait of Sicily,\\nand Smith’s soundings prove that in the past, these two continents\\nwere genuinely connected between Cape Boeo and Cape Farina.”\\n\\n“I can easily believe it,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“I might add,” I went on, “that there’s a similar barrier between\\nGibraltar and Ceuta, and in prehistoric times it closed off the\\nMediterranean completely.”\\n\\n“Gracious!” Conseil put in. “Suppose one day some volcanic upheaval\\nraises these two barriers back above the waves!”\\n\\n“That’s most unlikely, Conseil.”\\n\\n“If master will allow me to finish, I mean that if this phenomenon\\noccurs, it might prove distressing to Mr. de Lesseps, who has gone to\\nsuch pains to cut through his isthmus!”\\n\\n“Agreed, but I repeat, Conseil: such a phenomenon won’t occur. The\\nintensity of these underground forces continues to diminish. Volcanoes\\nwere quite numerous in the world’s early days, but they’re going\\nextinct one by one; the heat inside the earth is growing weaker, the\\ntemperature in the globe’s lower strata is cooling appreciably every\\ncentury, and to our globe’s detriment, because its heat is its life.”\\n\\n“But the sun—”\\n\\n“The sun isn’t enough, Conseil. Can it restore heat to a corpse?”\\n\\n“Not that I’ve heard.”\\n\\n“Well, my friend, someday the earth will be just such a cold\\ncorpse. Like the moon, which long ago lost its vital heat, our globe\\nwill become lifeless and unlivable.”\\n\\n“In how many centuries?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“In hundreds of thousands of years, my boy.”\\n\\n“Then we have ample time to finish our voyage,” Conseil replied, “if\\nNed Land doesn’t mess things up!”\\n\\nThus reassured, Conseil went back to studying the shallows that the\\nNautilus was skimming at moderate speed.\\n\\nOn the rocky, volcanic seafloor, there bloomed quite a collection of\\nmoving flora: sponges, sea cucumbers, jellyfish called sea\\ngooseberries that were adorned with reddish tendrils and gave off a\\nsubtle phosphorescence, members of the genus Beroe that are commonly\\nknown by the name melon jellyfish and are bathed in the shimmer of the\\nwhole solar spectrum, free-swimming crinoids one meter wide that\\nreddened the waters with their crimson hue, treelike basket stars of\\nthe greatest beauty, sea fans from the genus Pavonacea with long\\nstems, numerous edible sea urchins of various species, plus green sea\\nanemones with a grayish trunk and a brown disk lost beneath the\\nolive-colored tresses of their tentacles.\\n\\nConseil kept especially busy observing mollusks and articulates, and\\nalthough his catalog is a little dry, I wouldn’t want to wrong the\\ngallant lad by leaving out his personal observations.\\n\\nFrom the branch Mollusca, he mentions numerous comb-shaped scallops,\\nhooflike spiny oysters piled on top of each other, triangular coquina,\\nthree-pronged glass snails with yellow fins and transparent shells,\\norange snails from the genus Pleurobranchus that looked like eggs\\nspotted or speckled with greenish dots, members of the genus Aplysia\\nalso known by the name sea hares, other sea hares from the genus\\nDolabella, plump paper-bubble shells, umbrella shells exclusive to the\\nMediterranean, abalone whose shell produces a mother-of-pearl much in\\ndemand, pilgrim scallops, saddle shells that diners in the French\\nprovince of Languedoc are said to like better than oysters, some of\\nthose cockleshells so dear to the citizens of Marseilles, fat white\\nvenus shells that are among the clams so abundant off the coasts of\\nNorth America and eaten in such quantities by New Yorkers, variously\\ncolored comb shells with gill covers, burrowing date mussels with a\\npeppery flavor I relish, furrowed heart cockles whose shells have\\nriblike ridges on their arching summits, triton shells pocked with\\nscarlet bumps, carniaira snails with backward-curving tips that make\\nthem resemble flimsy gondolas, crowned ferola snails, atlanta snails\\nwith spiral shells, gray nudibranchs from the genus Tethys that were\\nspotted with white and covered by fringed mantles, nudibranchs from\\nthe suborder Eolidea that looked like small slugs, sea butterflies\\ncrawling on their backs, seashells from the genus Auricula including\\nthe oval-shaped Auricula myosotis, tan wentletrap snails, common\\nperiwinkles, violet snails, cineraira snails, rock borers, ear shells,\\ncabochon snails, pandora shells, etc.\\n\\nAs for the articulates, in his notes Conseil has very appropriately\\ndivided them into six classes, three of which belong to the marine\\nworld. These classes are the Crustacea, Cirripedia, and Annelida.\\n\\nCrustaceans are subdivided into nine orders, and the first of these\\nconsists of the decapods, in other words, animals whose head and\\nthorax are usually fused, whose cheek-and-mouth mechanism is made up\\nof several pairs of appendages, and whose thorax has four, five, or\\nsix pairs of walking legs. Conseil used the methods of our mentor\\nProfessor Milne-Edwards, who puts the decapods in three divisions:\\nBrachyura, Macrura, and Anomura. These names may look a tad fierce,\\nbut they’re accurate and appropriate. Among the Brachyura, Conseil\\nmentions some amanthia crabs whose fronts were armed with two big\\ndiverging tips, those inachus scorpions that—lord knows why—symbolized\\nwisdom to the ancient Greeks, spider crabs of the massena and\\nspinimane varieties that had probably gone astray in these shallows\\nbecause they usually live in the lower depths, xanthid crabs, pilumna\\ncrabs, rhomboid crabs, granular box crabs (easy on the digestion, as\\nConseil ventured to observe), toothless masked crabs, ebalia crabs,\\ncymopolia crabs, woolly-handed crabs, etc. Among the Macrura (which\\nare subdivided into five families: hardshells, burrowers, crayfish,\\nprawns, and ghost crabs) Conseil mentions some common spiny lobsters\\nwhose females supply a meat highly prized, slipper lobsters or common\\nshrimp, waterside gebia shrimp, and all sorts of edible species, but\\nhe says nothing of the crayfish subdivision that includes the true\\nlobster, because spiny lobsters are the only type in the\\nMediterranean. Finally, among the Anomura, he saw common drocina crabs\\ndwelling inside whatever abandoned seashells they could take over,\\nhomola crabs with spiny fronts, hermit crabs, hairy porcelain crabs,\\netc.\\n\\nThere Conseil’s work came to a halt. He didn’t have time to finish off\\nthe class Crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods,\\namphipods, homopods, isopods, trilobites, branchiopods, ostracods, and\\nentomostraceans. And in order to complete his study of marine\\narticulates, he needed to mention the class Cirripedia, which contains\\nwater fleas and carp lice, plus the class Annelida, which he would\\nhave divided without fail into tubifex worms and dorsibranchian\\nworms. But having gone past the shallows of the Strait of Sicily, the\\nNautilus resumed its usual deep-water speed. From then on, no more\\nmollusks, no more zoophytes, no more articulates. Just a few large\\nfish sweeping by like shadows.\\n\\nDuring the night of February 16-17, we entered the second\\nMediterranean basin, whose maximum depth we found at 3,000 meters. The\\nNautilus, driven downward by its propeller and slanting fins,\\ndescended to the lowest strata of this sea.\\n\\nThere, in place of natural wonders, the watery mass offered some\\nthrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes. In essence, we were then\\ncrossing that part of the whole Mediterranean so fertile in\\ncasualties. From the coast of Algiers to the beaches of Provence, how\\nmany ships have wrecked, how many vessels have vanished! Compared to\\nthe vast liquid plains of the Pacific, the Mediterranean is a mere\\nlake, but it’s an unpredictable lake with fickle waves, today kindly\\nand affectionate to those frail single-masters drifting between a\\ndouble ultramarine of sky and water, tomorrow bad-tempered and\\nturbulent, agitated by the winds, demolishing the strongest ships\\nbeneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop.\\n\\nSo, in our swift cruise through these deep strata, how many vessels I\\nsaw lying on the seafloor, some already caked with coral, others clad\\nonly in a layer of rust, plus anchors, cannons, shells, iron fittings,\\npropeller blades, parts of engines, cracked cylinders, staved-in\\nboilers, then hulls floating in midwater, here upright, there\\noverturned.\\n\\nSome of these wrecked ships had perished in collisions, others from\\nhitting granite reefs. I saw a few that had sunk straight down, their\\nmasting still upright, their rigging stiffened by the water. They\\nlooked like they were at anchor by some immense, open, offshore\\nmooring where they were waiting for their departure time. When the\\nNautilus passed between them, covering them with sheets of\\nelectricity, they seemed ready to salute us with their colors and send\\nus their serial numbers! But no, nothing but silence and death filled\\nthis field of catastrophes!\\n\\nI observed that these Mediterranean depths became more and more\\ncluttered with such gruesome wreckage as the Nautilus drew nearer to\\nthe Strait of Gibraltar. By then the shores of Africa and Europe were\\nconverging, and in this narrow space collisions were\\ncommonplace. There I saw numerous iron undersides, the phantasmagoric\\nruins of steamers, some lying down, others rearing up like fearsome\\nanimals. One of these boats made a dreadful first impression: sides\\ntorn open, funnel bent, paddle wheels stripped to the mountings,\\nrudder separated from the sternpost and still hanging from an iron\\nchain, the board on its stern eaten away by marine salts! How many\\nlives were dashed in this shipwreck! How many victims were swept under\\nthe waves! Had some sailor on board lived to tell the story of this\\ndreadful disaster, or do the waves still keep this casualty a secret?\\nIt occurred to me, lord knows why, that this boat buried under the sea\\nmight have been the Atlas, lost with all hands some twenty years ago\\nand never heard from again! Oh, what a gruesome tale these\\nMediterranean depths could tell, this huge boneyard where so much\\nwealth has been lost, where so many victims have met their deaths!\\n\\nMeanwhile, briskly unconcerned, the Nautilus ran at full propeller\\nthrough the midst of these ruins. On February 18, near three o’clock\\nin the morning, it hove before the entrance to the Strait of\\nGibraltar.\\n\\nThere are two currents here: an upper current, long known to exist,\\nthat carries the ocean’s waters into the Mediterranean basin; then a\\nlower countercurrent, the only present-day proof of its existence\\nbeing logic. In essence, the Mediterranean receives a continual influx\\nof water not only from the Atlantic but from rivers emptying into it;\\nsince local evaporation isn’t enough to restore the balance, the total\\namount of added water should make this sea’s level higher every\\nyear. Yet this isn’t the case, and we’re naturally forced to believe\\nin the existence of some lower current that carries the\\nMediterranean’s surplus through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the\\nAtlantic basin.\\n\\nAnd so it turned out. The Nautilus took full advantage of this\\ncountercurrent. It advanced swiftly through this narrow\\npassageway. For an instant I could glimpse the wonderful ruins of the\\nTemple of Hercules, buried undersea, as Pliny and Avianus have\\nmentioned, together with the flat island they stand on; and a few\\nminutes later, we were floating on the waves of the Atlantic.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\nThe Bay of Vigo\\n\\n\\nTHE ATLANTIC! A vast expanse of water whose surface area is 25,000,000\\nsquare miles, with a length of 9,000 miles and an average width of\\n2,700. A major sea nearly unknown to the ancients, except perhaps the\\nCarthaginians, those Dutchmen of antiquity who went along the west\\ncoasts of Europe and Africa on their commercial junkets! An ocean\\nwhose parallel winding shores form an immense perimeter fed by the\\nworld’s greatest rivers: the St. Lawrence, Mississippi, Amazon, Plata,\\nOrinoco, Niger, Senegal, Elbe, Loire, and Rhine, which bring it waters\\nfrom the most civilized countries as well as the most undeveloped\\nareas! A magnificent plain of waves plowed continuously by ships of\\nevery nation, shaded by every flag in the world, and ending in those\\ntwo dreadful headlands so feared by navigators, Cape Horn and the Cape\\nof Tempests!\\n\\nThe Nautilus broke these waters with the edge of its spur after doing\\nnearly 10,000 leagues in three and a half months, a track longer than\\na great circle of the earth. Where were we heading now, and what did\\nthe future have in store for us?\\n\\nEmerging from the Strait of Gibraltar, the Nautilus took to the high\\nseas. It returned to the surface of the waves, so our daily strolls on\\nthe platform were restored to us.\\n\\nI climbed onto it instantly, Ned Land and Conseil along with\\nme. Twelve miles away, Cape St. Vincent was hazily visible, the\\nsouthwestern tip of the Hispanic peninsula. The wind was blowing a\\npretty strong gust from the south. The sea was swelling and\\nsurging. Its waves made the Nautilus roll and jerk violently. It was\\nnearly impossible to stand up on the platform, which was continuously\\nbuffeted by this enormously heavy sea. After inhaling a few breaths of\\nair, we went below once more.\\n\\nI repaired to my stateroom. Conseil returned to his cabin; but the\\nCanadian, looking rather worried, followed me. Our quick trip through\\nthe Mediterranean hadn’t allowed him to put his plans into execution,\\nand he could barely conceal his disappointment.\\n\\nAfter the door to my stateroom was closed, he sat and stared at me\\nsilently.\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” I told him, “I know how you feel, but you mustn’t\\nblame yourself. Given the way the Nautilus was navigating, it would\\nhave been sheer insanity to think of escaping!”\\n\\nNed Land didn’t reply. His pursed lips and frowning brow indicated\\nthat he was in the grip of his monomania.\\n\\n“Look here,” I went on, “as yet there’s no cause for despair. We’re\\ngoing up the coast of Portugal. France and England aren’t far off, and\\nthere we’ll easily find refuge. Oh, I grant you, if the Nautilus had\\nemerged from the Strait of Gibraltar and made for that cape in the\\nsouth, if it were taking us toward those regions that have no\\ncontinents, then I’d share your alarm. But we now know that Captain\\nNemo doesn’t avoid the seas of civilization, and in a few days I think\\nwe can safely take action.”\\n\\nNed Land stared at me still more intently and finally unpursed his\\nlips:\\n\\n“We’ll do it this evening,” he said.\\n\\nI straightened suddenly. I admit that I was less than ready for this\\nannouncement. I wanted to reply to the Canadian, but words failed me.\\n\\n“We agreed to wait for the right circumstances,” Ned Land went\\non. “Now we’ve got those circumstances. This evening we’ll be just a\\nfew miles off the coast of Spain. It’ll be cloudy tonight. The wind’s\\nblowing toward shore. You gave me your promise, Professor Aronnax, and\\nI’m counting on you.”\\n\\nSince I didn’t say anything, the Canadian stood up and approached me:\\n\\n“We’ll do it this evening at nine o’clock,” he said. “I’ve alerted\\nConseil. By that time Captain Nemo will be locked in his room and\\nprobably in bed. Neither the mechanics or the crewmen will be able to\\nsee us. Conseil and I will go to the central companionway. As for you,\\nProfessor Aronnax, you’ll stay in the library two steps away and wait\\nfor my signal. The oars, mast, and sail are in the skiff. I’ve even\\nmanaged to stow some provisions inside. I’ve gotten hold of a monkey\\nwrench to unscrew the nuts bolting the skiff to the Nautilus’s\\nhull. So everything’s ready. I’ll see you this evening.”\\n\\n“The sea is rough,” I said.\\n\\n“Admitted,” the Canadian replied, “but we’ve got to risk it. Freedom\\nis worth paying for. Besides, the longboat’s solidly built, and a few\\nmiles with the wind behind us is no big deal. By tomorrow, who knows\\nif this ship won’t be 100 leagues out to sea? If circumstances are in\\nour favor, between ten and eleven this evening we’ll be landing on\\nsome piece of solid ground, or we’ll be dead. So we’re in God’s hands,\\nand I’ll see you this evening!”\\n\\nThis said, the Canadian withdrew, leaving me close to dumbfounded. I\\nhad imagined that if it came to this, I would have time to think about\\nit, to talk it over. My stubborn companion hadn’t granted me this\\ncourtesy. But after all, what would I have said to him? Ned Land was\\nright a hundred times over. These were near-ideal circumstances, and\\nhe was taking full advantage of them. In my selfish personal\\ninterests, could I go back on my word and be responsible for ruining\\nthe future lives of my companions? Tomorrow, might not Captain Nemo\\ntake us far away from any shore?\\n\\nJust then a fairly loud hissing told me that the ballast tanks were\\nfilling, and the Nautilus sank beneath the waves of the Atlantic.\\n\\nI stayed in my stateroom. I wanted to avoid the captain, to hide from\\nhis eyes the agitation overwhelming me. What an agonizing day I spent,\\ntorn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at\\nabandoning this marvelous Nautilus, leaving my underwater research\\nincomplete! How could I relinquish this ocean—“my own Atlantic,” as I\\nliked to call it—without observing its lower strata, without wresting\\nfrom it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas\\nof the East Indies and the Pacific! I was putting down my novel half\\nread, I was waking up as my dream neared its climax! How painfully the\\nhours passed, as I sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my\\ncompanions, or, despite my better judgment, as I sometimes wished that\\nsome unforeseen circumstances would prevent Ned Land from carrying out\\nhis plans.\\n\\nTwice I went to the lounge. I wanted to consult the compass. I wanted\\nto see if the Nautilus’s heading was actually taking us closer to the\\ncoast or spiriting us farther away. But no. The Nautilus was still in\\nPortuguese waters. Heading north, it was cruising along the ocean’s\\nbeaches.\\n\\nSo I had to resign myself to my fate and get ready to escape. My\\nbaggage wasn’t heavy. My notes, nothing more.\\n\\nAs for Captain Nemo, I wondered what he would make of our escaping,\\nwhat concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him, and what he\\nwould do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being\\nfound out! Certainly I had no complaints to register with him, on the\\ncontrary. Never was hospitality more wholehearted than his. Yet in\\nleaving him I couldn’t be accused of ingratitude. No solemn promises\\nbound us to him. In order to keep us captive, he had counted only on\\nthe force of circumstances and not on our word of honor. But his\\navowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our\\nevery effort.\\n\\nI hadn’t seen the captain since our visit to the island of\\nSantorini. Would fate bring me into his presence before our departure?\\nI both desired and dreaded it. I listened for footsteps in the\\nstateroom adjoining mine. Not a sound reached my ear. His stateroom\\nhad to be deserted.\\n\\nThen I began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on\\nboard. Since that night when the skiff had left the Nautilus on some\\nmysterious mission, my ideas about him had subtly changed. In spite of\\neverything, I thought that Captain Nemo must have kept up some type of\\nrelationship with the shore. Did he himself never leave the Nautilus?\\nWhole weeks had often gone by without my encountering him. What was he\\ndoing all the while? During all those times I’d thought he was\\nconvalescing in the grip of some misanthropic fit, was he instead far\\naway from the ship, involved in some secret activity whose nature\\nstill eluded me?\\n\\nAll these ideas and a thousand others assaulted me at the same\\ntime. In these strange circumstances the scope for conjecture was\\nunlimited. I felt an unbearable queasiness. This day of waiting seemed\\nendless. The hours struck too slowly to keep up with my impatience.\\n\\nAs usual, dinner was served me in my stateroom. Full of anxiety, I ate\\nlittle. I left the table at seven o’clock. 120 minutes—I was keeping\\ntrack of them—still separated me from the moment I was to rejoin Ned\\nLand. My agitation increased. My pulse was throbbing violently. I\\ncouldn’t stand still. I walked up and down, hoping to calm my troubled\\nmind with movement. The possibility of perishing in our reckless\\nundertaking was the least of my worries; my heart was pounding at the\\nthought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the\\nNautilus, at the thought of being hauled in front of Captain Nemo and\\nfinding him angered, or worse, saddened by my deserting him.\\n\\nI wanted to see the lounge one last time. I went down the gangways and\\narrived at the museum where I had spent so many pleasant and\\nproductive hours. I stared at all its wealth, all its treasures, like\\na man on the eve of his eternal exile, a man departing to return no\\nmore. For so many days now, these natural wonders and artistic\\nmasterworks had been central to my life, and I was about to leave them\\nbehind forever. I wanted to plunge my eyes through the lounge window\\nand into these Atlantic waters; but the panels were hermetically\\nsealed, and a mantle of sheet iron separated me from this ocean with\\nwhich I was still unfamiliar.\\n\\nCrossing through the lounge, I arrived at the door, contrived in one\\nof the canted corners, that opened into the captain’s stateroom. Much\\nto my astonishment, this door was ajar. I instinctively recoiled. If\\nCaptain Nemo was in his stateroom, he might see me. But, not hearing\\nany sounds, I approached. The stateroom was deserted. I pushed the\\ndoor open. I took a few steps inside. Still the same austere, monastic\\nappearance.\\n\\nJust then my eye was caught by some etchings hanging on the wall,\\nwhich I hadn’t noticed during my first visit. They were portraits of\\ngreat men of history who had spent their lives in perpetual devotion\\nto a great human ideal: Thaddeus Kosciusko, the hero whose dying words\\nhad been Finis Poloniae;* Markos Botzaris, for modern Greece the\\nreincarnation of Sparta’s King Leonidas; Daniel O’Connell, Ireland’s\\ndefender; George Washington, founder of the American Union; Daniele\\nManin, the Italian patriot; Abraham Lincoln, dead from the bullet of a\\nbeliever in slavery; and finally, that martyr for the redemption of\\nthe black race, John Brown, hanging from his gallows as Victor Hugo’s\\npencil has so terrifyingly depicted.\\n\\n*Latin: “Save Poland’s borders.” Ed.\\n\\nWhat was the bond between these heroic souls and the soul of Captain\\nNemo? From this collection of portraits could I finally unravel the\\nmystery of his existence? Was he a fighter for oppressed peoples, a\\nliberator of enslaved races? Had he figured in the recent political or\\nsocial upheavals of this century? Was he a hero of that dreadful civil\\nwar in America, a war lamentable yet forever glorious . . . ?\\n\\nSuddenly the clock struck eight. The first stroke of its hammer on the\\nchime snapped me out of my musings. I shuddered as if some invisible\\neye had plunged into my innermost thoughts, and I rushed outside the\\nstateroom.\\n\\nThere my eyes fell on the compass. Our heading was still\\nnortherly. The log indicated a moderate speed, the pressure gauge a\\ndepth of about sixty feet. So circumstances were in favor of the\\nCanadian’s plans.\\n\\nI stayed in my stateroom. I dressed warmly: fishing boots, otter cap,\\ncoat of fan-mussel fabric lined with sealskin. I was ready. I was\\nwaiting. Only the propeller’s vibrations disturbed the deep silence\\nreigning on board. I cocked an ear and listened. Would a sudden\\noutburst of voices tell me that Ned Land’s escape plans had just been\\ndetected? A ghastly uneasiness stole through me. I tried in vain to\\nrecover my composure.\\n\\nA few minutes before nine o’clock, I glued my ear to the captain’s\\ndoor. Not a sound. I left my stateroom and returned to the lounge,\\nwhich was deserted and plunged in near darkness.\\n\\nI opened the door leading to the library. The same inadequate light,\\nthe same solitude. I went to man my post near the door opening into\\nthe well of the central companionway. I waited for Ned Land’s signal.\\n\\nAt this point the propeller’s vibrations slowed down appreciably, then\\nthey died out altogether. Why was the Nautilus stopping? Whether this\\nlayover would help or hinder Ned Land’s schemes I couldn’t have said.\\n\\nThe silence was further disturbed only by the pounding of my heart.\\n\\nSuddenly I felt a mild jolt. I realized the Nautilus had come to rest\\non the ocean floor. My alarm increased. The Canadian’s signal hadn’t\\nreached me. I longed to rejoin Ned Land and urge him to postpone his\\nattempt. I sensed that we were no longer navigating under normal\\nconditions.\\n\\nJust then the door to the main lounge opened and Captain Nemo\\nappeared. He saw me, and without further preamble:\\n\\n“Ah, professor,” he said in an affable tone, “I’ve been looking for\\nyou. Do you know your Spanish history?”\\n\\nEven if he knew it by heart, a man in my disturbed, befuddled\\ncondition couldn’t have quoted a syllable of his own country’s\\nhistory.\\n\\n“Well?” Captain Nemo went on. “Did you hear my question? Do you know\\nthe history of Spain?”\\n\\n“Very little of it,” I replied.\\n\\n“The most learned men,” the captain said, “still have much to\\nlearn. Have a seat,” he added, “and I’ll tell you about an unusual\\nepisode in this body of history.”\\n\\nThe captain stretched out on a couch, and I mechanically took a seat\\nnear him, but half in the shadows.\\n\\n“Professor,” he said, “listen carefully. This piece of history\\nconcerns you in one definite respect, because it will answer a\\nquestion you’ve no doubt been unable to resolve.”\\n\\n“I’m listening, captain,” I said, not knowing what my partner in this\\ndialogue was driving at, and wondering if this incident related to our\\nescape plans.\\n\\n“Professor,” Captain Nemo went on, “if you’re amenable, we’ll go back\\nin time to 1702. You’re aware of the fact that in those days your King\\nLouis XIV thought an imperial gesture would suffice to humble the\\nPyrenees in the dust, so he inflicted his grandson, the Duke of Anjou,\\non the Spaniards. Reigning more or less poorly under the name King\\nPhilip V, this aristocrat had to deal with mighty opponents abroad.\\n\\n“In essence, the year before, the royal houses of Holland, Austria,\\nand England had signed a treaty of alliance at The Hague, aiming to\\nwrest the Spanish crown from King Philip V and to place it on the head\\nof an archduke whom they prematurely dubbed King Charles III.\\n\\n“Spain had to withstand these allies. But the country had practically\\nno army or navy. Yet it wasn’t short of money, provided that its\\ngalleons, laden with gold and silver from America, could enter its\\nports. Now then, late in 1702 Spain was expecting a rich convoy, which\\nFrance ventured to escort with a fleet of twenty-three vessels under\\nthe command of Admiral de Chateau-Renault, because by that time the\\nallied navies were roving the Atlantic.\\n\\n“This convoy was supposed to put into Cadiz, but after learning that\\nthe English fleet lay across those waterways, the admiral decided to\\nmake for a French port.\\n\\n“The Spanish commanders in the convoy objected to this decision. They\\nwanted to be taken to a Spanish port, if not to Cadiz, then to the Bay\\nof Vigo, located on Spain’s northwest coast and not blockaded.\\n\\n“Admiral de Chateau-Renault was so indecisive as to obey this\\ndirective, and the galleons entered the Bay of Vigo.\\n\\n“Unfortunately this bay forms an open, offshore mooring that’s\\nimpossible to defend. So it was essential to hurry and empty the\\ngalleons before the allied fleets arrived, and there would have been\\nample time for this unloading, if a wretched question of trade\\nagreements hadn’t suddenly come up.\\n\\n“Are you clear on the chain of events?” Captain Nemo asked me.\\n\\n“Perfectly clear,” I said, not yet knowing why I was being given this\\nhistory lesson.\\n\\n“Then I’ll continue. Here’s what came to pass. The tradesmen of Cadiz\\nhad negotiated a charter whereby they were to receive all merchandise\\ncoming from the West Indies. Now then, unloading the ingots from those\\ngalleons at the port of Vigo would have been a violation of their\\nrights. So they lodged a complaint in Madrid, and they obtained an\\norder from the indecisive King Philip V: without unloading, the convoy\\nwould stay in custody at the offshore mooring of Vigo until the enemy\\nfleets had retreated.\\n\\n“Now then, just as this decision was being handed down, English\\nvessels arrived in the Bay of Vigo on October 22, 1702. Despite his\\ninferior forces, Admiral de Chateau-Renault fought courageously. But\\nwhen he saw that the convoy’s wealth was about to fall into enemy\\nhands, he burned and scuttled the galleons, which went to the bottom\\nwith their immense treasures.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stopped. I admit it: I still couldn’t see how this piece\\nof history concerned me.\\n\\n“Well?” I asked him.\\n\\n“Well, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo answered me, “we’re actually\\nin that Bay of Vigo, and all that’s left is for you to probe the\\nmysteries of the place.”\\n\\nThe captain stood up and invited me to follow him. I’d had time to\\ncollect myself. I did so. The lounge was dark, but the sea’s waves\\nsparkled through the transparent windows. I stared.\\n\\nAround the Nautilus for a half-mile radius, the waters seemed\\nsaturated with electric light. The sandy bottom was clear and\\nbright. Dressed in diving suits, crewmen were busy clearing away\\nhalf-rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy\\nhulks of ships. Out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold\\nand silver, cascades of jewels, pieces of eight. The sand was heaped\\nwith them. Then, laden with these valuable spoils, the men returned to\\nthe Nautilus, dropped off their burdens inside, and went to resume\\nthis inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold.\\n\\nI understood. This was the setting of that battle on October 22,\\n1702. Here, in this very place, those galleons carrying treasure to\\nthe Spanish government had gone to the bottom. Here, whenever he\\nneeded, Captain Nemo came to withdraw these millions to ballast his\\nNautilus. It was for him, for him alone, that America had yielded up\\nits precious metals. He was the direct, sole heir to these treasures\\nwrested from the Incas and those peoples conquered by Hernando Cortez!\\n\\n“Did you know, professor,” he asked me with a smile, “that the sea\\ncontained such wealth?”\\n\\n“I know it’s estimated,” I replied, “that there are 2,000,000 metric\\ntons of silver held in suspension in seawater.”\\n\\n“Surely, but in extracting that silver, your expenses would outweigh\\nyour profits. Here, by contrast, I have only to pick up what other men\\nhave lost, and not only in this Bay of Vigo but at a thousand other\\nsites where ships have gone down, whose positions are marked on my\\nunderwater chart. Do you understand now that I’m rich to the tune of\\nbillions?”\\n\\n“I understand, captain. Nevertheless, allow me to inform you that by\\nharvesting this very Bay of Vigo, you’re simply forestalling the\\nefforts of a rival organization.”\\n\\n“What organization?”\\n\\n“A company chartered by the Spanish government to search for these\\nsunken galleons. The company’s investors were lured by the bait of\\nenormous gains, because this scuttled treasure is estimated to be\\nworth 500,000,000 francs.”\\n\\n“It was 500,000,000 francs,” Captain Nemo replied, “but no more!”\\n\\n“Right,” I said. “Hence a timely warning to those investors would be\\nan act of charity. Yet who knows if it would be well received? Usually\\nwhat gamblers regret the most isn’t the loss of their money so much as\\nthe loss of their insane hopes. But ultimately I feel less sorry for\\nthem than for the thousands of unfortunate people who would have\\nbenefited from a fair distribution of this wealth, whereas now it will\\nbe of no help to them!”\\n\\nNo sooner had I voiced this regret than I felt it must have wounded\\nCaptain Nemo.\\n\\n“No help!” he replied with growing animation. “Sir, what makes you\\nassume this wealth goes to waste when I’m the one amassing it? Do you\\nthink I toil to gather this treasure out of selfishness? Who says I\\ndon’t put it to good use? Do you think I’m unaware of the suffering\\nbeings and oppressed races living on this earth, poor people to\\ncomfort, victims to avenge? Don’t you understand . . . ?”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stopped on these last words, perhaps sorry that he had\\nsaid too much. But I had guessed. Whatever motives had driven him to\\nseek independence under the seas, he remained a human being before all\\nelse! His heart still throbbed for suffering humanity, and his immense\\nphilanthropy went out both to downtrodden races and to individuals!\\n\\nAnd now I knew where Captain Nemo had delivered those millions, when\\nthe Nautilus navigated the waters where Crete was in rebellion against\\nthe Ottoman Empire!\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\nA Lost Continent\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT MORNING, February 19, I beheld the Canadian entering my\\nstateroom. I was expecting this visit. He wore an expression of great\\ndisappointment.\\n\\n“Well, sir?” he said to me.\\n\\n“Well, Ned, the fates were against us yesterday.”\\n\\n“Yes! That damned captain had to call a halt just as we were going to\\nescape from his boat.”\\n\\n“Yes, Ned, he had business with his bankers.”\\n\\n“His bankers?”\\n\\n“Or rather his bank vaults. By which I mean this ocean, where his\\nwealth is safer than in any national treasury.”\\n\\nI then related the evening’s incidents to the Canadian, secretly\\nhoping he would come around to the idea of not deserting the captain;\\nbut my narrative had no result other than Ned’s voicing deep regret\\nthat he hadn’t strolled across the Vigo battlefield on his own behalf.\\n\\n“Anyhow,” he said, “it’s not over yet! My first harpoon missed, that’s\\nall! We’ll succeed the next time, and as soon as this evening, if need\\nbe . . .”\\n\\n“What’s the Nautilus’s heading?” I asked.\\n\\n“I’ve no idea,” Ned replied.\\n\\n“All right, at noon we’ll find out what our position is!”\\n\\nThe Canadian returned to Conseil’s side. As soon as I was dressed, I\\nwent into the lounge. The compass wasn’t encouraging. The Nautilus’s\\ncourse was south-southwest. We were turning our backs on Europe.\\n\\nI could hardly wait until our position was reported on the chart. Near\\n11:30 the ballast tanks emptied, and the submersible rose to the\\nsurface of the ocean. I leaped onto the platform. Ned Land was already\\nthere.\\n\\nNo more shore in sight. Nothing but the immenseness of the sea. A few\\nsails were on the horizon, no doubt ships going as far as Cape São\\nRoque to find favorable winds for doubling the Cape of Good Hope. The\\nsky was overcast. A squall was on the way.\\n\\nFurious, Ned tried to see through the mists on the horizon. He still\\nhoped that behind all that fog there lay those shores he longed for.\\n\\nAt noon the sun made a momentary appearance. Taking advantage of this\\nrift in the clouds, the chief officer took the orb’s altitude. Then\\nthe sea grew turbulent, we went below again, and the hatch closed once\\nmore.\\n\\nWhen I consulted the chart an hour later, I saw that the Nautilus’s\\nposition was marked at longitude 16 degrees 17’ and latitude 33\\ndegrees 22’, a good 150 leagues from the nearest coast. It wouldn’t do\\nto even dream of escaping, and I’ll let the reader decide how promptly\\nthe Canadian threw a tantrum when I ventured to tell him our\\nsituation.\\n\\nAs for me, I wasn’t exactly grief-stricken. I felt as if a heavy\\nweight had been lifted from me, and I was able to resume my regular\\ntasks in a state of comparative calm.\\n\\nNear eleven o’clock in the evening, I received a most unexpected visit\\nfrom Captain Nemo. He asked me very graciously if I felt exhausted\\nfrom our vigil the night before. I said no.\\n\\n“Then, Professor Aronnax, I propose an unusual excursion.”\\n\\n“Propose away, captain.”\\n\\n“So far you’ve visited the ocean depths only by day and under\\nsunlight. Would you like to see these depths on a dark night?”\\n\\n“Very much.”\\n\\n“I warn you, this will be an exhausting stroll. We’ll need to walk\\nlong hours and scale a mountain. The roads aren’t terribly well kept\\nup.”\\n\\n“Everything you say, captain, just increases my curiosity. I’m ready\\nto go with you.”\\n\\n“Then come along, professor, and we’ll go put on our diving suits.”\\n\\nArriving at the wardrobe, I saw that neither my companions nor any\\ncrewmen would be coming with us on this excursion. Captain Nemo hadn’t\\neven suggested my fetching Ned or Conseil.\\n\\nIn a few moments we had put on our equipment. Air tanks, abundantly\\ncharged, were placed on our backs, but the electric lamps were not in\\nreadiness. I commented on this to the captain.\\n\\n“They’ll be useless to us,” he replied.\\n\\nI thought I hadn’t heard him right, but I couldn’t repeat my comment\\nbecause the captain’s head had already disappeared into its metal\\ncovering. I finished harnessing myself, I felt an alpenstock being\\nplaced in my hand, and a few minutes later, after the usual\\nprocedures, we set foot on the floor of the Atlantic, 300 meters down.\\n\\nMidnight was approaching. The waters were profoundly dark, but Captain\\nNemo pointed to a reddish spot in the distance, a sort of wide glow\\nshimmering about two miles from the Nautilus. What this fire was, what\\nsubstances fed it, how and why it kept burning in the liquid mass, I\\ncouldn’t say. Anyhow it lit our way, although hazily, but I soon grew\\naccustomed to this unique gloom, and in these circumstances I\\nunderstood the uselessness of the Ruhmkorff device.\\n\\nSide by side, Captain Nemo and I walked directly toward this\\nconspicuous flame. The level seafloor rose imperceptibly. We took long\\nstrides, helped by our alpenstocks; but in general our progress was\\nslow, because our feet kept sinking into a kind of slimy mud mixed\\nwith seaweed and assorted flat stones.\\n\\nAs we moved forward, I heard a kind of pitter-patter above my\\nhead. Sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous\\ncrackle. I soon realized the cause. It was a heavy rainfall rattling\\non the surface of the waves. Instinctively I worried that I might get\\nsoaked! By water in the midst of water! I couldn’t help smiling at\\nthis outlandish notion. But to tell the truth, wearing these heavy\\ndiving suits, you no longer feel the liquid element, you simply think\\nyou’re in the midst of air a little denser than air on land, that’s\\nall.\\n\\nAfter half an hour of walking, the seafloor grew rocky. Jellyfish,\\nmicroscopic crustaceans, and sea-pen coral lit it faintly with their\\nphosphorescent glimmers. I glimpsed piles of stones covered by a\\ncouple million zoophytes and tangles of algae. My feet often slipped\\non this viscous seaweed carpet, and without my alpenstock I would have\\nfallen more than once. When I turned around, I could still see the\\nNautilus’s whitish beacon, which was starting to grow pale in the\\ndistance.\\n\\nThose piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor\\nwith a distinct but inexplicable symmetry. I spotted gigantic furrows\\ntrailing off into the distant darkness, their length\\nincalculable. There also were other peculiarities I couldn’t make\\nsense of. It seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a\\nlitter of bones that made a dry crackling noise. So what were these\\nvast plains we were now crossing? I wanted to ask the captain, but I\\nstill didn’t grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with\\nhis companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions.\\n\\nMeanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the\\nhorizon. The presence of this furnace under the waters had me\\nextremely puzzled. Was it some sort of electrical discharge? Was I\\napproaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on\\nshore? Or, rather (and this thought did cross my mind), had the hand\\nof man intervened in that blaze? Had human beings fanned those flames?\\nIn these deep strata would I meet up with more of Captain Nemo’s\\ncompanions, friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as\\nhis own? Would I find a whole colony of exiles down here, men tired of\\nthe world’s woes, men who had sought and found independence in the\\nocean’s lower depths? All these insane, inadmissible ideas dogged me,\\nand in this frame of mind, continually excited by the series of\\nwonders passing before my eyes, I wouldn’t have been surprised to find\\non this sea bottom one of those underwater towns Captain Nemo dreamed\\nabout!\\n\\nOur path was getting brighter and brighter. The red glow had turned\\nwhite and was radiating from a mountain peak about 800 feet high. But\\nwhat I saw was simply a reflection produced by the crystal waters of\\nthese strata. The furnace that was the source of this inexplicable\\nlight occupied the far side of the mountain.\\n\\nIn the midst of the stone mazes furrowing this Atlantic seafloor,\\nCaptain Nemo moved forward without hesitation. He knew this dark\\npath. No doubt he had often traveled it and was incapable of losing\\nhis way. I followed him with unshakeable confidence. He seemed like\\nsome Spirit of the Sea, and as he walked ahead of me, I marveled at\\nhis tall figure, which stood out in black against the glowing\\nbackground of the horizon.\\n\\nIt was one o’clock in the morning. We arrived at the mountain’s lower\\ngradients. But in grappling with them, we had to venture up difficult\\ntrails through a huge thicket.\\n\\nYes, a thicket of dead trees! Trees without leaves, without sap,\\nturned to stone by the action of the waters, and crowned here and\\nthere by gigantic pines. It was like a still-erect coalfield, its\\nroots clutching broken soil, its boughs clearly outlined against the\\nceiling of the waters like thin, black, paper cutouts. Picture a\\nforest clinging to the sides of a peak in the Harz Mountains, but a\\nsubmerged forest. The trails were cluttered with algae and fucus\\nplants, hosts of crustaceans swarming among them. I plunged on,\\nscaling rocks, straddling fallen tree trunks, snapping marine creepers\\nthat swayed from one tree to another, startling the fish that flitted\\nfrom branch to branch. Carried away, I didn’t feel exhausted any\\nmore. I followed a guide who was immune to exhaustion.\\n\\nWhat a sight! How can I describe it! How can I portray these woods and\\nrocks in this liquid setting, their lower parts dark and sullen, their\\nupper parts tinted red in this light whose intensity was doubled by\\nthe reflecting power of the waters! We scaled rocks that crumbled\\nbehind us, collapsing in enormous sections with the hollow rumble of\\nan avalanche. To our right and left there were carved gloomy galleries\\nwhere the eye lost its way. Huge glades opened up, seemingly cleared\\nby the hand of man, and I sometimes wondered whether some residents of\\nthese underwater regions would suddenly appear before me.\\n\\nBut Captain Nemo kept climbing. I didn’t want to fall behind. I\\nfollowed him boldly. My alpenstock was a great help. One wrong step\\nwould have been disastrous on the narrow paths cut into the sides of\\nthese chasms, but I walked along with a firm tread and without the\\nslightest feeling of dizziness. Sometimes I leaped over a crevasse\\nwhose depth would have made me recoil had I been in the midst of\\nglaciers on shore; sometimes I ventured out on a wobbling tree trunk\\nfallen across a gorge, without looking down, having eyes only for\\nmarveling at the wild scenery of this region. There, leaning on\\nerratically cut foundations, monumental rocks seemed to defy the laws\\nof balance. From between their stony knees, trees sprang up like jets\\nunder fearsome pressure, supporting other trees that supported them in\\nturn. Next, natural towers with wide, steeply carved battlements\\nleaned at angles that, on dry land, the laws of gravity would never\\nhave authorized.\\n\\nAnd I too could feel the difference created by the water’s powerful\\ndensity—despite my heavy clothing, copper headpiece, and metal soles,\\nI climbed the most impossibly steep gradients with all the nimbleness,\\nI swear it, of a chamois or a Pyrenees mountain goat!\\n\\nAs for my account of this excursion under the waters, I’m well aware\\nthat it sounds incredible! I’m the chronicler of deeds seemingly\\nimpossible and yet incontestably real. This was no fantasy. This was\\nwhat I saw and felt!\\n\\nTwo hours after leaving the Nautilus, we had cleared the timberline,\\nand 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak, forming a dark\\nsilhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far\\nslope. Petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling\\nzigzags. Fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall\\ngrass. The rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices, deep\\ncaves, unfathomable holes at whose far ends I could hear fearsome\\nthings moving around. My blood would curdle as I watched some enormous\\nantenna bar my path, or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the\\nshadow of some cavity! A thousand specks of light glittered in the\\nmidst of the gloom. They were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans\\ncrouching in their lairs, giant lobsters rearing up like spear\\ncarriers and moving their claws with a scrap-iron clanking, titanic\\ncrabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages, and hideous\\ndevilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes.\\n\\nWhat was this astounding world that I didn’t yet know? In what order\\ndid these articulates belong, these creatures for which the rocks\\nprovided a second carapace? Where had nature learned the secret of\\ntheir vegetating existence, and for how many centuries had they lived\\nin the ocean’s lower strata?\\n\\nBut I couldn’t linger. Captain Nemo, on familiar terms with these\\ndreadful animals, no longer minded them. We arrived at a preliminary\\nplateau where still other surprises were waiting for me. There\\npicturesque ruins took shape, betraying the hand of man, not our\\nCreator. They were huge stacks of stones in which you could\\ndistinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples, now arrayed\\nin hosts of blossoming zoophytes, and over it all, not ivy but a heavy\\nmantle of algae and fucus plants.\\n\\nBut what part of the globe could this be, this land swallowed by\\ncataclysms? Who had set up these rocks and stones like the dolmens of\\nprehistoric times? Where was I, where had Captain Nemo’s fancies taken\\nme?\\n\\nI wanted to ask him. Unable to, I stopped him. I seized his arm. But\\nhe shook his head, pointed to the mountain’s topmost peak, and seemed\\nto tell me:\\n\\n“Come on! Come with me! Come higher!”\\n\\nI followed him with one last burst of energy, and in a few minutes I\\nhad scaled the peak, which crowned the whole rocky mass by some ten\\nmeters.\\n\\nI looked back down the side we had just cleared. There the mountain\\nrose only 700 to 800 feet above the plains; but on its far slope it\\ncrowned the receding bottom of this part of the Atlantic by a height\\ntwice that. My eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit\\nby intense flashes of light. In essence, this mountain was a\\nvolcano. Fifty feet below its peak, amid a shower of stones and slag,\\na wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in fiery\\ncascades into the heart of the liquid mass. So situated, this volcano\\nwas an immense torch that lit up the lower plains all the way to the\\nhorizon.\\n\\nAs I said, this underwater crater spewed lava, but not flames. Flames\\nneed oxygen from the air and are unable to spread underwater; but a\\nlava flow, which contains in itself the principle of its\\nincandescence, can rise to a white heat, overpower the liquid element,\\nand turn it into steam on contact. Swift currents swept away all this\\ndiffuse gas, and torrents of lava slid to the foot of the mountain,\\nlike the disgorgings of a Mt. Vesuvius over the city limits of a\\nsecond Torre del Greco.\\n\\nIn fact, there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins, demolished,\\noverwhelmed, laid low, its roofs caved in, its temples pulled down,\\nits arches dislocated, its columns stretching over the earth; in these\\nruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of Tuscan\\narchitecture; farther off, the remains of a gigantic aqueduct; here,\\nthe caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a\\nParthenon; there, the remnants of a wharf, as if some bygone port had\\nlong ago harbored merchant vessels and triple-tiered war galleys on\\nthe shores of some lost ocean; still farther off, long rows of\\ncollapsing walls, deserted thoroughfares, a whole Pompeii buried under\\nthe waters, which Captain Nemo had resurrected before my eyes!\\n\\nWhere was I? Where was I? I had to find out at all cost, I wanted to\\nspeak, I wanted to rip off the copper sphere imprisoning my head.\\n\\nBut Captain Nemo came over and stopped me with a gesture. Then,\\npicking up a piece of chalky stone, he advanced to a black basaltic\\nrock and scrawled this one word:\\n\\nATLANTIS\\n\\nWhat lightning flashed through my mind! Atlantis, that ancient land of\\nMeropis mentioned by the historian Theopompus; Plato’s Atlantis; the\\ncontinent whose very existence has been denied by such philosophers\\nand scientists as Origen, Porphyry, Iamblichus, d’Anville, Malte-Brun,\\nand Humboldt, who entered its disappearance in the ledger of myths and\\nfolk tales; the country whose reality has nevertheless been accepted\\nby such other thinkers as Posidonius, Pliny, Ammianus Marcellinus,\\nTertullian, Engel, Scherer, Tournefort, Buffon, and d’Avezac; I had\\nthis land right under my eyes, furnishing its own unimpeachable\\nevidence of the catastrophe that had overtaken it! So this was the\\nsubmerged region that had existed outside Europe, Asia, and Libya,\\nbeyond the Pillars of Hercules, home of those powerful Atlantean\\npeople against whom ancient Greece had waged its earliest wars!\\n\\nThe writer whose narratives record the lofty deeds of those heroic\\ntimes is Plato himself. His dialogues Timaeus and Critias were drafted\\nwith the poet and legislator Solon as their inspiration, as it were.\\n\\nOne day Solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the\\nEgyptian capital of Sais, a town already 8,000 years of age, as\\ndocumented by the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its\\ntemples. One of these elders related the history of another town 1,000\\nyears older still. This original city of Athens, ninety centuries old,\\nhad been invaded and partly destroyed by the Atlanteans. These\\nAtlanteans, he said, resided on an immense continent greater than\\nAfrica and\\n\\nAsia combined, taking in an area that lay between latitude 12 degrees\\nand 40 degrees north. Their dominion extended even to Egypt. They\\ntried to enforce their rule as far as Greece, but they had to retreat\\nbefore the indomitable resistance of the Hellenic people. Centuries\\npassed. A cataclysm occurred—floods, earthquakes. A single night and\\nday were enough to obliterate this Atlantis, whose highest peaks\\n(Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries, the Cape Verde Islands) still\\nemerge above the waves.\\n\\nThese were the historical memories that Captain Nemo’s scrawl sent\\nrushing through my mind. Thus, led by the strangest of fates, I was\\ntreading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent! My hands\\nwere touching ruins many thousands of years old, contemporary with\\nprehistoric times! I was walking in the very place where\\ncontemporaries of early man had walked! My heavy soles were crushing\\nthe skeletons of animals from the age of fable, animals that used to\\ntake cover in the shade of these trees now turned to stone!\\n\\nOh, why was I so short of time! I would have gone down the steep\\nslopes of this mountain, crossed this entire immense continent, which\\nsurely connects Africa with America, and visited its great prehistoric\\ncities. Under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of Makhimos\\nor the pious village of Eusebes, whose gigantic inhabitants lived for\\nwhole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that\\nstill withstood the action of the waters. One day perhaps, some\\nvolcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface\\nof the waves! Numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this\\npart of the ocean, and many ships have felt terrific tremors when\\npassing over these turbulent depths. A few have heard hollow noises\\nthat announced some struggle of the elements far below, others have\\nhauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves. As far as the equator\\nthis whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic\\nforces. And in some remote epoch, built up by volcanic disgorgings and\\nsuccessive layers of lava, who knows whether the peaks of these\\nfire-belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the\\nAtlantic!\\n\\nAs I mused in this way, trying to establish in my memory every detail\\nof this impressive landscape, Captain Nemo was leaning his elbows on a\\nmoss-covered monument, motionless as if petrified in some mute\\ntrance. Was he dreaming of those lost generations, asking them for the\\nsecret of human destiny? Was it here that this strange man came to\\nrevive himself, basking in historical memories, reliving that bygone\\nlife, he who had no desire for our modern one? I would have given\\nanything to know his thoughts, to share them, understand them!\\n\\nWe stayed in this place an entire hour, contemplating its vast plains\\nin the lava’s glow, which sometimes took on a startling\\nintensity. Inner boilings sent quick shivers running through the\\nmountain’s crust. Noises from deep underneath, clearly transmitted by\\nthe liquid medium, reverberated with majestic amplitude.\\n\\nJust then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass,\\ncasting a few pale rays over this submerged continent. It was only a\\nfleeting glimmer, but its effect was indescribable. The captain stood\\nup and took one last look at these immense plains; then his hand\\nsignaled me to follow him.\\n\\nWe went swiftly down the mountain. Once past the petrified forest, I\\ncould see the Nautilus’s beacon twinkling like a star. The captain\\nwalked straight toward it, and we were back on board just as the first\\nglimmers of dawn were whitening the surface of the ocean.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\nThe Underwater Coalfields\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY, February 20, I overslept. I was so exhausted from the\\nnight before, I didn’t get up until eleven o’clock. I dressed\\nquickly. I hurried to find out the Nautilus’s heading. The instruments\\nindicated that it was running southward at a speed of twenty miles per\\nhour and a depth of 100 meters.\\n\\nConseil entered. I described our nocturnal excursion to him, and since\\nthe panels were open, he could still catch a glimpse of this submerged\\ncontinent.\\n\\nIn fact, the Nautilus was skimming only ten meters over the soil of\\nthese Atlantis plains. The ship scudded along like an air balloon\\nborne by the wind over some prairie on land; but it would be more\\naccurate to say that we sat in the lounge as if we were riding in a\\ncoach on an express train. As for the foregrounds passing before our\\neyes, they were fantastically carved rocks, forests of trees that had\\ncrossed over from the vegetable kingdom into the mineral kingdom,\\ntheir motionless silhouettes sprawling beneath the waves. There also\\nwere stony masses buried beneath carpets of axidia and sea anemone,\\nbristling with long, vertical water plants, then strangely contoured\\nblocks of lava that testified to all the fury of those plutonic\\ndevelopments.\\n\\nWhile this bizarre scenery was glittering under our electric beams, I\\ntold Conseil the story of the Atlanteans, who had inspired the old\\nFrench scientist Jean Bailly to write so many entertaining—albeit\\nutterly fictitious—pages.* I told the lad about the wars of these\\nheroic people. I discussed the question of Atlantis with the fervor of\\na man who no longer had any doubts. But Conseil was so distracted he\\nbarely heard me, and his lack of interest in any commentary on this\\nhistorical topic was soon explained.\\n\\n*Bailly believed that Atlantis was located at the North Pole! Ed.\\n\\nIn essence, numerous fish had caught his eye, and when fish pass by,\\nConseil vanishes into his world of classifying and leaves real life\\nbehind. In which case I could only tag along and resume our\\nichthyological research.\\n\\nEven so, these Atlantic fish were not noticeably different from those\\nwe had observed earlier. There were rays of gigantic size, five meters\\nlong and with muscles so powerful they could leap above the waves,\\nsharks of various species including a fifteen-foot glaucous shark with\\nsharp triangular teeth and so transparent it was almost invisible amid\\nthe waters, brown lantern sharks, prism-shaped humantin sharks armored\\nwith protuberant hides, sturgeons resembling their relatives in the\\nMediterranean, trumpet-snouted pipefish a foot and a half long,\\nyellowish brown with small gray fins and no teeth or tongue, unreeling\\nlike slim, supple snakes.\\n\\nAmong bony fish, Conseil noticed some blackish marlin three meters\\nlong with a sharp sword jutting from the upper jaw, bright-colored\\nweevers known in Aristotle’s day as sea dragons and whose dorsal\\nstingers make them quite dangerous to pick up, then dolphinfish with\\nbrown backs striped in blue and edged in gold, handsome dorados,\\nmoonlike opahs that look like azure disks but which the sun’s rays\\nturn into spots of silver, finally eight-meter swordfish from the\\ngenus Xiphias, swimming in schools, sporting yellowish sickle-shaped\\nfins and six-foot broadswords, stalwart animals, plant eaters rather\\nthan fish eaters, obeying the tiniest signals from their females like\\nhenpecked husbands.\\n\\nBut while observing these different specimens of marine fauna, I\\ndidn’t stop examining the long plains of Atlantis. Sometimes an\\nunpredictable irregularity in the seafloor would force the Nautilus to\\nslow down, and then it would glide into the narrow channels between\\nthe hills with a cetacean’s dexterity. If the labyrinth became\\nhopelessly tangled, the submersible would rise above it like an\\nairship, and after clearing the obstacle, it would resume its speedy\\ncourse just a few meters above the ocean floor. It was an enjoyable\\nand impressive way of navigating that did indeed recall the maneuvers\\nof an airship ride, with the major difference that the Nautilus\\nfaithfully obeyed the hands of its helmsman.\\n\\nThe terrain consisted mostly of thick slime mixed with petrified\\nbranches, but it changed little by little near four o’clock in the\\nafternoon; it grew rockier and seemed to be strewn with pudding stones\\nand a basaltic gravel called “tuff,” together with bits of lava and\\nsulfurous obsidian. I expected these long plains to change into\\nmountain regions, and in fact, as the Nautilus was executing certain\\nturns, I noticed that the southerly horizon was blocked by a high wall\\nthat seemed to close off every exit. Its summit obviously poked above\\nthe level of the ocean. It had to be a continent or at least an\\nisland, either one of the Canaries or one of the Cape Verde\\nIslands. Our bearings hadn’t been marked on the chart—perhaps\\ndeliberately—and I had no idea what our position was. In any case this\\nwall seemed to signal the end of Atlantis, of which, all in all, we\\nhad crossed only a small part.\\n\\nNightfall didn’t interrupt my observations. I was left to\\nmyself. Conseil had repaired to his cabin. The Nautilus slowed down,\\nhovering above the muddled masses on the seafloor, sometimes grazing\\nthem as if wanting to come to rest, sometimes rising unpredictably to\\nthe surface of the waves. Then I glimpsed a few bright constellations\\nthrough the crystal waters, specifically five or six of those zodiacal\\nstars trailing from the tail end of Orion.\\n\\nI would have stayed longer at my window, marveling at these beauties\\nof sea and sky, but the panels closed. Just then the Nautilus had\\narrived at the perpendicular face of that high wall. How the ship\\nwould maneuver I hadn’t a guess. I repaired to my stateroom. The\\nNautilus did not stir. I fell asleep with the firm intention of waking\\nup in just a few hours.\\n\\nBut it was eight o’clock the next day when I returned to the lounge. I\\nstared at the pressure gauge. It told me that the Nautilus was afloat\\non the surface of the ocean. Furthermore, I heard the sound of\\nfootsteps on the platform. Yet there were no rolling movements to\\nindicate the presence of waves undulating above me.\\n\\nI climbed as far as the hatch. It was open. But instead of the broad\\ndaylight I was expecting, I found that I was surrounded by total\\ndarkness. Where were we? Had I been mistaken? Was it still night? No!\\nNot one star was twinkling, and nighttime is never so utterly black.\\n\\nI wasn’t sure what to think, when a voice said to me:\\n\\n“Is that you, professor?”\\n\\n“Ah, Captain Nemo!” I replied. “Where are we?”\\n\\n“Underground, professor.”\\n\\n“Underground!” I exclaimed. “And the Nautilus is still floating?”\\n\\n“It always floats.”\\n\\n“But I don’t understand!”\\n\\n“Wait a little while. Our beacon is about to go on, and if you want\\nsome light on the subject, you’ll be satisfied.”\\n\\nI set foot on the platform and waited. The darkness was so profound I\\ncouldn’t see even Captain Nemo. However, looking at the zenith\\ndirectly overhead, I thought I caught sight of a feeble glimmer, a\\nsort of twilight filtering through a circular hole. Just then the\\nbeacon suddenly went on, and its intense brightness made that hazy\\nlight vanish.\\n\\nThis stream of electricity dazzled my eyes, and after momentarily\\nshutting them, I looked around. The Nautilus was stationary. It was\\nfloating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf. As for the water\\nnow buoying the ship, it was a lake completely encircled by an inner\\nwall about two miles in diameter, hence six miles around. Its level—as\\nindicated by the pressure gauge—would be the same as the outside\\nlevel, because some connection had to exist between this lake and the\\nsea. Slanting inward over their base, these high walls converged to\\nform a vault shaped like an immense upside-down funnel that measured\\n500 or 600 meters in height. At its summit there gaped the circular\\nopening through which I had detected that faint glimmer, obviously\\ndaylight.\\n\\nBefore more carefully examining the interior features of this enormous\\ncavern, and before deciding if it was the work of nature or humankind,\\nI went over to Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“Where are we?” I said.\\n\\n“In the very heart of an extinct volcano,” the captain answered me, “a\\nvolcano whose interior was invaded by the sea after some convulsion in\\nthe earth. While you were sleeping, professor, the Nautilus entered\\nthis lagoon through a natural channel that opens ten meters below the\\nsurface of the ocean. This is our home port, secure, convenient,\\nsecret, and sheltered against winds from any direction! Along the\\ncoasts of your continents or islands, show me any offshore mooring\\nthat can equal this safe refuge for withstanding the fury of\\nhurricanes.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” I replied, “here you’re in perfect safety, Captain Nemo. Who\\ncould reach you in the heart of a volcano? But don’t I see an opening\\nat its summit?”\\n\\n“Yes, its crater, a crater formerly filled with lava, steam, and\\nflames, but which now lets in this life-giving air we’re breathing.”\\n\\n“But which volcanic mountain is this?” I asked.\\n\\n“It’s one of the many islets with which this sea is strewn. For ships\\na mere reef, for us an immense cavern. I discovered it by chance, and\\nchance served me well.”\\n\\n“But couldn’t someone enter through the mouth of its crater?”\\n\\n“No more than I could exit through it. You can climb about 100 feet up\\nthe inner base of this mountain, but then the walls overhang, they\\nlean too far in to be scaled.”\\n\\n“I can see, captain, that nature is your obedient servant, any time or\\nany place. You’re safe on this lake, and nobody else can visit its\\nwaters. But what’s the purpose of this refuge? The Nautilus doesn’t\\nneed a harbor.”\\n\\n“No, professor, but it needs electricity to run, batteries to generate\\nits electricity, sodium to feed its batteries, coal to make its\\nsodium, and coalfields from which to dig its coal. Now then, right at\\nthis spot the sea covers entire forests that sank underwater in\\nprehistoric times; today, turned to stone, transformed into carbon\\nfuel, they offer me inexhaustible coal mines.”\\n\\n“So, captain, your men practice the trade of miners here?”\\n\\n“Precisely. These mines extend under the waves like the coalfields at\\nNewcastle. Here, dressed in diving suits, pick and mattock in hand, my\\nmen go out and dig this carbon fuel for which I don’t need a single\\nmine on land. When I burn this combustible to produce sodium, the\\nsmoke escaping from the mountain’s crater gives it the appearance of a\\nstill-active volcano.”\\n\\n“And will we see your companions at work?”\\n\\n“No, at least not this time, because I’m eager to continue our\\nunderwater tour of the world. Accordingly, I’ll rest content with\\ndrawing on my reserve stock of sodium. We’ll stay here long enough to\\nload it on board, in other words, a single workday, then we’ll resume\\nour voyage. So, Professor Aronnax, if you’d like to explore this\\ncavern and circle its lagoon, seize the day.”\\n\\nI thanked the captain and went to look for my two companions, who\\nhadn’t yet left their cabin. I invited them to follow me, not telling\\nthem where we were.\\n\\nThey climbed onto the platform. Conseil, whom nothing could startle,\\nsaw it as a perfectly natural thing to fall asleep under the waves and\\nwake up under a mountain. But Ned Land had no idea in his head other\\nthan to see if this cavern offered some way out.\\n\\nAfter breakfast near ten o’clock, we went down onto the embankment.\\n\\n“So here we are, back on shore,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“I’d hardly call this shore,” the Canadian replied. “And besides, we\\naren’t on it but under it.”\\n\\nA sandy beach unfolded before us, measuring 500 feet at its widest\\npoint between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain’s\\nwalls. Via this strand you could easily circle the lake. But the base\\nof these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay\\npicturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones. All\\nthese crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the\\naction of underground fires, and they glistened under the stream of\\nelectric light from our beacon. Stirred up by our footsteps, the\\nmica-rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks.\\n\\nThe ground rose appreciably as it moved away from the sand flats by\\nthe waves, and we soon arrived at some long, winding gradients,\\ngenuinely steep paths that allowed us to climb little by little; but\\nwe had to tread cautiously in the midst of pudding stones that weren’t\\ncemented together, and our feet kept skidding on glassy trachyte, made\\nof feldspar and quartz crystals.\\n\\nThe volcanic nature of this enormous pit was apparent all around us. I\\nventured to comment on it to my companions.\\n\\n“Can you picture,” I asked them, “what this funnel must have been like\\nwhen it was filled with boiling lava, and the level of that\\nincandescent liquid rose right to the mountain’s mouth, like cast iron\\nup the insides of a furnace?”\\n\\n“I can picture it perfectly,” Conseil replied. “But will master tell\\nme why this huge smelter suspended operations, and how it is that an\\noven was replaced by the tranquil waters of a lake?”\\n\\n“In all likelihood, Conseil, because some convulsion created an\\nopening below the surface of the ocean, the opening that serves as a\\npassageway for the Nautilus. Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed\\ninside the mountain. There ensued a dreadful struggle between the\\nelements of fire and water, a struggle ending in King Neptune’s\\nfavor. But many centuries have passed since then, and this submerged\\nvolcano has changed into a peaceful cavern.”\\n\\n“That’s fine,” Ned Land answered. “I accept the explanation, but in\\nour personal interests, I’m sorry this opening the professor mentions\\nwasn’t made above sea level.”\\n\\n“But Ned my friend,” Conseil answered, “if it weren’t an underwater\\npassageway, the Nautilus couldn’t enter it!”\\n\\n“And I might add, Mr. Land,” I said, “that the waters wouldn’t have\\nrushed under the mountain, and the volcano would still be a\\nvolcano. So you have nothing to be sorry about.”\\n\\nOur climb continued. The gradients got steeper and narrower. Sometimes\\nthey were cut across by deep pits that had to be cleared. Masses of\\noverhanging rock had to be gotten around. You slid on your knees, you\\ncrept on your belly. But helped by the Canadian’s strength and\\nConseil’s dexterity, we overcame every obstacle.\\n\\nAt an elevation of about thirty meters, the nature of the terrain\\nchanged without becoming any easier. Pudding stones and trachyte gave\\nway to black basaltic rock: here, lying in slabs all swollen with\\nblisters; there, shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series\\nof columns that supported the springings of this immense vault, a\\nwonderful sample of natural architecture. Then, among this basaltic\\nrock, there snaked long, hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of\\nbituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur. The\\nsunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger, shedding a hazy\\nlight over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this\\nextinct mountain.\\n\\nBut when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet, we were\\nstopped by insurmountable obstacles. The converging inside walls\\nchanged into overhangs, and our climb into a circular stroll. At this\\ntopmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral\\nkingdom. Shrubs, and even a few trees, emerged from crevices in the\\nwalls. I recognized some spurges that let their caustic, purgative sap\\ntrickle out. There were heliotropes, very remiss at living up to their\\nsun-worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them; their\\nclusters of flowers drooped sadly, their colors and scents were\\nfaded. Here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of\\naloes with long, sad, sickly leaves. But between these lava flows I\\nspotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance, and I\\nconfess that I inhaled it with delight. The soul of a flower is its\\nscent, and those splendid water plants, flowers of the sea, have no\\nsouls!\\n\\nWe had arrived at the foot of a sturdy clump of dragon trees, which\\nwere splitting the rocks with exertions of their muscular roots, when\\nNed Land exclaimed:\\n\\n“Oh, sir, a hive!”\\n\\n“A hive?” I answered, with a gesture of utter disbelief.\\n\\n“Yes, a hive,” the Canadian repeated, “with bees buzzing around!”\\n\\nI went closer and was forced to recognize the obvious. At the mouth of\\na hole cut in the trunk of a dragon tree, there swarmed thousands of\\nthese ingenious insects so common to all the Canary Islands, where\\ntheir output is especially prized.\\n\\nNaturally enough, the Canadian wanted to lay in a supply of honey, and\\nit would have been ill-mannered of me to say no. He mixed sulfur with\\nsome dry leaves, set them on fire with a spark from his tinderbox, and\\nproceeded to smoke the bees out. Little by little the buzzing died\\ndown and the disemboweled hive yielded several pounds of sweet\\nhoney. Ned Land stuffed his haversack with it.\\n\\n“When I’ve mixed this honey with our breadfruit batter,” he told us,\\n“I’ll be ready to serve you a delectable piece of cake.”\\n\\n“But of course,” Conseil put in, “it will be gingerbread!”\\n\\n“I’m all for gingerbread,” I said, “but let’s resume this fascinating\\nstroll.”\\n\\nAt certain turns in the trail we were going along, the lake appeared\\nin its full expanse. The ship’s beacon lit up that whole placid\\nsurface, which experienced neither ripples nor undulations. The\\nNautilus lay perfectly still. On its platform and on the embankment,\\ncrewmen were bustling around, black shadows that stood out clearly in\\nthe midst of the luminous air.\\n\\nJust then we went around the highest ridge of these rocky foothills\\nthat supported the vault. Then I saw that bees weren’t the animal\\nkingdom’s only representatives inside this volcano. Here and in the\\nshadows, birds of prey soared and whirled, flying away from nests\\nperched on tips of rock. There were sparrow hawks with white bellies,\\nand screeching kestrels. With all the speed their stiltlike legs could\\nmuster, fine fat bustards scampered over the slopes. I’ll let the\\nreader decide whether the Canadian’s appetite was aroused by the sight\\nof this tasty game, and whether he regretted having no rifle in his\\nhands. He tried to make stones do the work of bullets, and after\\nseveral fruitless attempts, he managed to wound one of these\\nmagnificent bustards. To say he risked his life twenty times in order\\nto capture this bird is simply the unadulterated truth; but he fared\\nso well, the animal went into his sack to join the honeycombs.\\n\\nBy then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge\\nhad become impossible. Above us, the yawning crater looked like the\\nwide mouth of a well. From where we stood, the sky was pretty easy to\\nsee, and I watched clouds race by, disheveled by the west wind,\\nletting tatters of mist trail over the mountain’s summit. Proof\\npositive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude, because this\\nvolcano didn’t rise more than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean.\\n\\nHalf an hour after the Canadian’s latest exploits, we were back on the\\ninner beach. There the local flora was represented by a wide carpet of\\nsamphire, a small umbelliferous plant that keeps quite nicely, which\\nalso boasts the names glasswort, saxifrage, and sea fennel. Conseil\\npicked a couple bunches. As for the local fauna, it included thousands\\nof crustaceans of every type: lobsters, hermit crabs, prawns, mysid\\nshrimps, daddy longlegs, rock crabs, and a prodigious number of\\nseashells, such as cowries, murex snails, and limpets.\\n\\nIn this locality there gaped the mouth of a magnificent cave. My\\ncompanions and I took great pleasure in stretching out on its\\nfine-grained sand. Fire had polished the sparkling enamel of its inner\\nwalls, sprinkled all over with mica-rich dust. Ned Land tapped these\\nwalls and tried to probe their thickness. I couldn’t help smiling. Our\\nconversation then turned to his everlasting escape plans, and without\\ngoing too far, I felt I could offer him this hope: Captain Nemo had\\ngone down south only to replenish his sodium supplies. So I hoped he\\nwould now hug the coasts of Europe and America, which would allow the\\nCanadian to try again with a greater chance of success.\\n\\nWe were stretched out in this delightful cave for an hour. Our\\nconversation, lively at the outset, then languished. A definite\\ndrowsiness overcame us. Since I saw no good reason to resist the call\\nof sleep, I fell into a heavy doze. I dreamed—one doesn’t choose his\\ndreams—that my life had been reduced to the vegetating existence of a\\nsimple mollusk. It seemed to me that this cave made up my\\ndouble-valved shell. . . .\\n\\nSuddenly Conseil’s voice startled me awake.\\n\\n“Get up! Get up!” shouted the fine lad.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked, in a sitting position.\\n\\n“The water’s coming up to us!”\\n\\nI got back on my feet. Like a torrent the sea was rushing into our\\nretreat, and since we definitely were not mollusks, we had to clear\\nout.\\n\\nIn a few seconds we were safe on top of the cave.\\n\\n“What happened?” Conseil asked. “Some new phenomenon?”\\n\\n“Not quite, my friends!” I replied. “It was the tide, merely the tide,\\nwhich wellnigh caught us by surprise just as it did Sir Walter Scott’s\\nhero! The ocean outside is rising, and by a perfectly natural law of\\nbalance, the level of this lake is also rising. We’ve gotten off with\\na mild dunking. Let’s go change clothes on the Nautilus.”\\n\\nThree-quarters of an hour later, we had completed our circular stroll\\nand were back on board. Just then the crewmen finished loading the\\nsodium supplies, and the Nautilus could have departed immediately.\\n\\nBut Captain Nemo gave no orders. Would he wait for nightfall and exit\\nthrough his underwater passageway in secrecy? Perhaps.\\n\\nBe that as it may, by the next day the Nautilus had left its home port\\nand was navigating well out from any shore, a few meters beneath the\\nwaves of the Atlantic.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\nThe Sargasso Sea\\n\\n\\nTHE NAUTILUS didn’t change direction. For the time being, then, we had\\nto set aside any hope of returning to European seas. Captain Nemo kept\\nhis prow pointing south. Where was he taking us? I was afraid to\\nguess.\\n\\nThat day the Nautilus crossed an odd part of the Atlantic Ocean. No\\none is unaware of the existence of that great warm-water current known\\nby name as the Gulf Stream. After emerging from channels off Florida,\\nit heads toward Spitzbergen. But before entering the Gulf of Mexico\\nnear latitude 44 degrees north, this current divides into two arms;\\nits chief arm makes for the shores of Ireland and Norway while the\\nsecond flexes southward at the level of the Azores; then it hits the\\ncoast of Africa, sweeps in a long oval, and returns to the Caribbean\\nSea.\\n\\nNow then, this second arm—more accurately, a collar—forms a ring of\\nwarm water around a section of cool, tranquil, motionless ocean called\\nthe Sargasso Sea. This is an actual lake in the open Atlantic, and the\\ngreat current’s waters take at least three years to circle it.\\n\\nProperly speaking, the Sargasso Sea covers every submerged part of\\nAtlantis. Certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn\\nover this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient\\ncontinent. But it’s more likely that these grasses, algae, and fucus\\nplants were carried off from the beaches of Europe and America, then\\ntaken as far as this zone by the Gulf Stream. This is one of the\\nreasons why Christopher Columbus assumed the existence of a New\\nWorld. When the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the\\nSargasso Sea, they had great difficulty navigating in the midst of\\nthese weeds, which, much to their crews’ dismay, slowed them down to a\\nhalt; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector.\\n\\nSuch was the region our Nautilus was visiting just then: a genuine\\nprairie, a tightly woven carpet of algae, gulfweed, and bladder wrack\\nso dense and compact a craft’s stempost couldn’t tear through it\\nwithout difficulty. Accordingly, not wanting to entangle his propeller\\nin this weed-choked mass, Captain Nemo stayed at a depth some meters\\nbelow the surface of the waves.\\n\\nThe name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word “sargazo,” meaning\\ngulfweed. This gulfweed, the swimming gulfweed or berry carrier, is\\nthe chief substance making up this immense shoal. And here’s why these\\nwater plants collect in this placid Atlantic basin, according to the\\nexpert on the subject, Commander Maury, author of The Physical\\nGeography of the Sea.\\n\\nThe explanation he gives seems to entail a set of conditions that\\neverybody knows: “Now,” Maury says, “if bits of cork or chaff, or any\\nfloating substance, be put into a basin, and a circular motion be\\ngiven to the water, all the light substances will be found crowding\\ntogether near the center of the pool, where there is the least\\nmotion. Just such a basin is the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf Stream,\\nand the Sargasso Sea is the center of the whirl.”\\n\\nI share Maury’s view, and I was able to study the phenomenon in this\\nexclusive setting where ships rarely go. Above us, huddled among the\\nbrown weeds, there floated objects originating from all over: tree\\ntrunks ripped from the Rocky Mountains or the Andes and sent floating\\ndown the Amazon or the Mississippi, numerous pieces of wreckage,\\nremnants of keels or undersides, bulwarks staved in and so weighed\\ndown with seashells and barnacles, they couldn’t rise to the surface\\nof the ocean. And the passing years will someday bear out Maury’s\\nother view that by collecting in this way over the centuries, these\\nsubstances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and\\nwill then form inexhaustible coalfields. Valuable reserves prepared by\\nfarseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines\\non the continents.\\n\\nIn the midst of this hopelessly tangled fabric of weeds and fucus\\nplants, I noted some delightful pink-colored, star-shaped alcyon\\ncoral, sea anemone trailing the long tresses of their tentacles, some\\ngreen, red, and blue jellyfish, and especially those big rhizostome\\njellyfish that Cuvier described, whose bluish parasols are trimmed\\nwith violet festoons.\\n\\nWe spent the whole day of February 22 in the Sargasso Sea, where fish\\nthat dote on marine plants and crustaceans find plenty to eat. The\\nnext day the ocean resumed its usual appearance.\\n\\nFrom this moment on, for nineteen days from February 23 to March 12,\\nthe Nautilus stayed in the middle of the Atlantic, hustling us along\\nat a constant speed of 100 leagues every twenty-four hours. It was\\nobvious that Captain Nemo wanted to carry out his underwater program,\\nand I had no doubt that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn, to\\nreturn to the Pacific South Seas.\\n\\nSo Ned Land had good reason to worry. In these wide seas empty of\\nislands, it was no longer feasible to jump ship. Nor did we have any\\nway to counter Captain Nemo’s whims. We had no choice but to\\nacquiesce; but if we couldn’t attain our end through force or cunning,\\nI liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion. Once this\\nvoyage was over, might not Captain Nemo consent to set us free in\\nreturn for our promise never to reveal his existence? Our word of\\nhonor, which we sincerely would have kept. However, this delicate\\nquestion would have to be negotiated with the captain. But how would\\nhe receive our demands for freedom? At the very outset and in no\\nuncertain terms, hadn’t he declared that the secret of his life\\nrequired that we be permanently imprisoned on board the Nautilus?\\nWouldn’t he see my four-month silence as a tacit acceptance of this\\nsituation? Would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that\\ncould jeopardize our escape plans, if we had promising circumstances\\nfor trying again later on? I weighed all these considerations, turned\\nthem over in my mind, submitted them to Conseil, but he was as baffled\\nas I was. In short, although I’m not easily discouraged, I realized\\nthat my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by\\nthe day, especially at a time when Captain Nemo was recklessly racing\\ntoward the south Atlantic!\\n\\nDuring those nineteen days just mentioned, no unique incidents\\ndistinguished our voyage. I saw little of the captain. He was at\\nwork. In the library I often found books he had left open, especially\\nbooks on natural history. He had thumbed through my work on the great\\nocean depths, and the margins were covered with his notes, which\\nsometimes contradicted my theories and formulations. But the captain\\nremained content with this method of refining my work, and he rarely\\ndiscussed it with me. Sometimes I heard melancholy sounds\\nreverberating from the organ, which he played very expressively, but\\nonly at night in the midst of the most secretive darkness, while the\\nNautilus slumbered in the wilderness of the ocean.\\n\\nDuring this part of our voyage, we navigated on the surface of the\\nwaves for entire days. The sea was nearly deserted. A few sailing\\nships, laden for the East Indies, were heading toward the Cape of Good\\nHope. One day we were chased by the longboats of a whaling vessel,\\nwhich undoubtedly viewed us as some enormous baleen whale of great\\nvalue. But Captain Nemo didn’t want these gallant gentlemen wasting\\ntheir time and energy, so he ended the hunt by diving beneath the\\nwaters. This incident seemed to fascinate Ned Land intensely. I’m sure\\nthe Canadian was sorry that these fishermen couldn’t harpoon our\\nsheet-iron cetacean and mortally wound it.\\n\\nDuring this period the fish Conseil and I observed differed little\\nfrom those we had already studied in other latitudes. Chief among them\\nwere specimens of that dreadful cartilaginous genus that’s divided\\ninto three subgenera numbering at least thirty-two species: striped\\nsharks five meters long, the head squat and wider than the body, the\\ncaudal fin curved, the back with seven big, black, parallel lines\\nrunning lengthwise; then perlon sharks, ash gray, pierced with seven\\ngill openings, furnished with a single dorsal fin placed almost\\nexactly in the middle of the body.\\n\\nSome big dogfish also passed by, a voracious species of shark if there\\never was one. With some justice, fishermen’s yarns aren’t to be\\ntrusted, but here’s what a few of them relate. Inside the corpse of\\none of these animals there were found a buffalo head and a whole calf;\\nin another, two tuna and a sailor in uniform; in yet another, a\\nsoldier with his saber; in another, finally, a horse with its\\nrider. In candor, none of these sounds like divinely inspired\\ntruth. But the fact remains that not a single dogfish let itself get\\ncaught in the Nautilus’s nets, so I can’t vouch for their voracity.\\n\\nSchools of elegant, playful dolphin swam alongside for entire\\ndays. They went in groups of five or six, hunting in packs like wolves\\nover the countryside; moreover, they’re just as voracious as dogfish,\\nif I can believe a certain Copenhagen professor who says that from one\\ndolphin’s stomach, he removed thirteen porpoises and fifteen\\nseals. True, it was a killer whale, belonging to the biggest known\\nspecies, whose length sometimes exceeds twenty-four feet. The family\\nDelphinia numbers ten genera, and the dolphins I saw were akin to the\\ngenus Delphinorhynchus, remarkable for an extremely narrow muzzle four\\ntimes as long as the cranium. Measuring three meters, their bodies\\nwere black on top, underneath a pinkish white strewn with small, very\\nscattered spots.\\n\\nFrom these seas I’ll also mention some unusual specimens of croakers,\\nfish from the order Acanthopterygia, family Scienidea. Some\\nauthors—more artistic than scientific—claim that these fish are\\nmelodious singers, that their voices in unison put on concerts\\nunmatched by human choristers. I don’t say nay, but to my regret these\\ncroakers didn’t serenade us as we passed.\\n\\nFinally, to conclude, Conseil classified a large number of flying\\nfish. Nothing could have made a more unusual sight than the marvelous\\ntiming with which dolphins hunt these fish. Whatever the range of its\\nflight, however evasive its trajectory (even up and over the\\nNautilus), the hapless flying fish always found a dolphin to welcome\\nit with open mouth. These were either flying gurnards or kitelike sea\\nrobins, whose lips glowed in the dark, at night scrawling fiery\\nstreaks in the air before plunging into the murky waters like so many\\nshooting stars.\\n\\nOur navigating continued under these conditions until March 13. That\\nday the Nautilus was put to work in some depth-sounding experiments\\nthat fascinated me deeply.\\n\\nBy then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point in\\nthe Pacific high seas. Our position fix placed us in latitude 45\\ndegrees 37’ south and longitude 37 degrees 53’ west. These were the\\nsame waterways where Captain Denham, aboard the Herald, payed out\\n14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom. It was here too\\nthat Lieutenant Parker, aboard the American frigate Congress, was\\nunable to reach the underwater soil at 15,149 meters.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo decided to take his Nautilus down to the lowest depths in\\norder to double-check these different soundings. I got ready to record\\nthe results of this experiment. The panels in the lounge opened, and\\nmaneuvers began for reaching those strata so prodigiously far removed.\\n\\nIt was apparently considered out of the question to dive by filling\\nthe ballast tanks. Perhaps they wouldn’t sufficiently increase the\\nNautilus’s specific gravity. Moreover, in order to come back up, it\\nwould be necessary to expel the excess water, and our pumps might not\\nhave been strong enough to overcome the outside pressure.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo decided to make for the ocean floor by submerging on an\\nappropriately gradual diagonal with the help of his side fins, which\\nwere set at a 45 degrees angle to the Nautilus’s waterline. Then the\\npropeller was brought to its maximum speed, and its four blades\\nchurned the waves with indescribable violence.\\n\\nUnder this powerful thrust the Nautilus’s hull quivered like a\\nresonating chord, and the ship sank steadily under the\\nwaters. Stationed in the lounge, the captain and I watched the needle\\nswerving swiftly over the pressure gauge. Soon we had gone below the\\nlivable zone where most fish reside. Some of these animals can thrive\\nonly at the surface of seas or rivers, but a minority can dwell at\\nfairly great depths. Among the latter I observed a species of dogfish\\ncalled the cow shark that’s equipped with six respiratory slits, the\\ntelescope fish with its enormous eyes, the armored gurnard with gray\\nthoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by\\npale red slabs of bone, then finally the grenadier, living at a depth\\nof 1,200 meters, by that point tolerating a pressure of 120\\natmospheres.\\n\\nI asked Captain Nemo if he had observed any fish at more considerable\\ndepths.\\n\\n“Fish? Rarely!” he answered me. “But given the current state of marine\\nscience, who are we to presume, what do we really know of these\\ndepths?”\\n\\n“Just this, captain. In going toward the ocean’s lower strata, we know\\nthat vegetable life disappears more quickly than animal life. We know\\nthat moving creatures can still be encountered where water plants no\\nlonger grow. We know that oysters and pilgrim scallops live in 2,000\\nmeters of water, and that Admiral McClintock, England’s hero of the\\npolar seas, pulled in a live sea star from a depth of 2,500 meters. We\\nknow that the crew of the Royal Navy’s Bulldog fished up a starfish\\nfrom 2,620 fathoms, hence from a depth of more than one vertical\\nleague. Would you still say, Captain Nemo, that we really know\\nnothing?”\\n\\n“No, professor,” the captain replied, “I wouldn’t be so\\ndiscourteous. Yet I’ll ask you to explain how these creatures can live\\nat such depths?”\\n\\n“I explain it on two grounds,” I replied. “In the first place, because\\nvertical currents, which are caused by differences in the water’s\\nsalinity and density, can produce enough motion to sustain the\\nrudimentary lifestyles of sea lilies and starfish.”\\n\\n“True,” the captain put in.\\n\\n“In the second place, because oxygen is the basis of life, and we know\\nthat the amount of oxygen dissolved in salt water increases rather\\nthan decreases with depth, that the pressure in these lower strata\\nhelps to concentrate their oxygen content.”\\n\\n“Oho! We know that, do we?” Captain Nemo replied in a tone of mild\\nsurprise. “Well, professor, we have good reason to know it because\\nit’s the truth. I might add, in fact, that the air bladders of fish\\ncontain more nitrogen than oxygen when these animals are caught at the\\nsurface of the water, and conversely, more oxygen than nitrogen when\\nthey’re pulled up from the lower depths. Which bears out your\\nformulation. But let’s continue our observations.”\\n\\nMy eyes flew back to the pressure gauge. The instrument indicated a\\ndepth of 6,000 meters. Our submergence had been going on for an\\nhour. The Nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins, still\\nsinking. These deserted waters were wonderfully clear, with a\\ntransparency impossible to convey. An hour later we were at 13,000\\nmeters—about three and a quarter vertical leagues—and the ocean floor\\nwas nowhere in sight.\\n\\nHowever, at 14,000 meters I saw blackish peaks rising in the midst of\\nthe waters. But these summits could have belonged to mountains as high\\nor even higher than the Himalayas or Mt. Blanc, and the extent of\\nthese depths remained incalculable.\\n\\nDespite the powerful pressures it was undergoing, the Nautilus sank\\nstill deeper. I could feel its sheet-iron plates trembling down to\\ntheir riveted joins; metal bars arched; bulkheads groaned; the lounge\\nwindows seemed to be warping inward under the water’s pressure. And\\nthis whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way, if, as its\\ncaptain had said, it weren’t capable of resisting like a solid block.\\n\\nWhile grazing these rocky slopes lost under the waters, I still\\nspotted some seashells, tube worms, lively annelid worms from the\\ngenus Spirorbis, and certain starfish specimens.\\n\\nBut soon these last representatives of animal life vanished, and three\\nvertical leagues down, the Nautilus passed below the limits of\\nunderwater existence just as an air balloon rises above the breathable\\nzones in the sky. We reached a depth of 16,000 meters—four vertical\\nleagues—and by then the Nautilus’s plating was tolerating a pressure\\nof 1,600 atmospheres, in other words, 1,600 kilograms per each square\\ncentimeter on its surface!\\n\\n“What an experience!” I exclaimed. “Traveling these deep regions where\\nno man has ever ventured before! Look, captain! Look at these\\nmagnificent rocks, these uninhabited caves, these last global haunts\\nwhere life is no longer possible! What unheard-of scenery, and why are\\nwe reduced to preserving it only as a memory?”\\n\\n“Would you like,” Captain Nemo asked me, “to bring back more than just\\na memory?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“I mean that nothing could be easier than taking a photograph of this\\nunderwater region!”\\n\\nBefore I had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused\\nme, a camera was carried into the lounge at Captain Nemo’s\\nrequest. The liquid setting, electrically lit, unfolded with perfect\\nclarity through the wide-open panels. No shadows, no blurs, thanks to\\nour artificial light. Not even sunshine could have been better for our\\npurposes. With the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its\\nfins, the Nautilus stood still. The camera was aimed at the scenery on\\nthe ocean floor, and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative.\\n\\nI attach a print of the positive. In it you can view these primordial\\nrocks that have never seen the light of day, this nether granite that\\nforms the powerful foundation of our globe, the deep caves cut into\\nthe stony mass, the outlines of incomparable distinctness whose far\\nedges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain Flemish\\npainters. In the distance is a mountainous horizon, a wondrously\\nundulating line that makes up the background of this landscape. The\\ngeneral effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable: black,\\npolished, without moss or other blemish, carved into strange shapes,\\nsitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled beneath our streams\\nof electric light.\\n\\nMeanwhile, his photographic operations over, Captain Nemo told me:\\n\\n“Let’s go back up, professor. We mustn’t push our luck and expose the\\nNautilus too long to these pressures.”\\n\\n“Let’s go back up!” I replied.\\n\\n“Hold on tight.”\\n\\nBefore I had time to realize why the captain made this recommendation,\\nI was hurled to the carpet.\\n\\nIts fins set vertically, its propeller thrown in gear at the captain’s\\nsignal, the Nautilus rose with lightning speed, shooting upward like\\nan air balloon into the sky. Vibrating resonantly, it knifed through\\nthe watery mass. Not a single detail was visible. In four minutes it\\nhad cleared the four vertical leagues separating it from the surface\\nof the ocean, and after emerging like a flying fish, it fell back into\\nthe sea, making the waves leap to prodigious heights.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\nSperm Whales and Baleen Whales\\n\\n\\nDURING THE NIGHT of March 13-14, the Nautilus resumed its southward\\nheading. Once it was abreast of Cape Horn, I thought it would strike\\nwest of the cape, make for Pacific seas, and complete its tour of the\\nworld. It did nothing of the sort and kept moving toward the\\nsouthernmost regions. So where was it bound? The pole? That was\\ninsanity. I was beginning to think that the captain’s recklessness\\nmore than justified Ned Land’s worst fears.\\n\\nFor a good while the Canadian had said nothing more to me about his\\nescape plans. He had become less sociable, almost sullen. I could see\\nhow heavily this protracted imprisonment was weighing on him. I could\\nfeel the anger building in him. Whenever he encountered the captain,\\nhis eyes would flicker with dark fire, and I was in constant dread\\nthat his natural vehemence would cause him to do something rash.\\n\\nThat day, March 14, he and Conseil managed to find me in my\\nstateroom. I asked them the purpose of their visit.\\n\\n“To put a simple question to you, sir,” the Canadian answered me.\\n\\n“Go on, Ned.”\\n\\n“How many men do you think are on board the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“I’m unable to say, my friend.”\\n\\n“It seems to me,” Ned Land went on, “that it wouldn’t take much of a\\ncrew to run a ship like this one.”\\n\\n“Correct,” I replied. “Under existing conditions some ten men at the\\nmost should be enough to operate it.”\\n\\n“All right,” the Canadian said, “then why should there be any more\\nthan that?”\\n\\n“Why?” I answered.\\n\\nI stared at Ned Land, whose motives were easy to guess.\\n\\n“Because,” I said, “if I can trust my hunches, if I truly understand\\nthe captain’s way of life, his Nautilus isn’t simply a ship. It’s\\nmeant to be a refuge for people like its commander, people who have\\nsevered all ties with the shore.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” Conseil said, “but in a nutshell, the Nautilus can hold\\nonly a certain number of men, so couldn’t master estimate their\\nmaximum?”\\n\\n“How, Conseil?”\\n\\n“By calculating it. Master is familiar with the ship’s capacity, hence\\nthe amount of air it contains; on the other hand, master knows how\\nmuch air each man consumes in the act of breathing, and he can compare\\nthis data with the fact that the Nautilus must rise to the surface\\nevery twenty-four hours . . .”\\n\\nConseil didn’t finish his sentence, but I could easily see what he was\\ndriving at.\\n\\n“I follow you,” I said. “But while they’re simple to do, such\\ncalculations can give only a very uncertain figure.”\\n\\n“No problem,” the Canadian went on insistently.\\n\\n“Then here’s how to calculate it,” I replied. “In one hour each man\\nconsumes the oxygen contained in 100 liters of air, hence during\\ntwenty-four hours the oxygen contained in 2,400 liters. Therefore, we\\nmust look for the multiple of 2,400 liters of air that gives us the\\namount found in the Nautilus.”\\n\\n“Precisely,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Now then,” I went on, “the Nautilus’s capacity is 1,500 metric tons,\\nand that of a ton is 1,000 liters, so the Nautilus holds 1,500,000\\nliters of air, which, divided by 2,400 . . .”\\n\\nI did a quick pencil calculation.\\n\\n“. . . gives us the quotient of 625. Which is tantamount to saying\\nthat the air contained in the Nautilus would be exactly enough for 625\\nmen over twenty-four hours.”\\n\\n“625!” Ned repeated.\\n\\n“But rest assured,” I added, “that between passengers, seamen, or\\nofficers, we don’t total one-tenth of that figure.”\\n\\n“Which is still too many for three men!” Conseil muttered.\\n\\n“So, my poor Ned, I can only counsel patience.”\\n\\n“And,” Conseil replied, “even more than patience, resignation.”\\n\\nConseil had said the true word.\\n\\n“Even so,” he went on, “Captain Nemo can’t go south forever! He’ll\\nsurely have to stop, if only at the Ice Bank, and he’ll return to the\\nseas of civilization! Then it will be time to resume Ned Land’s\\nplans.”\\n\\nThe Canadian shook his head, passed his hand over his brow, made no\\nreply, and left us.\\n\\n“With master’s permission, I’ll make an observation to him,” Conseil\\nthen told me. “Our poor Ned broods about all the things he can’t\\nhave. He’s haunted by his former life. He seems to miss everything\\nthat’s denied us. He’s obsessed by his old memories and it’s breaking\\nhis heart. We must understand him. What does he have to occupy him\\nhere? Nothing. He isn’t a scientist like master, and he doesn’t share\\nour enthusiasm for the sea’s wonders. He would risk anything just to\\nenter a tavern in his own country!”\\n\\nTo be sure, the monotony of life on board must have seemed unbearable\\nto the Canadian, who was accustomed to freedom and activity. It was a\\nrare event that could excite him. That day, however, a development\\noccurred that reminded him of his happy years as a harpooner.\\n\\nNear eleven o’clock in the morning, while on the surface of the ocean,\\nthe Nautilus fell in with a herd of baleen whales. This encounter\\ndidn’t surprise me, because I knew these animals were being hunted so\\nrelentlessly that they took refuge in the ocean basins of the high\\nlatitudes.\\n\\nIn the maritime world and in the realm of geographic exploration,\\nwhales have played a major role. This is the animal that first dragged\\nthe Basques in its wake, then Asturian Spaniards, Englishmen, and\\nDutchmen, emboldening them against the ocean’s perils, and leading\\nthem to the ends of the earth. Baleen whales like to frequent the\\nsouthernmost and northernmost seas. Old legends even claim that these\\ncetaceans led fishermen to within a mere seven leagues of the North\\nPole. Although this feat is fictitious, it will someday come true,\\nbecause it’s likely that by hunting whales in the Arctic or Antarctic\\nregions, man will finally reach this unknown spot on the globe.\\n\\nWe were seated on the platform next to a tranquil sea. The month of\\nMarch, since it’s the equivalent of October in these latitudes, was\\ngiving us some fine autumn days. It was the Canadian—on this topic he\\nwas never mistaken—who sighted a baleen whale on the eastern\\nhorizon. If you looked carefully, you could see its blackish back\\nalternately rise and fall above the waves, five miles from the\\nNautilus.\\n\\n“Wow!” Ned Land exclaimed. “If I were on board a whaler, there’s an\\nencounter that would be great fun! That’s one big animal! Look how\\nhigh its blowholes are spouting all that air and steam! Damnation! Why\\nam I chained to this hunk of sheet iron!”\\n\\n“Why, Ned!” I replied. “You still aren’t over your old fishing urges?”\\n\\n“How could a whale fisherman forget his old trade, sir? Who could ever\\nget tired of such exciting hunting?”\\n\\n“You’ve never fished these seas, Ned?”\\n\\n“Never, sir. Just the northernmost seas, equally in the Bering Strait\\nand the Davis Strait.”\\n\\n“So the southern right whale is still unknown to you. Until now it’s\\nthe bowhead whale you’ve hunted, and it won’t risk going past the warm\\nwaters of the equator.”\\n\\n“Oh, professor, what are you feeding me?” the Canadian answered in a\\ntolerably skeptical tone.\\n\\n“I’m feeding you the facts.”\\n\\n“By thunder! In ’65, just two and a half years ago, I to whom you\\nspeak, I myself stepped onto the carcass of a whale near Greenland,\\nand its flank still carried the marked harpoon of a whaling ship from\\nthe Bering Sea. Now I ask you, after it had been wounded west of\\nAmerica, how could this animal be killed in the east, unless it had\\ncleared the equator and doubled Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope?”\\n\\n“I agree with our friend Ned,” Conseil said, “and I’m waiting to hear\\nhow master will reply to him.”\\n\\n“Master will reply, my friends, that baleen whales are localized,\\naccording to species, within certain seas that they never leave. And\\nif one of these animals went from the Bering Strait to the Davis\\nStrait, it’s quite simply because there’s some passageway from the one\\nsea to the other, either along the coasts of Canada or Siberia.”\\n\\n“You expect us to fall for that?” the Canadian asked, tipping me a\\nwink.\\n\\n“If master says so,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Which means,” the Canadian went on, “since I’ve never fished these\\nwaterways, I don’t know the whales that frequent them?”\\n\\n“That’s what I’ve been telling you, Ned.”\\n\\n“All the more reason to get to know them,” Conseil answered.\\n\\n“Look! Look!” the Canadian exclaimed, his voice full of\\nexcitement. “It’s approaching! It’s coming toward us! It’s thumbing\\nits nose at me! It knows I can’t do a blessed thing to it!”\\n\\nNed stamped his foot. Brandishing an imaginary harpoon, his hands\\npositively trembled.\\n\\n“These cetaceans,” he asked, “are they as big as the ones in the\\nnorthernmost seas?”\\n\\n“Pretty nearly, Ned.”\\n\\n“Because I’ve seen big baleen whales, sir, whales measuring up to 100\\nfeet long! I’ve even heard that those rorqual whales off the Aleutian\\nIslands sometimes get over 150 feet.”\\n\\n“That strikes me as exaggerated,” I replied. “Those animals are only\\nmembers of the genus Balaenoptera furnished with dorsal fins, and like\\nsperm whales, they’re generally smaller than the bowhead whale.”\\n\\n“Oh!” exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes hadn’t left the ocean. “It’s\\ngetting closer, it’s coming into the Nautilus’s waters!”\\n\\nThen, going on with his conversation:\\n\\n“You talk about sperm whales,” he said, “as if they were little\\nbeasts! But there are stories of gigantic sperm whales. They’re shrewd\\ncetaceans. I hear that some will cover themselves with algae and fucus\\nplants. People mistake them for islets. They pitch camp on top, make\\nthemselves at home, light a fire—”\\n\\n“Build houses,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Yes, funny man,” Ned Land replied. “Then one fine day the animal\\ndives and drags all its occupants down into the depths.”\\n\\n“Like in the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor,” I answered, laughing. “Oh,\\nMr. Land, you’re addicted to tall tales! What sperm whales you’re\\nhanding us! I hope you don’t really believe in them!”\\n\\n“Mr. Naturalist,” the Canadian replied in all seriousness, “when it\\ncomes to whales, you can believe anything! (Look at that one move!\\nLook at it stealing away!) People claim these animals can circle\\naround the world in just fifteen days.”\\n\\n“I don’t say nay.”\\n\\n“But what you undoubtedly don’t know, Professor Aronnax, is that at\\nthe beginning of the world, whales traveled even quicker.”\\n\\n“Oh really, Ned! And why so?”\\n\\n“Because in those days their tails moved side to side, like those on\\nfish, in other words, their tails were straight up, thrashing the\\nwater from left to right, right to left. But spotting that they swam\\ntoo fast, our Creator twisted their tails, and ever since they’ve been\\nthrashing the waves up and down, at the expense of their speed.”\\n\\n“Fine, Ned,” I said, then resurrected one of the Canadian’s\\nexpressions. “You expect us to fall for that?”\\n\\n“Not too terribly,” Ned Land replied, “and no more than if I told you\\nthere are whales that are 300 feet long and weigh 1,000,000 pounds.”\\n\\n“That’s indeed considerable,” I said. “But you must admit that certain\\ncetaceans do grow to significant size, since they’re said to supply as\\nmuch as 120 metric tons of oil.”\\n\\n“That I’ve seen,” the Canadian said.\\n\\n“I can easily believe it, Ned, just as I can believe that certain\\nbaleen whales equal 100 elephants in bulk. Imagine the impact of such\\na mass if it were launched at full speed!”\\n\\n“Is it true,” Conseil asked, “that they can sink ships?”\\n\\n“Ships? I doubt it,” I replied. “However, they say that in 1820, right\\nin these southern seas, a baleen whale rushed at the Essex and pushed\\nit backward at a speed of four meters per second. Its stern was\\nflooded, and the Essex went down fast.”\\n\\nNed looked at me with a bantering expression.\\n\\n“Speaking for myself,” he said, “I once got walloped by a whale’s\\ntail—in my longboat, needless to say. My companions and I were\\nlaunched to an altitude of six meters. But next to the professor’s\\nwhale, mine was just a baby.”\\n\\n“Do these animals live a long time?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“A thousand years,” the Canadian replied without hesitation.\\n\\n“And how, Ned,” I asked, “do you know that’s so?”\\n\\n“Because people say so.”\\n\\n“And why do people say so?”\\n\\n“Because people know so.”\\n\\n“No, Ned! People don’t know so, they suppose so, and here’s the logic\\nwith which they back up their beliefs. When fishermen first hunted\\nwhales 400 years ago, these animals grew to bigger sizes than they do\\ntoday. Reasonably enough, it’s assumed that today’s whales are smaller\\nbecause they haven’t had time to reach their full growth. That’s why\\nthe Count de Buffon’s encyclopedia says that cetaceans can live, and\\neven must live, for a thousand years. You understand?”\\n\\nNed Land didn’t understand. He no longer even heard me. That baleen\\nwhale kept coming closer. His eyes devoured it.\\n\\n“Oh!” he exclaimed. “It’s not just one whale, it’s ten, twenty, a\\nwhole gam! And I can’t do a thing! I’m tied hand and foot!”\\n\\n“But Ned my friend,” Conseil said, “why not ask Captain Nemo for\\npermission to hunt—”\\n\\nBefore Conseil could finish his sentence, Ned Land scooted down the\\nhatch and ran to look for the captain. A few moments later, the two of\\nthem reappeared on the platform.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo observed the herd of cetaceans cavorting on the waters a\\nmile from the Nautilus.\\n\\n“They’re southern right whales,” he said. “There goes the fortune of a\\nwhole whaling fleet.”\\n\\n“Well, sir,” the Canadian asked, “couldn’t I hunt them, just so I\\ndon’t forget my old harpooning trade?”\\n\\n“Hunt them? What for?” Captain Nemo replied. “Simply to destroy them?\\nWe have no use for whale oil on this ship.”\\n\\n“But, sir,” the Canadian went on, “in the Red Sea you authorized us to\\nchase a dugong!”\\n\\n“There it was an issue of obtaining fresh meat for my crew. Here it\\nwould be killing for the sake of killing. I’m well aware that’s a\\nprivilege reserved for mankind, but I don’t allow such murderous\\npastimes. When your peers, Mr. Land, destroy decent, harmless\\ncreatures like the southern right whale or the bowhead whale, they\\ncommit a reprehensible offense. Thus they’ve already depopulated all\\nof Baffin Bay, and they’ll wipe out a whole class of useful\\nanimals. So leave these poor cetaceans alone. They have quite enough\\nnatural enemies, such as sperm whales, swordfish, and sawfish, without\\nyou meddling with them.”\\n\\nI’ll let the reader decide what faces the Canadian made during this\\nlecture on hunting ethics. Furnishing such arguments to a professional\\nharpooner was a waste of words. Ned Land stared at Captain Nemo and\\nobviously missed his meaning. But the captain was right. Thanks to the\\nmindless, barbaric bloodthirstiness of fishermen, the last baleen\\nwhale will someday disappear from the ocean.\\n\\nNed Land whistled “Yankee Doodle” between his teeth, stuffed his hands\\nin his pockets, and turned his back on us.\\n\\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo studied the herd of cetaceans, then addressed\\nme:\\n\\n“I was right to claim that baleen whales have enough natural enemies\\nwithout counting man. These specimens will soon have to deal with\\nmighty opponents. Eight miles to leeward, Professor Aronnax, can you\\nsee those blackish specks moving about?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain,” I replied.\\n\\n“Those are sperm whales, dreadful animals that I’ve sometimes\\nencountered in herds of 200 or 300! As for them, they’re cruel,\\ndestructive beasts, and they deserve to be exterminated.”\\n\\nThe Canadian turned swiftly at these last words.\\n\\n“Well, captain,” I said, “on behalf of the baleen whales, there’s\\nstill time—”\\n\\n“It’s pointless to run any risks, professor. The Nautilus will suffice\\nto disperse these sperm whales. It’s armed with a steel spur quite\\nequal to Mr. Land’s harpoon, I imagine.”\\n\\nThe Canadian didn’t even bother shrugging his shoulders. Attacking\\ncetaceans with thrusts from a spur! Who ever heard of such malarkey!\\n\\n“Wait and see, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo said. “We’ll show you\\na style of hunting with which you aren’t yet familiar. We’ll take no\\npity on these ferocious cetaceans. They’re merely mouth and teeth!”\\n\\nMouth and teeth! There’s no better way to describe the long-skulled\\nsperm whale, whose length sometimes exceeds twenty-five meters. The\\nenormous head of this cetacean occupies about a third of its\\nbody. Better armed than a baleen whale, whose upper jaw is adorned\\nsolely with whalebone, the sperm whale is equipped with twenty-five\\nhuge teeth that are twenty centimeters high, have cylindrical, conical\\nsummits, and weigh two pounds each. In the top part of this enormous\\nhead, inside big cavities separated by cartilage, you’ll find 300 to\\n400 kilograms of that valuable oil called “spermaceti.” The sperm\\nwhale is an awkward animal, more tadpole than fish, as Professor\\nFrΘdol has noted. It’s poorly constructed, being “defective,” so to\\nspeak, over the whole left side of its frame, with good eyesight only\\nin its right eye.\\n\\nMeanwhile that monstrous herd kept coming closer. It had seen the\\nbaleen whales and was preparing to attack. You could tell in advance\\nthat the sperm whales would be victorious, not only because they were\\nbetter built for fighting than their harmless adversaries, but also\\nbecause they could stay longer underwater before returning to breathe\\nat the surface.\\n\\nThere was just time to run to the rescue of the baleen whales. The\\nNautilus proceeded to midwater. Conseil, Ned, and I sat in front of\\nthe lounge windows. Captain Nemo made his way to the helmsman’s side\\nto operate his submersible as an engine of destruction. Soon I felt\\nthe beats of our propeller getting faster, and we picked up speed.\\n\\nThe battle between sperm whales and baleen whales had already begun\\nwhen the Nautilus arrived. It maneuvered to cut into the herd of\\nlong-skulled predators. At first the latter showed little concern at\\nthe sight of this new monster meddling in the battle. But they soon\\nhad to sidestep its thrusts.\\n\\nWhat a struggle! Ned Land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended up\\napplauding. Brandished in its captain’s hands, the Nautilus was simply\\na fearsome harpoon. He hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran them\\nclean through, leaving behind two squirming animal halves. As for\\nthose daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides, the ship never\\nfelt them. No more than the collisions it caused. One sperm whale\\nexterminated, it ran at another, tacked on the spot so as not to miss\\nits prey, went ahead or astern, obeyed its rudder, dived when the\\ncetacean sank to deeper strata, rose with it when it returned to the\\nsurface, struck it head-on or slantwise, hacked at it or tore it, and\\nfrom every direction and at any speed, skewered it with its dreadful\\nspur.\\n\\nWhat bloodshed! What a hubbub on the surface of the waves! What sharp\\nhisses and snorts unique to these frightened animals! Their tails\\nchurned the normally peaceful strata into actual billows.\\n\\nThis Homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour, and the long-skulled\\npredators couldn’t get away. Several times ten or twelve of them\\nteamed up, trying to crush the Nautilus with their sheer mass. Through\\nthe windows you could see their enormous mouths paved with teeth,\\ntheir fearsome eyes. Losing all self-control, Ned Land hurled threats\\nand insults at them. You could feel them clinging to the submersible\\nlike hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush. But by forcing the\\npace of its propeller, the Nautilus carried them off, dragged them\\nunder, or brought them back to the upper level of the waters,\\nuntroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip.\\n\\nFinally this mass of sperm whales thinned out. The waves grew tranquil\\nagain. I felt us rising to the surface of the ocean. The hatch opened\\nand we rushed onto the platform.\\n\\nThe sea was covered with mutilated corpses. A fearsome explosion\\ncouldn’t have slashed, torn, or shredded these fleshy masses with\\ngreater violence. We were floating in the midst of gigantic bodies,\\nbluish on the back, whitish on the belly, and all deformed by enormous\\nprotuberances. A few frightened sperm whales were fleeing toward the\\nhorizon. The waves were dyed red over an area of several miles, and\\nthe Nautilus was floating in the middle of a sea of blood.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo rejoined us.\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Land?” he said.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had subsided,\\n“it’s a dreadful sight for sure. But I’m a hunter not a butcher, and\\nthis is plain butchery.”\\n\\n“It was a slaughter of destructive animals,” the captain replied, “and\\nthe Nautilus is no butcher knife.”\\n\\n“I prefer my harpoon,” the Canadian answered.\\n\\n“To each his own,” the captain replied, staring intently at Ned Land.\\n\\nI was in dread the latter would give way to some violent outburst that\\nmight have had deplorable consequences. But his anger was diverted by\\nthe sight of a baleen whale that the Nautilus had pulled alongside of\\njust then.\\n\\nThis animal had been unable to escape the teeth of those sperm\\nwhales. I recognized the southern right whale, its head squat, its\\nbody dark all over. Anatomically, it’s distinguished from the white\\nwhale and the black right whale by the fusion of its seven cervical\\nvertebrae, and it numbers two more ribs than its relatives. Floating\\non its side, its belly riddled with bites, the poor cetacean was\\ndead. Still hanging from the tip of its mutilated fin was a little\\nbaby whale that it had been unable to rescue from the slaughter. Its\\nopen mouth let water flow through its whalebone like a murmuring surf.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo guided the Nautilus next to the animal’s corpse. Two of\\nhis men climbed onto the whale’s flank, and to my astonishment, I saw\\nthem draw from its udders all the milk they held, in other words,\\nenough to fill two or three casks.\\n\\nThe captain offered me a cup of this still-warm milk. I couldn’t help\\nshowing my distaste for such a beverage. He assured me that this milk\\nwas excellent, no different from cow’s milk.\\n\\nI sampled it and agreed. So this milk was a worthwhile reserve ration\\nfor us, because in the form of salt butter or cheese, it would provide\\na pleasant change of pace from our standard fare.\\n\\nFrom that day on, I noted with some uneasiness that Ned Land’s\\nattitudes toward Captain Nemo grew worse and worse, and I decided to\\nkeep a close watch on the Canadian’s movements and activities.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nThe Ice Bank\\n\\n\\nTHE NAUTILUS resumed its unruffled southbound heading. It went along\\nthe 50th meridian with considerable speed. Would it go to the pole? I\\ndidn’t think so, because every previous attempt to reach this spot on\\nthe globe had failed. Besides, the season was already quite advanced,\\nsince March 13 on Antarctic shores corresponds with September 13 in\\nthe northernmost regions, which marks the beginning of the equinoctial\\nperiod.\\n\\nOn March 14 at latitude 55 degrees, I spotted floating ice, plain pale\\nbits of rubble twenty to twenty-five feet long, which formed reefs\\nover which the sea burst into foam. The Nautilus stayed on the surface\\nof the ocean. Having fished in the Arctic seas, Ned Land was already\\nfamiliar with the sight of icebergs. Conseil and I were marveling at\\nthem for the first time.\\n\\nIn the sky toward the southern horizon, there stretched a dazzling\\nwhite band. English whalers have given this the name “ice blink.” No\\nmatter how heavy the clouds may be, they can’t obscure this\\nphenomenon. It announces the presence of a pack, or shoal, of ice.\\n\\nIndeed, larger blocks of ice soon appeared, their brilliance varying\\nat the whim of the mists. Some of these masses displayed green veins,\\nas if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate. Others looked\\nlike enormous amethysts, letting the light penetrate their\\ninsides. The latter reflected the sun’s rays from the thousand facets\\nof their crystals. The former, tinted with a bright limestone sheen,\\nwould have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble\\ntown.\\n\\nThe farther down south we went, the more these floating islands grew\\nin numbers and prominence. Polar birds nested on them by the\\nthousands. These were petrels, cape pigeons, or puffins, and their\\ncalls were deafening. Mistaking the Nautilus for the corpse of a\\nwhale, some of them alighted on it and prodded its resonant sheet iron\\nwith pecks of their beaks.\\n\\nDuring this navigating in the midst of the ice, Captain Nemo often\\nstayed on the platform. He observed these deserted waterways\\ncarefully. I saw his calm eyes sometimes perk up. In these polar seas\\nforbidden to man, did he feel right at home, the lord of these\\nunreachable regions? Perhaps. But he didn’t say. He stood still,\\nreviving only when his pilot’s instincts took over. Then, steering his\\nNautilus with consummate dexterity, he skillfully dodged the masses of\\nice, some of which measured several miles in length, their heights\\nvarying from seventy to eighty meters. Often the horizon seemed\\ncompletely closed off. Abreast of latitude 60 degrees, every\\npassageway had disappeared. Searching with care, Captain Nemo soon\\nfound a narrow opening into which he brazenly slipped, well aware,\\nhowever, that it would close behind him.\\n\\nGuided by his skillful hands, the Nautilus passed by all these\\ndifferent masses of ice, which are classified by size and shape with a\\nprecision that enraptured Conseil: “icebergs,” or mountains; “ice\\nfields,” or smooth, limitless tracts; “drift ice,” or floating floes;\\n“packs,” or broken tracts, called “patches” when they’re circular and\\n“streams” when they form long strips.\\n\\nThe temperature was fairly low. Exposed to the outside air, the\\nthermometer marked -2 degrees to\\n\\n-3 degrees centigrade. But we were warmly dressed in furs, for which\\n seals and aquatic bears had paid the price. Evenly heated by all its\\n electric equipment, the Nautilus’s interior defied the most intense\\n cold. Moreover, to find a bearable temperature, the ship had only to\\n sink just a few meters beneath the waves.\\n\\nTwo months earlier we would have enjoyed perpetual daylight in this\\nlatitude; but night already fell for three or four hours, and later it\\nwould cast six months of shadow over these circumpolar regions.\\n\\nOn March 15 we passed beyond the latitude of the South Shetland and\\nSouth Orkney Islands. The captain told me that many tribes of seals\\nused to inhabit these shores; but English and American whalers, in a\\nfrenzy of destruction, slaughtered all the adults, including pregnant\\nfemales, and where life and activity once existed, those fishermen\\nleft behind only silence and death.\\n\\nGoing along the 55th meridian, the Nautilus cut the Antarctic Circle\\non March 16 near eight o’clock in the morning. Ice completely\\nsurrounded us and closed off the horizon. Nevertheless, Captain Nemo\\nwent from passageway to passageway, always proceeding south.\\n\\n“But where’s he going?” I asked.\\n\\n“Straight ahead,” Conseil replied. “Ultimately, when he can’t go any\\nfarther, he’ll stop.”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t bet on it!” I replied.\\n\\nAnd in all honesty, I confess that this venturesome excursion was far\\nfrom displeasing to me. I can’t express the intensity of my amazement\\nat the beauties of these new regions. The ice struck superb\\nposes. Here, its general effect suggested an oriental town with\\ncountless minarets and mosques. There, a city in ruins, flung to the\\nground by convulsions in the earth. These views were varied\\ncontinuously by the sun’s oblique rays, or were completely swallowed\\nup by gray mists in the middle of blizzards. Then explosions,\\ncave-ins, and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us,\\naltering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama.\\n\\nIf the Nautilus was submerged during these losses of balance, we heard\\nthe resulting noises spread under the waters with frightful intensity,\\nand the collapse of these masses created daunting eddies down to the\\nocean’s lower strata. The Nautilus then rolled and pitched like a ship\\nleft to the fury of the elements.\\n\\nOften, no longer seeing any way out, I thought we were imprisoned for\\ngood, but Captain Nemo, guided by his instincts, discovered new\\npassageways from the tiniest indications. He was never wrong when he\\nobserved slender threads of bluish water streaking through these ice\\nfields. Accordingly, I was sure that he had already risked his\\nNautilus in the midst of the Antarctic seas.\\n\\nHowever, during the day of March 16, these tracts of ice completely\\nbarred our path. It wasn’t the Ice Bank as yet, just huge ice fields\\ncemented together by the cold. This obstacle couldn’t stop Captain\\nNemo, and he launched his ship against the ice fields with hideous\\nviolence. The Nautilus went into these brittle masses like a wedge,\\nsplitting them with dreadful cracklings. It was an old-fashioned\\nbattering ram propelled with infinite power. Hurled aloft, ice rubble\\nfell back around us like hail. Through brute force alone, the\\nsubmersible carved out a channel for itself. Carried away by its\\nmomentum, the ship sometimes mounted on top of these tracts of ice and\\ncrushed them with its weight, or at other times, when cooped up\\nbeneath the ice fields, it split them with simple pitching movements,\\ncreating wide punctures.\\n\\nViolent squalls assaulted us during the daytime. Thanks to certain\\nheavy mists, we couldn’t see from one end of the platform to the\\nother. The wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass. The\\nsnow was piling up in such packed layers, it had to be chipped loose\\nwith blows from picks. Even in a temperature of merely -5 degrees\\ncentigrade, every outside part of the Nautilus was covered with ice. A\\nship’s rigging would have been unusable, because all its tackle would\\nhave jammed in the grooves of the pulleys. Only a craft without sails,\\ndriven by an electric motor that needed no coal, could face such high\\nlatitudes.\\n\\nUnder these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low. It\\nfell as far as 73.5 centimeters. Our compass indications no longer\\noffered any guarantees. The deranged needles would mark contradictory\\ndirections as we approached the southern magnetic pole, which doesn’t\\ncoincide with the South Pole proper. In fact, according to the\\nastronomer Hansteen, this magnetic pole is located fairly close to\\nlatitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees, or abiding by the\\nobservations of Louis-Isidore Duperrey, in longitude 135 degrees and\\nlatitude 70 degrees 30’. Hence we had to transport compasses to\\ndifferent parts of the ship, take many readings, and strike an\\naverage. Often we could chart our course only by guesswork, a less\\nthan satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways\\nwhose landmarks change continuously.\\n\\nAt last on March 18, after twenty futile assaults, the Nautilus was\\ndecisively held in check. No longer was it an ice stream, patch, or\\nfield—it was an endless, immovable barrier formed by ice mountains\\nfused to each other.\\n\\n“The Ice Bank!” the Canadian told me.\\n\\nFor Ned Land, as well as for every navigator before us, I knew that\\nthis was the great insurmountable obstacle. When the sun appeared for\\nan instant near noon, Captain Nemo took a reasonably accurate sight\\nthat gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30’ and latitude 67\\ndegrees 39’ south. This was a position already well along in these\\nAntarctic regions.\\n\\nAs for the liquid surface of the sea, there was no longer any\\nsemblance of it before our eyes. Before the Nautilus’s spur there lay\\nvast broken plains, a tangle of confused chunks with all the\\nhelter-skelter unpredictability typical of a river’s surface a short\\nwhile before its ice breakup; but in this case the proportions were\\ngigantic. Here and there stood sharp peaks, lean spires that rose as\\nhigh as 200 feet; farther off, a succession of steeply cut cliffs\\nsporting a grayish tint, huge mirrors that reflected the sparse rays\\nof a sun half drowned in mist. Beyond, a stark silence reigned in this\\ndesolate natural setting, a silence barely broken by the flapping\\nwings of petrels or puffins. By this point everything was frozen, even\\nsound.\\n\\nSo the Nautilus had to halt in its venturesome course among these\\ntracts of ice.\\n\\n“Sir,” Ned Land told me that day, “if your captain goes any farther\\n. . .”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“He’ll be a superman.”\\n\\n“How so, Ned?”\\n\\n“Because nobody can clear the Ice Bank. Your captain’s a powerful man,\\nbut damnation, he isn’t more powerful than nature. If she draws a\\nboundary line, there you stop, like it or not!”\\n\\n“Correct, Ned Land, but I still want to know what’s behind this Ice\\nBank! Behold my greatest source of irritation—a wall!”\\n\\n“Master is right,” Conseil said. “Walls were invented simply to\\nfrustrate scientists. All walls should be banned.”\\n\\n“Fine!” the Canadian put in. “But we already know what’s behind this\\nIce Bank.”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\n“Ice, ice, and more ice.”\\n\\n“You may be sure of that, Ned,” I answered, “but I’m not. That’s why I\\nwant to see for myself.”\\n\\n“Well, professor,” the Canadian replied, “you can just drop that idea!\\nYou’ve made it to the Ice Bank, which is already far enough, but you\\nwon’t get any farther, neither your Captain Nemo or his Nautilus. And\\nwhether he wants to or not, we’ll head north again, in other words, to\\nthe land of sensible people.”\\n\\nI had to agree that Ned Land was right, and until ships are built to\\nnavigate over tracts of ice, they’ll have to stop at the Ice Bank.\\n\\nIndeed, despite its efforts, despite the powerful methods it used to\\nsplit this ice, the Nautilus was reduced to immobility. Ordinarily,\\nwhen someone can’t go any farther, he still has the option of\\nreturning in his tracks. But here it was just as impossible to turn\\nback as to go forward, because every passageway had closed behind us,\\nand if our submersible remained even slightly stationary, it would be\\nfrozen in without delay. Which is exactly what happened near two\\no’clock in the afternoon, and fresh ice kept forming over the ship’s\\nsides with astonishing speed. I had to admit that Captain Nemo’s\\nleadership had been most injudicious.\\n\\nJust then I was on the platform. Observing the situation for some\\nwhile, the captain said to me:\\n\\n“Well, professor! What think you?”\\n\\n“I think we’re trapped, captain.”\\n\\n“Trapped! What do you mean?”\\n\\n“I mean we can’t go forward, backward, or sideways. I think that’s the\\nstandard definition of ‘trapped,’ at least in the civilized world.”\\n\\n“So, Professor Aronnax, you think the Nautilus won’t be able to float\\nclear?”\\n\\n“Only with the greatest difficulty, captain, since the season is\\nalready too advanced for you to depend on an ice breakup.”\\n\\n“Oh, professor,” Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone, “you never\\nchange! You see only impediments and obstacles! I promise you, not\\nonly will the Nautilus float clear, it will go farther still!”\\n\\n“Farther south?” I asked, gaping at the captain.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, it will go to the pole.”\\n\\n“To the pole!” I exclaimed, unable to keep back a movement of\\ndisbelief.\\n\\n“Yes,” the captain replied coolly, “the Antarctic pole, that unknown\\nspot crossed by every meridian on the globe. As you know, I do\\nwhatever I like with my Nautilus.”\\n\\nYes, I did know that! I knew this man was daring to the point of being\\nfoolhardy. But to overcome all the obstacles around the South\\nPole—even more unattainable than the North Pole, which still hadn’t\\nbeen reached by the boldest navigators—wasn’t this an absolutely\\ninsane undertaking, one that could occur only in the brain of a\\nmadman?\\n\\nIt then dawned on me to ask Captain Nemo if he had already discovered\\nthis pole, which no human being had ever trod underfoot.\\n\\n“No, sir,” he answered me, “but we’ll discover it together. Where\\nothers have failed, I’ll succeed. Never before has my Nautilus cruised\\nso far into these southernmost seas, but I repeat: it will go farther\\nstill.”\\n\\n“I’d like to believe you, captain,” I went on in a tone of some\\nsarcasm. “Oh I do believe you! Let’s forge ahead! There are no\\nobstacles for us! Let’s shatter this Ice Bank! Let’s blow it up, and\\nif it still resists, let’s put wings on the Nautilus and fly over it!”\\n\\n“Over it, professor?” Captain Nemo replied serenely. “No, not over it,\\nbut under it.”\\n\\n“Under it!” I exclaimed.\\n\\nA sudden insight into Captain Nemo’s plans had just flashed through my\\nmind. I understood. The marvelous talents of his Nautilus would be put\\nto work once again in this superhuman undertaking!\\n\\n“I can see we’re starting to understand each other, professor,”\\nCaptain Nemo told me with a half smile. “You already glimpse the\\npotential—myself, I’d say the success—of this attempt. Maneuvers that\\naren’t feasible for an ordinary ship are easy for the Nautilus. If a\\ncontinent emerges at the pole, we’ll stop at that continent. But on\\nthe other hand, if open sea washes the pole, we’ll go to that very\\nplace!”\\n\\n“Right,” I said, carried away by the captain’s logic. “Even though the\\nsurface of the sea has solidified into ice, its lower strata are still\\nopen, thanks to that divine justice that puts the maximum density of\\nsalt water one degree above its freezing point. And if I’m not\\nmistaken, the submerged part of this Ice Bank is in a four-to-one\\nratio to its emerging part.”\\n\\n“Very nearly, professor. For each foot of iceberg above the sea, there\\nare three more below. Now then, since these ice mountains don’t exceed\\na height of 100 meters, they sink only to a depth of 300 meters. And\\nwhat are 300 meters to the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“A mere nothing, sir.”\\n\\n“We could even go to greater depths and find that temperature layer\\ncommon to all ocean water, and there we’d brave with impunity the -30\\ndegrees or -40 degrees cold on the surface.”\\n\\n“True, sir, very true,” I replied with growing excitement.\\n\\n“Our sole difficulty,” Captain Nemo went on, “lies in our staying\\nsubmerged for several days without renewing our air supply.”\\n\\n“That’s all?” I answered. “The Nautilus has huge air tanks; we’ll fill\\nthem up and they’ll supply all the oxygen we need.”\\n\\n“Good thinking, Professor Aronnax,” the captain replied with a\\nsmile. “But since I don’t want to be accused of foolhardiness, I’m\\ngiving you all my objections in advance.”\\n\\n“You have more?”\\n\\n“Just one. If a sea exists at the South Pole, it’s possible this sea\\nmay be completely frozen over, so we couldn’t come up to the surface!”\\n\\n“My dear sir, have you forgotten that the Nautilus is armed with a\\nfearsome spur? Couldn’t it be launched diagonally against those tracts\\nof ice, which would break open from the impact?”\\n\\n“Ah, professor, you’re full of ideas today!”\\n\\n“Besides, captain,” I added with still greater enthusiasm, “why\\nwouldn’t we find open sea at the South Pole just as at the North Pole?\\nThe cold-temperature poles and the geographical poles don’t coincide\\nin either the northern or southern hemispheres, and until proof to the\\ncontrary, we can assume these two spots on the earth feature either a\\ncontinent or an ice-free ocean.”\\n\\n“I think as you do, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo replied. “I’ll\\nonly point out that after raising so many objections against my plan,\\nyou’re now crushing me under arguments in its favor.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was right. I was outdoing him in daring! It was I who was\\nsweeping him to the pole. I was leading the way, I was out in front\\n. . . but no, you silly fool! Captain Nemo already knew the pros and\\ncons of this question, and it amused him to see you flying off into\\nimpossible fantasies!\\n\\nNevertheless, he didn’t waste an instant. At his signal, the chief\\nofficer appeared. The two men held a quick exchange in their\\nincomprehensible language, and either the chief officer had been\\nalerted previously or he found the plan feasible, because he showed no\\nsurprise.\\n\\nBut as unemotional as he was, he couldn’t have been more impeccably\\nemotionless than Conseil when I told the fine lad our intention of\\npushing on to the South Pole. He greeted my announcement with the\\nusual “As master wishes,” and I had to be content with that. As for\\nNed Land, no human shoulders ever executed a higher shrug than the\\npair belonging to our Canadian.\\n\\n“Honestly, sir,” he told me. “You and your Captain Nemo, I pity you\\nboth!”\\n\\n“But we will go to the pole, Mr. Land.”\\n\\n“Maybe, but you won’t come back!”\\n\\nAnd Ned Land reentered his cabin, “to keep from doing something\\ndesperate,” he said as he left me.\\n\\nMeanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under\\nway. The Nautilus’s powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and\\nstored it under high pressure. Near four o’clock Captain Nemo informed\\nme that the platform hatches were about to be closed. I took a last\\nlook at the dense Ice Bank we were going to conquer. The weather was\\nfair, the skies reasonably clear, the cold quite brisk, namely -12\\ndegrees centigrade; but after the wind had lulled, this temperature\\ndidn’t seem too unbearable.\\n\\nEquipped with picks, some ten men climbed onto the Nautilus’s sides\\nand cracked loose the ice around the ship’s lower plating, which was\\nsoon set free. This operation was swiftly executed because the fresh\\nice was still thin. We all reentered the interior. The main ballast\\ntanks were filled with the water that hadn’t yet congealed at our line\\nof flotation. The Nautilus submerged without delay.\\n\\nI took a seat in the lounge with Conseil. Through the open window we\\nstared at the lower strata of this southernmost ocean. The thermometer\\nrose again. The needle on the pressure gauge swerved over its dial.\\n\\nAbout 300 meters down, just as Captain Nemo had predicted, we cruised\\nbeneath the undulating surface of the Ice Bank. But the Nautilus sank\\ndeeper still. It reached a depth of 800 meters. At the surface this\\nwater gave a temperature of -12 degrees centigrade, but now it gave no\\nmore than -10 degrees. Two degrees had already been gained. Thanks to\\nits heating equipment, the Nautilus’s temperature, needless to say,\\nstayed at a much higher degree. Every maneuver was accomplished with\\nextraordinary precision.\\n\\n“With all due respect to master,” Conseil told me, “we’ll pass it by.”\\n\\n“I fully expect to!” I replied in a tone of deep conviction.\\n\\nNow in open water, the Nautilus took a direct course to the pole\\nwithout veering from the 52nd meridian. From 67 degrees 30’ to 90\\ndegrees, twenty-two and a half degrees of latitude were left to cross,\\nin other words, slightly more than 500 leagues. The Nautilus adopted\\nan average speed of twenty-six miles per hour, the speed of an express\\ntrain. If it kept up this pace, forty hours would do it for reaching\\nthe pole.\\n\\nFor part of the night, the novelty of our circumstances kept Conseil\\nand me at the lounge window. The sea was lit by our beacon’s electric\\nrays. But the depths were deserted. Fish didn’t linger in these\\nimprisoned waters. Here they found merely a passageway for going from\\nthe Antarctic Ocean to open sea at the pole. Our progress was\\nswift. You could feel it in the vibrations of the long steel hull.\\n\\nNear two o’clock in the morning, I went to snatch a few hours of\\nsleep. Conseil did likewise. I didn’t encounter Captain Nemo while\\ngoing down the gangways. I assumed that he was keeping to the\\npilothouse.\\n\\nThe next day, March 19, at five o’clock in the morning, I was back at\\nmy post in the lounge. The electric log indicated that the Nautilus\\nhad reduced speed. By then it was rising to the surface, but\\ncautiously, while slowly emptying its ballast tanks.\\n\\nMy heart was pounding. Would we emerge into the open and find the\\npolar air again?\\n\\nNo. A jolt told me that the Nautilus had bumped the underbelly of the\\nIce Bank, still quite thick to judge from the hollowness of the\\naccompanying noise. Indeed, we had “struck bottom,” to use nautical\\nterminology, but in the opposite direction and at a depth of 3,000\\nfeet. That gave us 4,000 feet of ice overhead, of which 1,000 feet\\nemerged above water. So the Ice Bank was higher here than we had found\\nit on the outskirts. A circumstance less than encouraging.\\n\\nSeveral times that day, the Nautilus repeated the same experiment and\\nalways it bumped against this surface that formed a ceiling above\\nit. At certain moments the ship encountered ice at a depth of 900\\nmeters, denoting a thickness of 1,200 meters, of which 300 meters rose\\nabove the level of the ocean. This height had tripled since the moment\\nthe Nautilus had dived beneath the waves.\\n\\nI meticulously noted these different depths, obtaining the underwater\\nprofile of this upside-down mountain chain that stretched beneath the\\nsea.\\n\\nBy evening there was still no improvement in our situation. The ice\\nstayed between 400 and 500 meters deep. It was obviously shrinking,\\nbut what a barrier still lay between us and the surface of the ocean!\\n\\nBy then it was eight o’clock. The air inside the Nautilus should have\\nbeen renewed four hours earlier, following daily practice on\\nboard. But I didn’t suffer very much, although Captain Nemo hadn’t yet\\nmade demands on the supplementary oxygen in his air tanks.\\n\\nThat night my sleep was fitful. Hope and fear besieged me by turns. I\\ngot up several times. The Nautilus continued groping. Near three\\no’clock in the morning, I observed that we encountered the Ice Bank’s\\nunderbelly at a depth of only fifty meters. So only 150 feet separated\\nus from the surface of the water. Little by little the Ice Bank was\\nturning into an ice field again. The mountains were changing back into\\nplains.\\n\\nMy eyes didn’t leave the pressure gauge. We kept rising on a diagonal,\\ngoing along this shiny surface that sparkled beneath our electric\\nrays. Above and below, the Ice Bank was subsiding in long\\ngradients. Mile after mile it was growing thinner.\\n\\nFinally, at six o’clock in the morning on that memorable day of March\\n19, the lounge door opened. Captain Nemo appeared.\\n\\n“Open sea!” he told me.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nThe South Pole\\n\\n\\nI RUSHED UP onto the platform. Yes, open sea! Barely a few sparse\\nfloes, some moving icebergs; a sea stretching into the distance; hosts\\nof birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters, which varied\\nfrom intense blue to olive green depending on the depth. The\\nthermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade. It was as if a comparative\\nspringtime had been locked up behind that Ice Bank, whose distant\\nmasses were outlined on the northern horizon.\\n\\n“Are we at the pole?” I asked the captain, my heart pounding.\\n\\n“I’ve no idea,” he answered me. “At noon we’ll fix our position.”\\n\\n“But will the sun show through this mist?” I said, staring at the\\ngrayish sky.\\n\\n“No matter how faintly it shines, it will be enough for me,” the\\ncaptain replied.\\n\\nTo the south, ten miles from the Nautilus, a solitary islet rose to a\\nheight of 200 meters. We proceeded toward it, but cautiously, because\\nthis sea could have been strewn with reefs.\\n\\nIn an hour we had reached the islet. Two hours later we had completed\\na full circle around it. It measured four to five miles in\\ncircumference. A narrow channel separated it from a considerable\\nshore, perhaps a continent whose limits we couldn’t see. The existence\\nof this shore seemed to bear out Commander Maury’s hypotheses. In\\nessence, this ingenious American has noted that between the South Pole\\nand the 60th parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of\\ndimensions much greater than any found in the north Atlantic. From\\nthis fact he drew the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle must\\ncontain considerable shores, since icebergs can’t form on the high\\nseas but only along coastlines. According to his calculations, this\\nfrozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose\\nwidth must reach 4,000 kilometers.\\n\\nMeanwhile, to avoid running aground, the Nautilus halted three cable\\nlengths from a strand crowned by superb piles of rocks. The skiff was\\nlaunched to sea. Two crewmen carrying instruments, the captain,\\nConseil, and I were on board. It was ten o’clock in the morning. I\\nhadn’t seen Ned Land. No doubt, in the presence of the South Pole, the\\nCanadian hated having to eat his words.\\n\\nA few strokes of the oar brought the skiff to the sand, where it ran\\naground. Just as Conseil was about to jump ashore, I held him back.\\n\\n“Sir,” I told Captain Nemo, “to you belongs the honor of first setting\\nfoot on this shore.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” the captain replied, “and if I have no hesitation in\\ntreading this polar soil, it’s because no human being until now has\\nleft a footprint here.”\\n\\nSo saying, he leaped lightly onto the sand. His heart must have been\\nthrobbing with intense excitement. He scaled an overhanging rock that\\nended in a small promontory and there, mute and motionless, with\\ncrossed arms and blazing eyes, he seemed to be laying claim to these\\nsouthernmost regions. After spending five minutes in this trance, he\\nturned to us.\\n\\n“Whenever you’re ready, sir,” he called to me.\\n\\nI got out, Conseil at my heels, leaving the two men in the skiff.\\n\\nOver an extensive area, the soil consisted of that igneous gravel\\ncalled “tuff,” reddish in color as if made from crushed bricks. The\\nground was covered with slag, lava flows, and pumice stones. Its\\nvolcanic origin was unmistakable. In certain localities thin smoke\\nholes gave off a sulfurous odor, showing that the inner fires still\\nkept their wide-ranging power. Nevertheless, when I scaled a high\\nescarpment, I could see no volcanoes within a radius of several\\nmiles. In these Antarctic districts, as is well known, Sir James Clark\\nRoss had found the craters of Mt. Erebus and Mt. Terror in fully\\nactive condition on the 167th meridian at latitude 77 degrees 32’.\\n\\nThe vegetation on this desolate continent struck me as quite\\nlimited. A few lichens of the species Usnea melanoxanthra sprawled\\nover the black rocks. The whole meager flora of this region consisted\\nof certain microscopic buds, rudimentary diatoms made up of a type of\\ncell positioned between two quartz-rich shells, plus long purple and\\ncrimson fucus plants, buoyed by small air bladders and washed up on\\nthe coast by the surf.\\n\\nThe beach was strewn with mollusks: small mussels, limpets, smooth\\nheart-shaped cockles, and especially some sea butterflies with oblong,\\nmembrane-filled bodies whose heads are formed from two rounded\\nlobes. I also saw myriads of those northernmost sea butterflies three\\ncentimeters long, which a baleen whale can swallow by the thousands in\\none gulp. The open waters at the shoreline were alive with these\\ndelightful pteropods, true butterflies of the sea.\\n\\nAmong other zoophytes present in these shallows, there were a few\\ncoral tree forms that, according to Sir James Clark Ross, live in\\nthese Antarctic seas at depths as great as 1,000 meters; then small\\nalcyon coral belonging to the species Procellaria pelagica, also a\\nlarge number of starfish unique to these climes, plus some feather\\nstars spangling the sand.\\n\\nBut it was in the air that life was superabundant. There various\\nspecies of birds flew and fluttered by the thousands, deafening us\\nwith their calls. Crowding the rocks, other fowl watched without fear\\nas we passed and pressed familiarly against our feet. These were auks,\\nas agile and supple in water, where they are sometimes mistaken for\\nfast bonito, as they are clumsy and heavy on land. They uttered\\noutlandish calls and participated in numerous public assemblies that\\nfeatured much noise but little action.\\n\\nAmong other fowl I noted some sheathbills from the wading-bird family,\\nthe size of pigeons, white in color, the beak short and conical, the\\neyes framed by red circles. Conseil laid in a supply of them, because\\nwhen they’re properly cooked, these winged creatures make a pleasant\\ndish. In the air there passed sooty albatross with four-meter\\nwingspans, birds aptly dubbed “vultures of the ocean,” also gigantic\\npetrels including several with arching wings, enthusiastic eaters of\\nseal that are known as quebrantahuesos,* and cape pigeons, a sort of\\nsmall duck, the tops of their bodies black and white—in short, a whole\\nseries of petrels, some whitish with wings trimmed in brown, others\\nblue and exclusive to these Antarctic seas, the former “so oily,” I\\ntold Conseil, “that inhabitants of the Faroe Islands simply fit the\\nbird with a wick, then light it up.”\\n\\n*Spanish: “ospreys.” Ed.\\n\\n“With that minor addition,” Conseil replied, “these fowl would make\\nperfect lamps! After this, we should insist that nature equip them\\nwith wicks in advance!”\\n\\nHalf a mile farther on, the ground was completely riddled with penguin\\nnests, egg-laying burrows from which numerous birds emerged. Later\\nCaptain Nemo had hundreds of them hunted because their black flesh is\\nhighly edible. They brayed like donkeys. The size of a goose with\\nslate-colored bodies, white undersides, and lemon-colored neck bands,\\nthese animals let themselves be stoned to death without making any\\neffort to get away.\\n\\nMeanwhile the mists didn’t clear, and by eleven o’clock the sun still\\nhadn’t made an appearance. Its absence disturbed me. Without it, no\\nsights were possible. Then how could we tell whether we had reached\\nthe pole?\\n\\nWhen I rejoined Captain Nemo, I found him leaning silently against a\\npiece of rock and staring at the sky. He seemed impatient,\\nbaffled. But what could we do? This daring and powerful man couldn’t\\ncontrol the sun as he did the sea.\\n\\nNoon arrived without the orb of day appearing for a single\\ninstant. You couldn’t even find its hiding place behind the curtain of\\nmist. And soon this mist began to condense into snow.\\n\\n“Until tomorrow,” the captain said simply; and we went back to the\\nNautilus, amid flurries in the air.\\n\\nDuring our absence the nets had been spread, and I observed with\\nfascination the fish just hauled on board. The Antarctic seas serve as\\na refuge for an extremely large number of migratory fish that flee\\nfrom storms in the subpolar zones, in truth only to slide down the\\ngullets of porpoises and seals. I noted some one-decimeter southern\\nbullhead, a species of whitish cartilaginous fish overrun with bluish\\ngray stripes and armed with stings, then some Antarctic rabbitfish\\nthree feet long, the body very slender, the skin a smooth silver\\nwhite, the head rounded, the topside furnished with three fins, the\\nsnout ending in a trunk that curved back toward the mouth. I sampled\\nits flesh but found it tasteless, despite Conseil’s views, which were\\nlargely approving.\\n\\nThe blizzard lasted until the next day. It was impossible to stay on\\nthe platform. From the lounge, where I was writing up the incidents of\\nthis excursion to the polar continent, I could hear the calls of\\npetrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil. The\\nNautilus didn’t stay idle, and cruising along the coast, it advanced\\nsome ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it\\nskimmed the edge of the horizon.\\n\\nThe next day, March 20, it stopped snowing. The cold was a little more\\nbrisk. The thermometer marked -2 degrees centigrade. The mist had\\ncleared, and on that day I hoped our noon sights could be\\naccomplished.\\n\\nSince Captain Nemo hadn’t yet appeared, only Conseil and I were taken\\nashore by the skiff. The soil’s nature was still the same:\\nvolcanic. Traces of lava, slag, and basaltic rock were everywhere, but\\nI couldn’t find the crater that had vomited them up. There as yonder,\\nmyriads of birds enlivened this part of the polar continent. But they\\nhad to share their dominion with huge herds of marine mammals that\\nlooked at us with gentle eyes. These were seals of various species,\\nsome stretched out on the ground, others lying on drifting ice floes,\\nseveral leaving or reentering the sea. Having never dealt with man,\\nthey didn’t run off at our approach, and I counted enough of them\\nthereabouts to provision a couple hundred ships.\\n\\n“Ye gods,” Conseil said, “it’s fortunate that Ned Land didn’t come\\nwith us!”\\n\\n“Why so, Conseil?”\\n\\n“Because that madcap hunter would kill every animal here.”\\n\\n“Every animal may be overstating it, but in truth I doubt we could\\nkeep our Canadian friend from harpooning some of these magnificent\\ncetaceans. Which would be an affront to Captain Nemo, since he hates\\nto slay harmless beasts needlessly.”\\n\\n“He’s right.”\\n\\n“Certainly, Conseil. But tell me, haven’t you finished classifying\\nthese superb specimens of marine fauna?”\\n\\n“Master is well aware,” Conseil replied, “that I’m not seasoned in\\npractical application. When master has told me these animals’ names\\n. . .”\\n\\n“They’re seals and walruses.”\\n\\n“Two genera,” our scholarly Conseil hastened to say, “that belong to\\nthe family Pinnipedia, order Carnivora, group Unguiculata, subclass\\nMonodelphia, class Mammalia, branch Vertebrata.”\\n\\n“Very nice, Conseil,” I replied, “but these two genera of seals and\\nwalruses are each divided into species, and if I’m not mistaken, we\\nnow have a chance to actually look at them. Let’s.”\\n\\nIt was eight o’clock in the morning. We had four hours to ourselves\\nbefore the sun could be productively observed. I guided our steps\\ntoward a huge bay that made a crescent-shaped incision in the granite\\ncliffs along the beach.\\n\\nThere, all about us, I swear that the shores and ice floes were\\ncrowded with marine mammals as far as the eye could see, and I\\ninvoluntarily looked around for old Proteus, that mythological\\nshepherd who guarded King Neptune’s immense flocks. To be specific,\\nthese were seals. They formed distinct male-and-female groups, the\\nfather watching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones,\\nthe stronger youngsters emancipated a few paces away. When these\\nmammals wanted to relocate, they moved in little jumps made by\\ncontracting their bodies, clumsily helped by their imperfectly\\ndeveloped flippers, which, as with their manatee relatives, form\\nactual forearms. In the water, their ideal element, I must say these\\nanimals swim wonderfully thanks to their flexible backbones, narrow\\npelvises, close-cropped hair, and webbed feet. Resting on shore, they\\nassumed extremely graceful positions. Consequently, their gentle\\nfeatures, their sensitive expressions equal to those of the loveliest\\nwomen, their soft, limpid eyes, their charming poses, led the ancients\\nto glorify them by metamorphosing the males into sea gods and the\\nfemales into mermaids.\\n\\nI drew Conseil’s attention to the considerable growth of the cerebral\\nlobes found in these intelligent cetaceans. No mammal except man has\\nmore abundant cerebral matter. Accordingly, seals are quite capable of\\nbeing educated; they make good pets, and together with certain other\\nnaturalists, I think these animals can be properly trained to perform\\nyeoman service as hunting dogs for fishermen.\\n\\nMost of these seals were sleeping on the rocks or the sand. Among\\nthose properly termed seals—which have no external ears, unlike sea\\nlions whose ears protrude—I observed several varieties of the species\\nstenorhynchus, three meters long, with white hair, bulldog heads, and\\narmed with ten teeth in each jaw: four incisors in both the upper and\\nlower, plus two big canines shaped like the fleur-de-lis. Among them\\nslithered some sea elephants, a type of seal with a short, flexible\\ntrunk; these are the giants of the species, with a circumference of\\ntwenty feet and a length of ten meters. They didn’t move as we\\napproached.\\n\\n“Are these animals dangerous?” Conseil asked me.\\n\\n“Only if they’re attacked,” I replied. “But when these giant seals\\ndefend their little ones, their fury is dreadful, and it isn’t rare\\nfor them to smash a fisherman’s longboat to bits.”\\n\\n“They’re within their rights,” Conseil answered.\\n\\n“I don’t say nay.”\\n\\nTwo miles farther on, we were stopped by a promontory that screened\\nthe bay from southerly winds. It dropped straight down to the sea, and\\nsurf foamed against it. From beyond this ridge there came fearsome\\nbellows, such as a herd of cattle might produce.\\n\\n“Gracious,” Conseil put in, “a choir of bulls?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, “a choir of walruses.”\\n\\n“Are they fighting with each other?”\\n\\n“Either fighting or playing.”\\n\\n“With all due respect to master, this we must see.”\\n\\n“Then see it we must, Conseil.”\\n\\nAnd there we were, climbing these blackish rocks amid sudden\\nlandslides and over stones slippery with ice. More than once I took a\\ntumble at the expense of my backside. Conseil, more cautious or more\\nstable, barely faltered and would help me up, saying:\\n\\n“If master’s legs would kindly adopt a wider stance, master will keep\\nhis balance.”\\n\\nArriving at the topmost ridge of this promontory, I could see vast\\nwhite plains covered with walruses. These animals were playing among\\nthemselves. They were howling not in anger but in glee.\\n\\nWalruses resemble seals in the shape of their bodies and the\\narrangement of their limbs. But their lower jaws lack canines and\\nincisors, and as for their upper canines, they consist of two tusks\\neighty centimeters long with a circumference of thirty-three\\ncentimeters at the socket. Made of solid ivory, without striations,\\nharder than elephant tusks, and less prone to yellowing, these teeth\\nare in great demand. Accordingly, walruses are the victims of a\\nmindless hunting that soon will destroy them all, since their hunters\\nindiscriminately slaughter pregnant females and youngsters, and over\\n4,000 individuals are destroyed annually.\\n\\nPassing near these unusual animals, I could examine them at my leisure\\nsince they didn’t stir. Their hides were rough and heavy, a tan color\\nleaning toward a reddish brown; their coats were short and less than\\nabundant. Some were four meters long. More tranquil and less fearful\\nthan their northern relatives, they posted no sentinels on guard duty\\nat the approaches to their campsite.\\n\\nAfter examining this community of walruses, I decided to return in my\\ntracks. It was eleven o’clock, and if Captain Nemo found conditions\\nfavorable for taking his sights, I wanted to be present at the\\noperation. But I held no hopes that the sun would make an appearance\\nthat day. It was hidden from our eyes by clouds squeezed together on\\nthe horizon. Apparently the jealous orb didn’t want to reveal this\\ninaccessible spot on the globe to any human being.\\n\\nYet I decided to return to the Nautilus. We went along a steep, narrow\\npath that ran over the cliff’s summit. By 11:30 we had arrived at our\\nlanding place. The beached skiff had brought the captain ashore. I\\nspotted him standing on a chunk of basalt. His instruments were beside\\nhim. His eyes were focused on the northern horizon, along which the\\nsun was sweeping in its extended arc.\\n\\nI found a place near him and waited without speaking. Noon arrived,\\nand just as on the day before, the sun didn’t put in an appearance.\\n\\nIt was sheer bad luck. Our noon sights were still lacking. If we\\ncouldn’t obtain them tomorrow, we would finally have to give up any\\nhope of fixing our position.\\n\\nIn essence, it was precisely March 20. Tomorrow, the 21st, was the day\\nof the equinox; the sun would disappear below the horizon for six\\nmonths not counting refraction, and after its disappearance the long\\npolar night would begin. Following the September equinox, the sun had\\nemerged above the northerly horizon, rising in long spirals until\\nDecember 21. At that time, the summer solstice of these southernmost\\ndistricts, the sun had started back down, and tomorrow it would cast\\nits last rays.\\n\\nI shared my thoughts and fears with Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“You’re right, Professor Aronnax,” he told me. “If I can’t take the\\nsun’s altitude tomorrow, I won’t be able to try again for another six\\nmonths. But precisely because sailors’ luck has led me into these seas\\non March 21, it will be easy to get our bearings if the noonday sun\\ndoes appear before our eyes.”\\n\\n“Why easy, captain?”\\n\\n“Because when the orb of day sweeps in such long spirals, it’s\\ndifficult to measure its exact altitude above the horizon, and our\\ninstruments are open to committing serious errors.”\\n\\n“Then what can you do?”\\n\\n“I use only my chronometer,” Captain Nemo answered me. “At noon\\ntomorrow, March 21, if, after accounting for refraction, the sun’s\\ndisk is cut exactly in half by the northern horizon, that will mean\\nI’m at the South Pole.”\\n\\n“Right,” I said. “Nevertheless, it isn’t mathematically exact proof,\\nbecause the equinox needn’t fall precisely at noon.”\\n\\n“No doubt, sir, but the error will be under 100 meters, and that’s\\nclose enough for us. Until tomorrow then.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo went back on board. Conseil and I stayed behind until\\nfive o’clock, surveying the beach, observing and studying. The only\\nunusual object I picked up was an auk’s egg of remarkable size, for\\nwhich a collector would have paid more than 1,000 francs. Its\\ncream-colored tint, plus the streaks and markings that decorated it\\nlike so many hieroglyphics, made it a rare trinket. I placed it in\\nConseil’s hands, and holding it like precious porcelain from China,\\nthat cautious, sure-footed lad got it back to the Nautilus in one\\npiece.\\n\\nThere I put this rare egg inside one of the glass cases in the\\nmuseum. I ate supper, feasting with appetite on an excellent piece of\\nseal liver whose flavor reminded me of pork. Then I went to bed; but\\nnot without praying, like a good Hindu, for the favors of the radiant\\norb.\\n\\nThe next day, March 21, bright and early at five o’clock in the\\nmorning, I climbed onto the platform. I found Captain Nemo there.\\n\\n“The weather is clearing a bit,” he told me. “I have high hopes. After\\nbreakfast we’ll make our way ashore and choose an observation post.”\\n\\nThis issue settled, I went to find Ned Land. I wanted to take him with\\nme. The obstinate Canadian refused, and I could clearly see that his\\ntight-lipped mood and his bad temper were growing by the day. Under\\nthe circumstances I ultimately wasn’t sorry that he refused. In truth,\\nthere were too many seals ashore, and it would never do to expose this\\nimpulsive fisherman to such temptations.\\n\\nBreakfast over, I made my way ashore. The Nautilus had gone a few more\\nmiles during the night. It lay well out, a good league from the coast,\\nwhich was crowned by a sharp peak 400 to 500 meters high. In addition\\nto me, the skiff carried Captain Nemo, two crewmen, and the\\ninstruments—in other words, a chronometer, a spyglass, and a\\nbarometer.\\n\\nDuring our crossing I saw numerous baleen whales belonging to the\\nthree species unique to these southernmost seas: the bowhead whale (or\\n“right whale,” according to the English), which has no dorsal fin; the\\nhumpback whale from the genus Balaenoptera (in other words, “winged\\nwhales”), beasts with wrinkled bellies and huge whitish fins that,\\ngenus name regardless, do not yet form wings; and the finback whale,\\nyellowish brown, the swiftest of all cetaceans. This powerful animal\\nis audible from far away when it sends up towering spouts of air and\\nsteam that resemble swirls of smoke. Herds of these different mammals\\nwere playing about in the tranquil waters, and I could easily see that\\nthis Antarctic polar basin now served as a refuge for those cetaceans\\ntoo relentlessly pursued by hunters.\\n\\nI also noted long, whitish strings of salps, a type of mollusk found\\nin clusters, and some jellyfish of large size that swayed in the\\neddies of the billows.\\n\\nBy nine o’clock we had pulled up to shore. The sky was growing\\nbrighter. Clouds were fleeing to the south. Mists were rising from the\\ncold surface of the water. Captain Nemo headed toward the peak, which\\nhe no doubt planned to make his observatory. It was an arduous climb\\nover sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking\\nwith sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes. For a man out of practice\\nat treading land, the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple\\nagility I couldn’t equal, and which would have been envied by hunters\\nof Pyrenees mountain goats.\\n\\nIt took us two hours to reach the summit of this half-crystal,\\nhalf-basalt peak. From there our eyes scanned a vast sea, which\\nscrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the\\nnorthern sky. At our feet: dazzling tracts of white. Over our heads: a\\npale azure, clear of mists. North of us: the sun’s disk, like a ball\\nof fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon. From the heart of\\nthe waters: jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent\\nbouquets. Far off, like a sleeping cetacean: the Nautilus. Behind us\\nto the south and east: an immense shore, a chaotic heap of rocks and\\nice whose limits we couldn’t see.\\n\\nArriving at the summit of this peak, Captain Nemo carefully determined\\nits elevation by means of his barometer, since he had to take this\\nfactor into account in his noon sights.\\n\\nAt 11:45 the sun, by then seen only by refraction, looked like a\\ngolden disk, dispersing its last rays over this deserted continent and\\ndown to these seas not yet plowed by the ships of man.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo had brought a spyglass with a reticular eyepiece, which\\ncorrected the sun’s refraction by means of a mirror, and he used it to\\nobserve the orb sinking little by little along a very extended\\ndiagonal that reached below the horizon. I held the chronometer. My\\nheart was pounding mightily. If the lower half of the sun’s disk\\ndisappeared just as the chronometer said noon, we were right at the\\npole.\\n\\n“Noon!” I called.\\n\\n“The South Pole!” Captain Nemo replied in a solemn voice, handing me\\nthe spyglass, which showed the orb of day cut into two exactly equal\\nparts by the horizon.\\n\\nI stared at the last rays wreathing this peak, while shadows were\\ngradually climbing its gradients.\\n\\nJust then, resting his hand on my shoulder, Captain Nemo said to me:\\n\\n“In 1600, sir, the Dutchman Gheritk was swept by storms and currents,\\nreaching latitude 64 degrees south and discovering the South Shetland\\nIslands. On January 17, 1773, the famous Captain Cook went along the\\n38th meridian, arriving at latitude 67 degrees 30’; and on January 30,\\n1774, along the 109th meridian, he reached latitude 71 degrees 15’. In\\n1819 the Russian Bellinghausen lay on the 69th parallel, and in 1821\\non the 66th at longitude 111 degrees west. In 1820 the Englishman\\nBransfield stopped at 65 degrees. That same year the American Morrel,\\nwhose reports are dubious, went along the 42nd meridian, finding open\\nsea at latitude 70 degrees 14’. In 1825 the Englishman Powell was\\nunable to get beyond 62 degrees. That same year a humble seal\\nfisherman, the Englishman Weddell, went as far as latitude 72 degrees\\n14’ on the 35th meridian, and as far as 74 degrees 15’ on the 36th. In\\n1829 the Englishman Forster, commander of the Chanticleer, laid claim\\nto the Antarctic continent in latitude 63 degrees 26’ and longitude 66\\ndegrees 26’. On February 1, 1831, the Englishman Biscoe discovered\\nEnderby Land at latitude 68 degrees 50’, Adelaide Land at latitude 67\\ndegrees on February 5, 1832, and Graham Land at latitude 64 degrees\\n45’ on February 21. In 1838 the Frenchman Dumont d’Urville stopped at\\nthe Ice Bank in latitude 62 degrees 57’, sighting the Louis-Philippe\\nPeninsula; on January 21 two years later, at a new southerly position\\nof 66 degrees 30’, he named the Adélie Coast and eight days later, the\\nClarie Coast at 64 degrees 40’. In 1838 the American Wilkes advanced\\nas far as the 69th parallel on the 100th meridian. In 1839 the\\nEnglishman Balleny discovered the Sabrina Coast at the edge of the\\npolar circle. Lastly, on January 12, 1842, with his ships, the Erebus\\nand the Terror, the Englishman Sir James Clark Ross found Victoria\\nLand in latitude 70 degrees 56’ and longitude 171 degrees 7’ east; on\\nthe 23rd of that same month, he reached the 74th parallel, a position\\ndenoting the Farthest South attained until then; on the 27th he lay at\\n76 degrees 8’; on the 28th at 77 degrees 32’; on February 2 at 78\\ndegrees 4’; and late in 1842 he returned to 71 degrees but couldn’t\\nget beyond it. Well now! In 1868, on this 21st day of March, I myself,\\nCaptain Nemo, have reached the South Pole at 90 degrees, and I hereby\\nclaim this entire part of the globe, equal to one-sixth of the known\\ncontinents.”\\n\\n“In the name of which sovereign, captain?”\\n\\n“In my own name, sir!”\\n\\nSo saying, Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag bearing a gold “N” on\\nits quartered bunting. Then, turning toward the orb of day, whose last\\nrays were licking at the sea’s horizon:\\n\\n“Farewell, O sun!” he called. “Disappear, O radiant orb! Retire\\nbeneath this open sea, and let six months of night spread their\\nshadows over my new domains!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\nAccident or Incident?\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY, March 22, at six o’clock in the morning, preparations\\nfor departure began. The last gleams of twilight were melting into\\nnight. The cold was brisk. The constellations were glittering with\\nstartling intensity. The wonderful Southern Cross, polar star of the\\nAntarctic regions, twinkled at its zenith.\\n\\nThe thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade, and a fresh breeze left\\na sharp nip in the air. Ice floes were increasing over the open\\nwater. The sea was starting to congeal everywhere. Numerous blackish\\npatches were spreading over its surface, announcing the imminent\\nformation of fresh ice. Obviously this southernmost basin froze over\\nduring its six-month winter and became utterly inaccessible. What\\nhappened to the whales during this period? No doubt they went beneath\\nthe Ice Bank to find more feasible seas. As for seals and walruses,\\nthey were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on\\nin these icy waterways. These animals know by instinct how to gouge\\nholes in the ice fields and keep them continually open; they go to\\nthese holes to breathe. Once the birds have migrated northward to\\nescape the cold, these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the\\npolar continent.\\n\\nMeanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the Nautilus sank\\nslowly. At a depth of 1,000 feet, it stopped. Its propeller churned\\nthe waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per\\nhour. Near the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense\\nfrozen carapace of the Ice Bank.\\n\\nAs a precaution, the panels in the lounge stayed closed, because the\\nNautilus’s hull could run afoul of some submerged block of ice. So I\\nspent the day putting my notes into final form. My mind was completely\\nwrapped up in my memories of the pole. We had reached that\\ninaccessible spot without facing exhaustion or danger, as if our\\nseagoing passenger carriage had glided there on railroad tracks. And\\nnow we had actually started our return journey. Did it still have\\ncomparable surprises in store for me? I felt sure it did, so\\ninexhaustible is this series of underwater wonders! As it was, in the\\nfive and a half months since fate had brought us on board, we had\\ncleared 14,000 leagues, and over this track longer than the earth’s\\nequator, so many fascinating or frightening incidents had beguiled our\\nvoyage: that hunting trip in the Crespo forests, our running aground\\nin the Torres Strait, the coral cemetery, the pearl fisheries of\\nCeylon, the Arabic tunnel, the fires of Santorini, those millions in\\nthe Bay of Vigo, Atlantis, the South Pole! During the night all these\\nmemories crossed over from one dream to the next, not giving my brain\\na moment’s rest.\\n\\nAt three o’clock in the morning, I was awakened by a violent\\ncollision. I sat up in bed, listening in the darkness, and then was\\nsuddenly hurled into the middle of my stateroom. Apparently the\\nNautilus had gone aground, then heeled over sharply.\\n\\nLeaning against the walls, I dragged myself down the gangways to the\\nlounge, whose ceiling lights were on. The furniture had been knocked\\nover. Fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and\\nhad stood fast. Since we were no longer vertical, the starboard\\npictures were glued to the tapestries, while those to port had their\\nlower edges hanging a foot away from the wall. So the Nautilus was\\nlying on its starboard side, completely stationary to boot.\\n\\nIn its interior I heard the sound of footsteps and muffled voices. But\\nCaptain Nemo didn’t appear. Just as I was about to leave the lounge,\\nNed Land and Conseil entered.\\n\\n“What happened?” I instantly said to them.\\n\\n“I came to ask master that,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Damnation!” the Canadian exclaimed. “I know full well what happened!\\nThe Nautilus has gone aground, and judging from the way it’s listing,\\nI don’t think it’ll pull through like that first time in the Torres\\nStrait.”\\n\\n“But,” I asked, “are we at least back on the surface of the sea?”\\n\\n“We have no idea,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“It’s easy to find out,” I answered.\\n\\nI consulted the pressure gauge. Much to my surprise, it indicated a\\ndepth of 360 meters.\\n\\n“What’s the meaning of this?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“We must confer with Captain Nemo,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“But where do we find him?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\n“Follow me,” I told my two companions.\\n\\nWe left the lounge. Nobody in the library. Nobody by the central\\ncompanionway or the crew’s quarters. I assumed that Captain Nemo was\\nstationed in the pilothouse. Best to wait. The three of us returned to\\nthe lounge.\\n\\nI’ll skip over the Canadian’s complaints. He had good grounds for an\\noutburst. I didn’t answer him back, letting him blow off all the steam\\nhe wanted.\\n\\nWe had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes, trying to detect the\\ntiniest noises inside the Nautilus, when Captain Nemo entered. He\\ndidn’t seem to see us. His facial features, usually so emotionless,\\nrevealed a certain uneasiness. He studied the compass and pressure\\ngauge in silence, then went and put his finger on the world map at a\\nspot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas.\\n\\nI hesitated to interrupt him. But some moments later, when he turned\\nto me, I threw back at him a phrase he had used in the Torres Strait:\\n\\n“An incident, captain?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” he replied, “this time an accident.”\\n\\n“Serious?”\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“Is there any immediate danger?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“The Nautilus has run aground?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And this accident came about . . . ?”\\n\\n“Through nature’s unpredictability not man’s incapacity. No errors\\nwere committed in our maneuvers. Nevertheless, we can’t prevent a loss\\nof balance from taking its toll. One may defy human laws, but no one\\ncan withstand the laws of nature.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo had picked an odd time to philosophize. All in all, this\\nreply told me nothing.\\n\\n“May I learn, sir,” I asked him, “what caused this accident?”\\n\\n“An enormous block of ice, an entire mountain, has toppled over,” he\\nanswered me. “When an iceberg is eroded at the base by warmer waters\\nor by repeated collisions, its center of gravity rises. Then it\\nsomersaults, it turns completely upside down. That’s what happened\\nhere. When it overturned, one of these blocks hit the Nautilus as it\\nwas cruising under the waters. Sliding under our hull, this block then\\nraised us with irresistible power, lifting us into less congested\\nstrata where we now lie on our side.”\\n\\n“But can’t we float the Nautilus clear by emptying its ballast tanks,\\nto regain our balance?”\\n\\n“That, sir, is being done right now. You can hear the pumps\\nworking. Look at the needle on the pressure gauge. It indicates that\\nthe Nautilus is rising, but this block of ice is rising with us, and\\nuntil some obstacle halts its upward movement, our position won’t\\nchange.”\\n\\nIndeed, the Nautilus kept the same heel to starboard. No doubt it\\nwould straighten up once the block came to a halt. But before that\\nhappened, who knew if we might not hit the underbelly of the Ice Bank\\nand be hideously squeezed between two frozen surfaces?\\n\\nI mused on all the consequences of this situation. Captain Nemo didn’t\\nstop studying the pressure gauge. Since the toppling of this iceberg,\\nthe Nautilus had risen about 150 feet, but it still stayed at the same\\nangle to the perpendicular.\\n\\nSuddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull. Obviously the\\nNautilus was straightening a bit. Objects hanging in the lounge were\\nvisibly returning to their normal positions. The walls were\\napproaching the vertical. Nobody said a word. Hearts pounding, we\\ncould see and feel the ship righting itself. The floor was becoming\\nhorizontal beneath our feet. Ten minutes went by.\\n\\n“Finally, we’re upright!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes,” Captain Nemo said, heading to the lounge door.\\n\\n“But will we float off?” I asked him.\\n\\n“Certainly,” he replied, “since the ballast tanks aren’t yet empty,\\nand when they are, the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea.”\\n\\nThe captain went out, and soon I saw that at his orders, the Nautilus\\nhad halted its upward movement. In fact, it soon would have hit the\\nunderbelly of the Ice Bank, but it had stopped in time and was\\nfloating in midwater.\\n\\n“That was a close call!” Conseil then said.\\n\\n“Yes. We could have been crushed between these masses of ice, or at\\nleast imprisoned between them. And then, with no way to renew our air\\nsupply. . . . Yes, that was a close call!”\\n\\n“If it’s over with!” Ned Land muttered.\\n\\nI was unwilling to get into a pointless argument with the Canadian and\\ndidn’t reply. Moreover, the panels opened just then, and the outside\\nlight burst through the uncovered windows.\\n\\nWe were fully afloat, as I have said; but on both sides of the\\nNautilus, about ten meters away, there rose dazzling walls of\\nice. There also were walls above and below. Above, because the Ice\\nBank’s underbelly spread over us like an immense ceiling. Below,\\nbecause the somersaulting block, shifting little by little, had found\\npoints of purchase on both side walls and had gotten jammed between\\nthem. The Nautilus was imprisoned in a genuine tunnel of ice about\\ntwenty meters wide and filled with quiet water. So the ship could\\neasily exit by going either ahead or astern, sinking a few hundred\\nmeters deeper, and then taking an open passageway beneath the Ice\\nBank.\\n\\nThe ceiling lights were off, yet the lounge was still brightly\\nlit. This was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice, which\\nthrew the beams of our beacon right back at us. Words cannot describe\\nthe effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge, whimsically\\nsculpted blocks, whose every angle, ridge, and facet gave off a\\ndifferent glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the\\nice. It was a dazzling mine of gems, in particular sapphires and\\nemeralds, whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed. Here and there,\\nopaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that\\nwere like so many fiery diamonds, their brilliance more than any eye\\ncould stand. The power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold, like\\na lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world-class\\nlighthouse.\\n\\n“How beautiful!” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “it’s a wonderful sight! Isn’t it, Ned?”\\n\\n“Oh damnation, yes!” Ned Land shot back. “It’s superb! I’m furious\\nthat I have to admit it. Nobody has ever seen the like. But this sight\\ncould cost us dearly. And in all honesty, I think we’re looking at\\nthings God never intended for human eyes.”\\n\\nNed was right. It was too beautiful. All at once a yell from Conseil\\nmade me turn around.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked.\\n\\n“Master must close his eyes! Master mustn’t look!”\\n\\nWith that, Conseil clapped his hands over his eyes.\\n\\n“But what’s wrong, my boy?”\\n\\n“I’ve been dazzled, struck blind!”\\n\\nInvoluntarily my eyes flew to the window, but I couldn’t stand the\\nfire devouring it.\\n\\nI realized what had happened. The Nautilus had just started off at\\ngreat speed. All the tranquil glimmers of the ice walls had then\\nchanged into blazing streaks. The sparkles from these myriads of\\ndiamonds were merging with each other. Swept along by its propeller,\\nthe Nautilus was traveling through a sheath of flashing light.\\n\\nThen the panels in the lounge closed. We kept our hands over our eyes,\\nwhich were utterly saturated with those concentric gleams that swirl\\nbefore the retina when sunlight strikes it too intensely. It took some\\ntime to calm our troubled vision.\\n\\nFinally we lowered our hands.\\n\\n“Ye gods, I never would have believed it,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“And I still don’t believe it!” the Canadian shot back.\\n\\n“When we return to shore, jaded from all these natural wonders,”\\nConseil added, “think how we’ll look down on those pitiful land\\nmasses, those puny works of man! No, the civilized world won’t be good\\nenough for us!”\\n\\nSuch words from the lips of this emotionless Flemish boy showed that\\nour enthusiasm was near the boiling point. But the Canadian didn’t\\nfail to throw his dram of cold water over us.\\n\\n“The civilized world!” he said, shaking his head. “Don’t worry,\\nConseil my friend, we’re never going back to that world!”\\n\\nBy this point it was five o’clock in the morning. Just then there was\\na collision in the Nautilus’s bow. I realized that its spur had just\\nbumped a block of ice. It must have been a faulty maneuver because\\nthis underwater tunnel was obstructed by such blocks and didn’t make\\nfor easy navigating. So I had assumed that Captain Nemo, in adjusting\\nhis course, would go around each obstacle or would hug the walls and\\nfollow the windings of the tunnel. In either case our forward motion\\nwouldn’t receive an absolute check. Nevertheless, contrary to my\\nexpectations, the Nautilus definitely began to move backward.\\n\\n“We’re going astern?” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied. “Apparently the tunnel has no way out at this end.”\\n\\n“And so . . . ?”\\n\\n“So,” I said, “our maneuvers are quite simple. We’ll return in our\\ntracks and go out the southern opening. That’s all.”\\n\\nAs I spoke, I tried to sound more confident than I really\\nfelt. Meanwhile the Nautilus accelerated its backward movement, and\\nrunning with propeller in reverse, it swept us along at great speed.\\n\\n“This’ll mean a delay,” Ned said.\\n\\n“What are a few hours more or less, so long as we get out.”\\n\\n“Yes,” Ned Land repeated, “so long as we get out!”\\n\\nI strolled for a little while from the lounge into the library. My\\ncompanions kept their seats and didn’t move. Soon I threw myself down\\non a couch and picked up a book, which my eyes skimmed mechanically.\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later, Conseil approached me, saying:\\n\\n“Is it deeply fascinating, this volume master is reading?”\\n\\n“Tremendously fascinating,” I replied.\\n\\n“I believe it. Master is reading his own book!”\\n\\n“My own book?”\\n\\nIndeed, my hands were holding my own work on the great ocean depths. I\\nhadn’t even suspected. I closed the book and resumed my strolling. Ned\\nand Conseil stood up to leave.\\n\\n“Stay here, my friends,” I said, stopping them. “Let’s stay together\\nuntil we’re out of this blind alley.”\\n\\n“As master wishes,” Conseil replied.\\n\\nThe hours passed. I often studied the instruments hanging on the\\nlounge wall. The pressure gauge indicated that the Nautilus stayed at\\na constant depth of 300 meters, the compass that it kept heading\\nsouth, the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty miles per\\nhour, an excessive speed in such a cramped area. But Captain Nemo knew\\nthat by this point there was no such thing as too fast, since minutes\\nwere now worth centuries.\\n\\nAt 8:25 a second collision took place. This time astern. I grew\\npale. My companions came over. I clutched Conseil’s hand. Our eyes\\nquestioned each other, and more directly than if our thoughts had been\\ntranslated into words.\\n\\nJust then the captain entered the lounge. I went to him.\\n\\n“Our path is barred to the south?” I asked him.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. When it overturned, that iceberg closed off every exit.”\\n\\n“We’re boxed in?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\nShortage of Air\\n\\n\\nCONSEQUENTLY, above, below, and around the Nautilus, there were\\nimpenetrable frozen walls. We were the Ice Bank’s prisoners! The\\nCanadian banged a table with his fearsome fist. Conseil kept still. I\\nstared at the captain. His face had resumed its usual\\nemotionlessness. He crossed his arms. He pondered. The Nautilus did\\nnot stir.\\n\\nThe captain then broke into speech:\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” he said in a calm voice, “there are two ways of dying\\nunder the conditions in which we’re placed.”\\n\\nThis inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor\\nworking out a problem for his pupils.\\n\\n“The first way,” he went on, “is death by crushing. The second is\\ndeath by asphyxiation. I don’t mention the possibility of death by\\nstarvation because the Nautilus’s provisions will certainly last\\nlonger than we will. Therefore, let’s concentrate on our chances of\\nbeing crushed or asphyxiated.”\\n\\n“As for asphyxiation, captain,” I replied, “that isn’t a cause for\\nalarm, because the air tanks are full.”\\n\\n“True,” Captain Nemo went on, “but they’ll supply air for only two\\ndays. Now then, we’ve been buried beneath the waters for thirty-six\\nhours, and the Nautilus’s heavy atmosphere already needs renewing. In\\nanother forty-eight hours, our reserve air will be used up.”\\n\\n“Well then, captain, let’s free ourselves within forty-eight hours!”\\n\\n“We’ll try to at least, by cutting through one of these walls\\nsurrounding us.”\\n\\n“Which one?” I asked.\\n\\n“Borings will tell us that. I’m going to ground the Nautilus on the\\nlower shelf, then my men will put on their diving suits and attack the\\nthinnest of these ice walls.”\\n\\n“Can the panels in the lounge be left open?”\\n\\n“Without ill effect. We’re no longer in motion.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo went out. Hissing sounds soon told me that water was\\nbeing admitted into the ballast tanks. The Nautilus slowly settled and\\nrested on the icy bottom at a depth of 350 meters, the depth at which\\nthe lower shelf of ice lay submerged.\\n\\n“My friends,” I said, “we’re in a serious predicament, but I’m\\ncounting on your courage and energy.”\\n\\n“Sir,” the Canadian replied, “this is no time to bore you with my\\ncomplaints. I’m ready to do anything I can for the common good.”\\n\\n“Excellent, Ned,” I said, extending my hand to the Canadian.\\n\\n“I might add,” he went on, “that I’m as handy with a pick as a\\nharpoon. If I can be helpful to the captain, he can use me any way he\\nwants.”\\n\\n“He won’t turn down your assistance. Come along, Ned.”\\n\\nI led the Canadian to the room where the Nautilus’s men were putting\\non their diving suits. I informed the captain of Ned’s proposition,\\nwhich was promptly accepted. The Canadian got into his underwater\\ncostume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers. Each of them\\ncarried on his back a Rouquayrol device that the air tanks had\\nsupplied with a generous allowance of fresh oxygen. A considerable but\\nnecessary drain on the Nautilus’s reserves. As for the Ruhmkorff\\nlamps, they were unnecessary in the midst of these brilliant waters\\nsaturated with our electric rays.\\n\\nAfter Ned was dressed, I reentered the lounge, whose windows had been\\nuncovered; stationed next to Conseil, I examined the strata\\nsurrounding and supporting the Nautilus.\\n\\nSome moments later, we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of\\nice, among them Ned Land, easily recognized by his tall\\nfigure. Captain Nemo was with them.\\n\\nBefore digging into the ice, the captain had to obtain borings, to\\ninsure working in the best direction. Long bores were driven into the\\nside walls; but after fifteen meters, the instruments were still\\nimpeded by the thickness of those walls. It was futile to attack the\\nceiling since that surface was the Ice Bank itself, more than 400\\nmeters high. Captain Nemo then bored into the lower surface. There we\\nwere separated from the sea by a ten-meter barrier. That’s how thick\\nthe iceberg was. From this point on, it was an issue of cutting out a\\npiece equal in surface area to the Nautilus’s waterline. This meant\\ndetaching about 6,500 cubic meters, to dig a hole through which the\\nship could descend below this tract of ice.\\n\\nWork began immediately and was carried on with tireless\\ntenacity. Instead of digging all around the Nautilus, which would have\\nentailed even greater difficulties, Captain Nemo had an immense trench\\noutlined on the ice, eight meters from our port quarter. Then his men\\nsimultaneously staked it off at several points around its\\ncircumference. Soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact\\nmatter, and huge chunks were loosened from its mass. These chunks\\nweighed less than the water, and by an unusual effect of specific\\ngravity, each chunk took wing, as it were, to the roof of the tunnel,\\nwhich thickened above by as much as it diminished below. But this\\nhardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner.\\n\\nAfter two hours of energetic work, Ned Land reentered, exhausted. He\\nand his companions were replaced by new workmen, including Conseil and\\nme. The Nautilus’s chief officer supervised us.\\n\\nThe water struck me as unusually cold, but I warmed up promptly while\\nwielding my pick. My movements were quite free, although they were\\nexecuted under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.\\n\\nAfter two hours of work, reentering to snatch some food and rest, I\\nfound a noticeable difference between the clean elastic fluid supplied\\nme by the Rouquayrol device and the Nautilus’s atmosphere, which was\\nalready charged with carbon dioxide. The air hadn’t been renewed in\\nforty-eight hours, and its life-giving qualities were considerably\\nweakened. Meanwhile, after twelve hours had gone by, we had removed\\nfrom the outlined surface area a slice of ice only one meter thick,\\nhence about 600 cubic meters. Assuming the same work would be\\naccomplished every twelve hours, it would still take five nights and\\nfour days to see the undertaking through to completion.\\n\\n“Five nights and four days!” I told my companions. “And we have oxygen\\nin the air tanks for only two days.”\\n\\n“Without taking into account,” Ned answered, “that once we’re out of\\nthis damned prison, we’ll still be cooped up beneath the Ice Bank,\\nwithout any possible contact with the open air!”\\n\\nAn apt remark. For who could predict the minimum time we would need to\\nfree ourselves? Before the Nautilus could return to the surface of the\\nwaves, couldn’t we all die of asphyxiation? Were this ship and\\neveryone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice? It was a\\ndreadful state of affairs. But we faced it head-on, each one of us\\ndetermined to do his duty to the end.\\n\\nDuring the night, in line with my forecasts, a new one-meter slice was\\nremoved from this immense socket. But in the morning, wearing my\\ndiving suit, I was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature\\nof -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade, when I noted that little by\\nlittle the side walls were closing in on each other. The liquid strata\\nfarthest from the trench, not warmed by the movements of workmen and\\ntools, were showing a tendency to solidify. In the face of this\\nimminent new danger, what would happen to our chances for salvation,\\nand how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying, then\\ncracking the Nautilus’s hull like glass?\\n\\nI didn’t tell my two companions about this new danger. There was no\\npoint in dampening the energy they were putting into our arduous\\nrescue work. But when I returned on board, I mentioned this serious\\ncomplication to Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“I know,” he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook\\ncouldn’t change. “It’s one more danger, but I don’t know any way of\\nwarding it off. Our sole chance for salvation is to work faster than\\nthe water solidifies. We’ve got to get there first, that’s all.”\\n\\nGet there first! By then I should have been used to this type of talk!\\n\\nFor several hours that day, I wielded my pick doggedly. The work kept\\nme going. Besides, working meant leaving the Nautilus, which meant\\nbreathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks and supplied by\\nour equipment, which meant leaving the thin, foul air behind.\\n\\nNear evening one more meter had been dug from the trench. When I\\nreturned on board, I was wellnigh asphyxiated by the carbon dioxide\\nsaturating the air. Oh, if only we had the chemical methods that would\\nenable us to drive out this noxious gas! There was no lack of\\noxygen. All this water contained a considerable amount, and after it\\nwas decomposed by our powerful batteries, this life-giving elastic\\nfluid could have been restored to us. I had thought it all out, but to\\nno avail because the carbon dioxide produced by our breathing\\npermeated every part of the ship. To absorb it, we would need to fill\\ncontainers with potassium hydroxide and shake them continually. But\\nthis substance was missing on board and nothing else could replace it.\\n\\nThat evening Captain Nemo was forced to open the spigots of his air\\ntanks and shoot a few spouts of fresh oxygen through the Nautilus’s\\ninterior. Without this precaution we wouldn’t have awakened the\\nfollowing morning.\\n\\nThe next day, March 26, I returned to my miner’s trade, working to\\nremove the fifth meter. The Ice Bank’s side walls and underbelly had\\nvisibly thickened. Obviously they would come together before the\\nNautilus could break free. For an instant I was gripped by despair. My\\npick nearly slipped from my hands. What was the point of this digging\\nif I was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone,\\na torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages! I felt like I was\\nlying in the jaws of a fearsome monster, jaws irresistibly closing.\\n\\nSupervising our work, working himself, Captain Nemo passed near me\\njust then. I touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls of our\\nprison. The starboard wall had moved forward to a point less than four\\nmeters from the Nautilus’s hull.\\n\\nThe captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him. We returned\\non board. My diving suit removed, I went with him to the lounge.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he told me, “this calls for heroic measures, or\\nwe’ll be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement.”\\n\\n“Yes!” I said. “But what can we do?”\\n\\n“Oh,” he exclaimed, “if only my Nautilus were strong enough to stand\\nthat much pressure without being crushed!”\\n\\n“Well?” I asked, not catching the captain’s meaning.\\n\\n“Don’t you understand,” he went on, “that the congealing of this water\\ncould come to our rescue? Don’t you see that by solidifying, it could\\nburst these tracts of ice imprisoning us, just as its freezing can\\nburst the hardest stones? Aren’t you aware that this force could be\\nthe instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain, maybe so. But whatever resistance to crushing the\\nNautilus may have, it still couldn’t stand such dreadful pressures,\\nand it would be squashed as flat as a piece of sheet iron.”\\n\\n“I know it, sir. So we can’t rely on nature to rescue us, only our own\\nefforts. We must counteract this solidification. We must hold it in\\ncheck. Not only are the side walls closing in, but there aren’t ten\\nfeet of water ahead or astern of the Nautilus. All around us, this\\nfreeze is gaining fast.”\\n\\n“How long,” I asked, “will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us to\\nbreathe on board?”\\n\\nThe captain looked me straight in the eye.\\n\\n“After tomorrow,” he said, “the air tanks will be empty!”\\n\\nI broke out in a cold sweat. But why should I have been startled by\\nthis reply? On March 22 the Nautilus had dived under the open waters\\nat the pole. It was now the 26th. We had lived off the ship’s stores\\nfor five days! And all remaining breathable air had to be saved for\\nthe workmen. Even today as I write these lines, my sensations are so\\nintense that an involuntary terror sweeps over me, and my lungs still\\nseem short of air!\\n\\nMeanwhile, motionless and silent, Captain Nemo stood lost in\\nthought. An idea visibly crossed his mind. But he seemed to brush it\\naside. He told himself no. At last these words escaped his lips:\\n\\n“Boiling water!” he muttered.\\n\\n“Boiling water?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. We’re shut up in a relatively confined area. If the\\nNautilus’s pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into\\nthis space, wouldn’t that raise its temperature and delay its\\nfreezing?”\\n\\n“It’s worth trying!” I said resolutely.\\n\\n“So let’s try it, professor.”\\n\\nBy then the thermometer gave -7 degrees centigrade outside. Captain\\nNemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling mechanism was at\\nwork, supplying drinking water via evaporation. The mechanism was\\nloaded with water, and the full electric heat of our batteries was\\nthrown into coils awash in liquid. In a few minutes the water reached\\n100 degrees centigrade. It was sent to the pumps while new water\\nreplaced it in the process. The heat generated by our batteries was so\\nintense that after simply going through the mechanism, water drawn\\ncold from the sea arrived boiling hot at the body of the pump.\\n\\nThe steaming water was injected into the icy water outside, and after\\nthree hours had passed, the thermometer gave the exterior temperature\\nas -6 degrees centigrade. That was one degree gained. Two hours later\\nthe thermometer gave only -4 degrees.\\n\\nAfter I monitored the operation’s progress, double-checking it with\\nmany inspections, I told the captain, “It’s working.”\\n\\n“I think so,” he answered me. “We’ve escaped being crushed. Now we\\nhave only asphyxiation to fear.”\\n\\nDuring the night the water temperature rose to -1 degrees\\ncentigrade. The injections couldn’t get it to go a single degree\\nhigher. But since salt water freezes only at -2 degrees, I was finally\\nassured that there was no danger of it solidifying.\\n\\nBy the next day, March 27, six meters of ice had been torn from the\\nsocket. Only four meters were left to be removed. That still meant\\nforty-eight hours of work. The air couldn’t be renewed in the\\nNautilus’s interior. Accordingly, that day it kept getting worse.\\n\\nAn unbearable heaviness weighed me down. Near three o’clock in the\\nafternoon, this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense\\ndegree. Yawns dislocated my jaws. My lungs were gasping in their quest\\nfor that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing, now growing\\nscarcer and scarcer. My mind was in a daze. I lay outstretched,\\nstrength gone, nearly unconscious. My gallant Conseil felt the same\\nsymptoms, suffered the same sufferings, yet never left my side. He\\nheld my hand, he kept encouraging me, and I even heard him mutter:\\n\\n“Oh, if only I didn’t have to breathe, to leave more air for master!”\\n\\nIt brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words.\\n\\nSince conditions inside were universally unbearable, how eagerly, how\\nhappily, we put on our diving suits to take our turns working! Picks\\nrang out on that bed of ice. Arms grew weary, hands were rubbed raw,\\nbut who cared about exhaustion, what difference were wounds?\\nLife-sustaining air reached our lungs! We could breathe! We could\\nbreathe!\\n\\nAnd yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time allotted\\nhim. His shift over, each man surrendered to a gasping companion the\\nair tank that would revive him. Captain Nemo set the example and was\\nforemost in submitting to this strict discipline. When his time was\\nup, he yielded his equipment to another and reentered the foul air on\\nboard, always calm, unflinching, and uncomplaining.\\n\\nThat day the usual work was accomplished with even greater\\nenergy. Over the whole surface area, only two meters were left to be\\nremoved. Only two meters separated us from the open sea. But the\\nship’s air tanks were nearly empty. The little air that remained had\\nto be saved for the workmen. Not an atom for the Nautilus!\\n\\nWhen I returned on board, I felt half suffocated. What a night! I’m\\nunable to depict it. Such sufferings are indescribable. The next day I\\nwas short-winded. Headaches and staggering fits of dizziness made me\\nreel like a drunk. My companions were experiencing the same\\nsymptoms. Some crewmen were at their last gasp.\\n\\nThat day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo concluded that\\npicks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still\\nseparating us from open water—and he decided to crush this layer. The\\nman had kept his energy and composure. He had subdued physical pain\\nwith moral strength. He could still think, plan, and act.\\n\\nAt his orders the craft was eased off, in other words, it was raised\\nfrom its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity. When it was\\nafloat, the crew towed it, leading it right above the immense trench\\noutlined to match the ship’s waterline. Next the ballast tanks filled\\nwith water, the boat sank, and was fitted into its socket.\\n\\nJust then the whole crew returned on board, and the double outside\\ndoor was closed. By this point the Nautilus was resting on a bed of\\nice only one meter thick and drilled by bores in a thousand places.\\n\\nThe stopcocks of the ballast tanks were then opened wide, and 100\\ncubic meters of water rushed in, increasing the Nautilus’s weight by\\n100,000 kilograms.\\n\\nWe waited, we listened, we forgot our sufferings, we hoped once\\nmore. We had staked our salvation on this one last gamble.\\n\\nDespite the buzzing in my head, I soon could hear vibrations under the\\nNautilus’s hull. We tilted. The ice cracked with an odd ripping sound,\\nlike paper tearing, and the Nautilus began settling downward.\\n\\n“We’re going through!” Conseil muttered in my ear.\\n\\nI couldn’t answer him. I clutched his hand. I squeezed it in an\\ninvoluntary convulsion.\\n\\nAll at once, carried away by its frightful excess load, the Nautilus\\nsank into the waters like a cannonball, in other words, dropping as if\\nin a vacuum!\\n\\nOur full electric power was then put on the pumps, which instantly\\nbegan to expel water from the ballast tanks. After a few minutes we\\nhad checked our fall. The pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending\\nmovement. Brought to full speed, the propeller made the sheet-iron\\nhull tremble down to its rivets, and we sped northward.\\n\\nBut how long would it take to navigate under the Ice Bank to the open\\nsea? Another day? I would be dead first!\\n\\nHalf lying on a couch in the library, I was suffocating. My face was\\npurple, my lips blue, my faculties in abeyance. I could no longer see\\nor hear. I had lost all sense of time. My muscles had no power to\\ncontract.\\n\\nI’m unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way. But I was\\naware that my death throes had begun. I realized that I was about to\\ndie . . .\\n\\nSuddenly I regained consciousness. A few whiffs of air had entered my\\nlungs. Had we risen to the surface of the waves? Had we cleared the\\nIce Bank?\\n\\nNo! Ned and Conseil, my two gallant friends, were sacrificing\\nthemselves to save me. A few atoms of air were still left in the\\ndepths of one Rouquayrol device. Instead of breathing it themselves,\\nthey had saved it for me, and while they were suffocating, they poured\\nlife into me drop by drop! I tried to push the device away. They held\\nmy hands, and for a few moments I could breathe luxuriously.\\n\\nMy eyes flew toward the clock. It was eleven in the morning. It had to\\nbe March 28. The Nautilus was traveling at the frightful speed of\\nforty miles per hour. It was writhing in the waters.\\n\\nWhere was Captain Nemo? Had he perished? Had his companions died with\\nhim?\\n\\nJust then the pressure gauge indicated we were no more than twenty\\nfeet from the surface. Separating us from the open air was a mere\\ntract of ice. Could we break through it?\\n\\nPerhaps! In any event the Nautilus was going to try. In fact, I could\\nfeel it assuming an oblique position, lowering its stern and raising\\nits spur. The admission of additional water was enough to shift its\\nbalance. Then, driven by its powerful propeller, it attacked this ice\\nfield from below like a fearsome battering ram. It split the barrier\\nlittle by little, backing up, then putting on full speed against the\\npunctured tract of ice; and finally, carried away by its supreme\\nmomentum, it lunged through and onto this frozen surface, crushing the\\nice beneath its weight.\\n\\nThe hatches were opened—or torn off, if you prefer—and waves of clean\\nair were admitted into every part of the Nautilus.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\nFrom Cape Horn to the Amazon\\n\\n\\nHOW I GOT ONTO the platform I’m unable to say. Perhaps the Canadian\\ntransferred me there. But I could breathe, I could inhale the\\nlife-giving sea air. Next to me my two companions were getting tipsy\\non the fresh oxygen particles. Poor souls who have suffered from long\\nstarvation mustn’t pounce heedlessly on the first food given them. We,\\non the other hand, didn’t have to practice such moderation: we could\\nsuck the atoms from the air by the lungful, and it was the breeze, the\\nbreeze itself, that poured into us this luxurious intoxication!\\n\\n“Ahhh!” Conseil was putting in. “What fine oxygen! Let master have no\\nfears about breathing. There’s enough for everyone.”\\n\\nAs for Ned Land, he didn’t say a word, but his wide-open jaws would\\nhave scared off a shark. And what powerful inhalations! The Canadian\\n“drew” like a furnace going full blast.\\n\\nOur strength returned promptly, and when I looked around, I saw that\\nwe were alone on the platform. No crewmen. Not even Captain\\nNemo. Those strange seamen on the Nautilus were content with the\\noxygen circulating inside. Not one of them had come up to enjoy the\\nopen air.\\n\\nThe first words I pronounced were words of appreciation and gratitude\\nto my two companions. Ned and Conseil had kept me alive during the\\nfinal hours of our long death throes. But no expression of thanks\\ncould repay them fully for such devotion.\\n\\n“Good lord, professor,” Ned Land answered me, “don’t mention it! What\\ndid we do that’s so praiseworthy? Not a thing. It was a question of\\nsimple arithmetic. Your life is worth more than ours. So we had to\\nsave it.”\\n\\n“No, Ned,” I replied, “it isn’t worth more. Nobody could be better\\nthan a kind and generous man like yourself!”\\n\\n“All right, all right!” the Canadian repeated in embarrassment.\\n\\n“And you, my gallant Conseil, you suffered a great deal.”\\n\\n“Not too much, to be candid with master. I was lacking a few\\nthroatfuls of air, but I would have gotten by. Besides, when I saw\\nmaster fainting, it left me without the slightest desire to\\nbreathe. It took my breath away, in a manner of . . .”\\n\\nConfounded by this lapse into banality, Conseil left his sentence\\nhanging.\\n\\n“My friends,” I replied, very moved, “we’re bound to each other\\nforever, and I’m deeply indebted to you—”\\n\\n“Which I’ll take advantage of,” the Canadian shot back.\\n\\n“Eh?” Conseil put in.\\n\\n“Yes,” Ned Land went on. “You can repay your debt by coming with me\\nwhen I leave this infernal Nautilus.”\\n\\n“By the way,” Conseil said, “are we going in a favorable direction?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied, “because we’re going in the direction of the sun,\\nand here the sun is due north.”\\n\\n“Sure,” Ned Land went on, “but it remains to be seen whether we’ll\\nmake for the Atlantic or the Pacific, in other words, whether we’ll\\nend up in well-traveled or deserted seas.”\\n\\nI had no reply to this, and I feared that Captain Nemo wouldn’t take\\nus homeward but rather into that huge ocean washing the shores of both\\nAsia and America. In this way he would complete his underwater tour of\\nthe world, going back to those seas where the Nautilus enjoyed the\\ngreatest freedom. But if we returned to the Pacific, far from every\\npopulated shore, what would happen to Ned Land’s plans?\\n\\nWe would soon settle this important point. The Nautilus traveled\\nswiftly. Soon we had cleared the Antarctic Circle plus the promontory\\nof Cape Horn. We were abreast of the tip of South America by March 31\\nat seven o’clock in the evening.\\n\\nBy then all our past sufferings were forgotten. The memory of that\\nimprisonment under the ice faded from our minds. We had thoughts only\\nof the future. Captain Nemo no longer appeared, neither in the lounge\\nnor on the platform. The positions reported each day on the world map\\nwere put there by the chief officer, and they enabled me to determine\\nthe Nautilus’s exact heading. Now then, that evening it became\\nobvious, much to my satisfaction, that we were returning north by the\\nAtlantic route.\\n\\nI shared the results of my observations with the Canadian and Conseil.\\n\\n“That’s good news,” the Canadian replied, “but where’s the Nautilus\\ngoing?”\\n\\n“I’m unable to say, Ned.”\\n\\n“After the South Pole, does our captain want to tackle the North Pole,\\nthen go back to the Pacific by the notorious Northwest Passage?”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t double dare him,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Oh well,” the Canadian said, “we’ll give him the slip long before\\nthen.”\\n\\n“In any event,” Conseil added, “he’s a superman, that Captain Nemo,\\nand we’ll never regret having known him.”\\n\\n“Especially once we’ve left him,” Ned Land shot back.\\n\\nThe next day, April 1, when the Nautilus rose to the surface of the\\nwaves a few minutes before noon, we raised land to the west. It was\\nTierra del Fuego, the Land of Fire, a name given it by early\\nnavigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the\\nnatives’ huts. This Land of Fire forms a huge cluster of islands over\\nthirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide, extending between\\nlatitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south, and between longitude 67\\ndegrees 50’ and 77 degrees 15’ west. Its coastline looked flat, but\\nhigh mountains rose in the distance. I even thought I glimpsed\\nMt. Sarmiento, whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level: a\\npyramid-shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit, which,\\ndepending on whether it’s clear or veiled in vapor, “predicts fair\\nweather or foul,” as Ned Land told me.\\n\\n“A first-class barometer, my friend.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, a natural barometer that didn’t let me down when I\\nnavigated the narrows of the Strait of Magellan.”\\n\\nJust then its peak appeared before us, standing out distinctly against\\nthe background of the skies. This forecast fair weather. And so it\\nproved.\\n\\nGoing back under the waters, the Nautilus drew near the coast,\\ncruising along it for only a few miles. Through the lounge windows I\\ncould see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants, bulb-bearing\\nseaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few\\nspecimens; with their smooth, viscous filaments, they measured as much\\nas 300 meters long; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very\\ntough, they’re often used as mooring lines for ships. Another weed,\\nknown by the name velp and boasting four-foot leaves, was crammed into\\nthe coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor. It served as both\\nnest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks, for\\ncrabs and cuttlefish. Here seals and otters could indulge in a\\nsumptuous meal, mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea,\\nlike the English with their Irish stews.\\n\\nThe Nautilus passed over these lush, luxuriant depths with tremendous\\nspeed. Near evening it approached the Falkland Islands, whose rugged\\nsummits I recognized the next day. The sea was of moderate depth. So\\nnot without good reason, I assumed that these two islands, plus the\\nmany islets surrounding them, used to be part of the Magellan\\ncoastline. The Falkland Islands were probably discovered by the famous\\nnavigator John Davis, who gave them the name Davis Southern\\nIslands. Later Sir Richard Hawkins called them the Maidenland, after\\nthe Blessed Virgin. Subsequently, at the beginning of the 18th\\ncentury, they were named the Malouines by fishermen from Saint-Malo in\\nBrittany, then finally dubbed the Falklands by the English, to whom\\nthey belong today.\\n\\nIn these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of algae, in\\nparticular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with the\\nworld’s best mussels. Geese and duck alighted by the dozens on the\\nplatform and soon took their places in the ship’s pantry. As for fish,\\nI specifically observed some bony fish belonging to the goby genus,\\nespecially some gudgeon two decimeters long, sprinkled with whitish\\nand yellow spots.\\n\\nI likewise marveled at the numerous medusas, including the most\\nbeautiful of their breed, the compass jellyfish, unique to the\\nFalkland seas. Some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth,\\nsemispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat\\nfestoons. Others looked like upside-down baskets from which wide\\nleaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing. They swam with\\nquiverings of their four leaflike arms, letting the opulent tresses of\\ntheir tentacles dangle in the drift. I wanted to preserve a few\\nspecimens of these delicate zoophytes, but they were merely clouds,\\nshadows, illusions, melting and evaporating outside their native\\nelement.\\n\\nWhen the last tips of the Falkland Islands had disappeared below the\\nhorizon, the Nautilus submerged to a depth between twenty and\\ntwenty-five meters and went along the South American coast. Captain\\nNemo didn’t put in an appearance.\\n\\nWe didn’t leave these Patagonian waterways until April 3, sometimes\\ncruising under the ocean, sometimes on its surface. The Nautilus\\npassed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the Rio de la Plata,\\nand on April 4 we lay abreast of Uruguay, albeit fifty miles\\nout. Keeping to its northerly heading, it followed the long windings\\nof South America. By then we had fared 16,000 leagues since coming on\\nboard in the seas of Japan.\\n\\nNear eleven o’clock in the morning, we cut the Tropic of Capricorn on\\nthe 37th meridian, passing well out from Cape Frio. Much to Ned Land’s\\ndispleasure, Captain Nemo had no liking for the neighborhood of\\nBrazil’s populous shores, because he shot by with dizzying speed. Not\\neven the swiftest fish or birds could keep up with us, and the natural\\ncuriosities in these seas completely eluded our observation.\\n\\nThis speed was maintained for several days, and on the evening of\\nApril 9, we raised South America’s easternmost tip, Cape São\\nRoque. But then the Nautilus veered away again and went looking for\\nthe lowest depths of an underwater valley gouged between this cape and\\nSierra Leone on the coast of Africa. Abreast of the West Indies, this\\nvalley forks into two arms, and to the north it ends in an enormous\\ndepression 9,000 meters deep. From this locality to the Lesser\\nAntilles, the ocean’s geologic profile features a steeply cut cliff\\nsix kilometers high, and abreast of the Cape Verde Islands, there’s\\nanother wall just as imposing; together these two barricades confine\\nthe whole submerged continent of Atlantis. The floor of this immense\\nvalley is made picturesque by mountains that furnish these underwater\\ndepths with scenic views. This description is based mostly on certain\\nhand-drawn charts kept in the Nautilus’s library, charts obviously\\nrendered by Captain Nemo himself from his own personal observations.\\n\\nFor two days we visited these deep and deserted waters by means of our\\nslanting fins. The Nautilus would do long, diagonal dives that took us\\nto every level. But on April 11 it rose suddenly, and the shore\\nreappeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a huge estuary whose\\noutflow is so considerable, it desalts the sea over an area of several\\nleagues.\\n\\nWe cut the Equator. Twenty miles to the west lay Guiana, French\\nterritory where we could easily have taken refuge. But the wind was\\nblowing a strong gust, and the furious billows would not allow us to\\nface them in a mere skiff. No doubt Ned Land understood this because\\nhe said nothing to me. For my part, I made no allusion to his escape\\nplans because I didn’t want to push him into an attempt that was\\ncertain to misfire.\\n\\nI was readily compensated for this delay by fascinating\\nresearch. During those two days of April 11-12, the Nautilus didn’t\\nleave the surface of the sea, and its trawl brought up a simply\\nmiraculous catch of zoophytes, fish, and reptiles.\\n\\nSome zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl. Most were\\nlovely sea anemone belonging to the family Actinidia, including among\\nother species, the Phyctalis protexta, native to this part of the\\nocean: a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines, mottled\\nwith red spots, and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles. As\\nfor mollusks, they consisted of exhibits I had already observed:\\nturret snails, olive shells of the “tent olive” species with neatly\\nintersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against a\\nflesh-colored background, fanciful spider conchs that looked like\\npetrified scorpions, transparent glass snails, argonauts, some highly\\nedible cuttlefish, and certain species of squid that the naturalists\\nof antiquity classified with the flying fish, which are used chiefly\\nas bait for catching cod.\\n\\nAs for the fish in these waterways, I noted various species that I\\nhadn’t yet had the opportunity to study. Among cartilaginous fish:\\nsome brook lamprey, a type of eel fifteen inches long, head greenish,\\nfins violet, back bluish gray, belly a silvery brown strewn with\\nbright spots, iris of the eye encircled in gold, unusual animals that\\nthe Amazon’s current must have swept out to sea because their natural\\nhabitat is fresh water; sting rays, the snout pointed, the tail long,\\nslender, and armed with an extensive jagged sting; small one-meter\\nsharks with gray and whitish hides, their teeth arranged in several\\nbackward-curving rows, fish commonly known by the name carpet shark;\\nbatfish, a sort of reddish isosceles triangle half a meter long, whose\\npectoral fins are attached by fleshy extensions that make these fish\\nlook like bats, although an appendage made of horn, located near the\\nnostrils, earns them the nickname of sea unicorns; lastly, a couple\\nspecies of triggerfish, the cucuyo whose stippled flanks glitter with\\na sparkling gold color, and the bright purple leatherjacket whose hues\\nglisten like a pigeon’s throat.\\n\\nI’ll finish up this catalog, a little dry but quite accurate, with the\\nseries of bony fish I observed: eels belonging to the genus\\nApteronotus whose snow-white snout is very blunt, the body painted a\\nhandsome black and armed with a very long, slender, fleshy whip; long\\nsardines from the genus Odontognathus, like three-decimeter pike,\\nshining with a bright silver glow; Guaranian mackerel furnished with\\ntwo anal fins; black-tinted rudderfish that you catch by using\\ntorches, fish measuring two meters and boasting white, firm, plump\\nmeat that, when fresh, tastes like eel, when dried, like smoked\\nsalmon; semired wrasse sporting scales only at the bases of their\\ndorsal and anal fins; grunts on which gold and silver mingle their\\nluster with that of ruby and topaz; yellow-tailed gilthead whose flesh\\nis extremely dainty and whose phosphorescent properties give them away\\nin the midst of the waters; porgies tinted orange, with slender\\ntongues; croakers with gold caudal fins; black surgeonfish; four-eyed\\nfish from Surinam, etc.\\n\\nThis “et cetera” won’t keep me from mentioning one more fish that\\nConseil, with good reason, will long remember.\\n\\nOne of our nets had hauled up a type of very flat ray that weighed\\nsome twenty kilograms; with its tail cut off, it would have formed a\\nperfect disk. It was white underneath and reddish on top, with big\\nround spots of deep blue encircled in black, its hide quite smooth and\\nending in a double-lobed fin. Laid out on the platform, it kept\\nstruggling with convulsive movements, trying to turn over, making such\\nefforts that its final lunge was about to flip it into the sea. But\\nConseil, being very possessive of his fish, rushed at it, and before I\\ncould stop him, he seized it with both hands.\\n\\nInstantly there he was, thrown on his back, legs in the air, his body\\nhalf paralyzed, and yelling:\\n\\n“Oh, sir, sir! Will you help me!”\\n\\nFor once in his life, the poor lad didn’t address me “in the third\\nperson.”\\n\\nThe Canadian and I sat him up; we massaged his contracted arms, and\\nwhen he regained his five senses, that eternal classifier mumbled in a\\nbroken voice:\\n\\n“Class of cartilaginous fish, order Chondropterygia with fixed gills,\\nsuborder Selacia, family Rajiiforma, genus electric ray.”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend,” I answered, “it was an electric ray that put you in\\nthis deplorable state.”\\n\\n“Oh, master can trust me on this,” Conseil shot back. “I’ll be\\nrevenged on that animal!”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“I’ll eat it.”\\n\\nWhich he did that same evening, but strictly as retaliation. Because,\\nfrankly, it tasted like leather.\\n\\nPoor Conseil had assaulted an electric ray of the most dangerous\\nspecies, the cumana. Living in a conducting medium such as water, this\\nbizarre animal can electrocute other fish from several meters away, so\\ngreat is the power of its electric organ, an organ whose two chief\\nsurfaces measure at least twenty-seven square feet.\\n\\nDuring the course of the next day, April 12, the Nautilus drew near\\nthe coast of Dutch Guiana, by the mouth of the Maroni River. There\\nseveral groups of sea cows were living in family units. These were\\nmanatees, which belong to the order Sirenia, like the dugong and\\nSteller’s sea cow. Harmless and unaggressive, these fine animals were\\nsix to seven meters long and must have weighed at least 4,000\\nkilograms each. I told Ned Land and Conseil that farseeing nature had\\ngiven these mammals a major role to play. In essence, manatees, like\\nseals, are designed to graze the underwater prairies, destroying the\\nclusters of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers.\\n\\n“And do you know,” I added, “what happened since man has almost\\ncompletely wiped out these beneficial races? Rotting weeds have\\npoisoned the air, and this poisoned air causes the yellow fever that\\ndevastates these wonderful countries. This toxic vegetation has\\nincreased beneath the seas of the Torrid Zone, so the disease spreads\\nunchecked from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida!”\\n\\nAnd if Professor Toussenel is correct, this plague is nothing compared\\nto the scourge that will strike our descendants once the seas are\\ndepopulated of whales and seals. By then, crowded with jellyfish,\\nsquid, and other devilfish, the oceans will have become huge centers\\nof infection, because their waves will no longer possess “these huge\\nstomachs that God has entrusted with scouring the surface of the sea.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, without scorning these theories, the Nautilus’s crew\\ncaptured half a dozen manatees. In essence, it was an issue of\\nstocking the larder with excellent red meat, even better than beef or\\nveal. Their hunting was not a fascinating sport. The manatees let\\nthemselves be struck down without offering any resistance. Several\\nthousand kilos of meat were hauled below, to be dried and stored.\\n\\nThe same day an odd fishing practice further increased the Nautilus’s\\nstores, so full of game were these seas. Our trawl brought up in its\\nmeshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs\\nwith fleshy edges. These were suckerfish from the third family of the\\nsubbrachian Malacopterygia. These flat disks on their heads consist of\\ncrosswise plates of movable cartilage, between which the animals can\\ncreate a vacuum, enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups.\\n\\nThe remoras I had observed in the Mediterranean were related to this\\nspecies. But the creature at issue here was an Echeneis osteochara,\\nunique to this sea. Right after catching them, our seamen dropped them\\nin buckets of water.\\n\\nIts fishing finished, the Nautilus drew nearer to the coast. In this\\nlocality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface of the\\nwaves. It would have been difficult to capture these valuable\\nreptiles, because they wake up at the slightest sound, and their solid\\ncarapaces are harpoon-proof. But our suckerfish would effect their\\ncapture with extraordinary certainty and precision. In truth, this\\nanimal is a living fishhook, promising wealth and happiness to the\\ngreenest fisherman in the business.\\n\\nThe Nautilus’s men attached to each fish’s tail a ring that was big\\nenough not to hamper its movements, and to this ring a long rope whose\\nother end was moored on board.\\n\\nThrown into the sea, the suckerfish immediately began to play their\\nroles, going and fastening themselves onto the breastplates of the\\nturtles. Their tenacity was so great, they would rip apart rather than\\nlet go. They were hauled in, still sticking to the turtles that came\\naboard with them.\\n\\nIn this way we caught several loggerheads, reptiles a meter wide and\\nweighing 200 kilos. They’re extremely valuable because of their\\ncarapaces, which are covered with big slabs of horn, thin, brown,\\ntransparent, with white and yellow markings. Besides, they were\\nexcellent from an edible viewpoint, with an exquisite flavor\\ncomparable to the green turtle.\\n\\nThis fishing ended our stay in the waterways of the Amazon, and that\\nevening the Nautilus took to the high seas once more.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\nThe Devilfish\\n\\n\\nFOR SOME DAYS the Nautilus kept veering away from the American\\ncoast. It obviously didn’t want to frequent the waves of the Gulf of\\nMexico or the Caribbean Sea. Yet there was no shortage of water under\\nits keel, since the average depth of these seas is 1,800 meters; but\\nthese waterways, strewn with islands and plowed by steamers, probably\\ndidn’t agree with Captain Nemo.\\n\\nOn April 16 we raised Martinique and Guadalupe from a distance of\\nabout thirty miles. For one instant I could see their lofty peaks.\\n\\nThe Canadian was quite disheartened, having counted on putting his\\nplans into execution in the gulf, either by reaching shore or by\\npulling alongside one of the many boats plying a coastal trade from\\none island to another. An escape attempt would have been quite\\nfeasible, assuming Ned Land managed to seize the skiff without the\\ncaptain’s knowledge. But in midocean it was unthinkable.\\n\\nThe Canadian, Conseil, and I had a pretty long conversation on this\\nsubject. For six months we had been prisoners aboard the Nautilus. We\\nhad fared 17,000 leagues, and as Ned Land put it, there was no end in\\nsight. So he made me a proposition I hadn’t anticipated. We were to\\nask Captain Nemo this question straight out: did the captain mean to\\nkeep us on board his vessel permanently?\\n\\nThis measure was distasteful to me. To my mind it would lead\\nnowhere. We could hope for nothing from the Nautilus’s commander but\\ncould depend only on ourselves. Besides, for some time now the man had\\nbeen gloomier, more withdrawn, less sociable. He seemed to be avoiding\\nme. I encountered him only at rare intervals. He used to take pleasure\\nin explaining the underwater wonders to me; now he left me to my\\nresearch and no longer entered the lounge.\\n\\nWhat changes had come over him? From what cause? I had no reason to\\nblame myself. Was our presence on board perhaps a burden to him? Even\\nso, I cherished no hopes that the man would set us free.\\n\\nSo I begged Ned to let me think about it before taking action. If this\\nmeasure proved fruitless, it could arouse the captain’s suspicions,\\nmake our circumstances even more arduous, and jeopardize the\\nCanadian’s plans. I might add that I could hardly use our state of\\nhealth as an argument. Except for that grueling ordeal under the Ice\\nBank at the South Pole, we had never felt better, neither Ned,\\nConseil, nor I. The nutritious food, life-giving air, regular routine,\\nand uniform temperature kept illness at bay; and for a man who didn’t\\nmiss his past existence on land, for a Captain Nemo who was at home\\nhere, who went where he wished, who took paths mysterious to others if\\nnot himself in attaining his ends, I could understand such a life. But\\nwe ourselves hadn’t severed all ties with humanity. For my part, I\\ndidn’t want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones. I\\nhad now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea, and\\nsooner or later I wanted that book to see the light of day.\\n\\nThere once more, through the panels opening into these Caribbean\\nwaters ten meters below the surface of the waves, I found so many\\nfascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes! Among other\\nzoophytes there were Portuguese men-of-war known by the name Physalia\\npelagica, like big, oblong bladders with a pearly sheen, spreading\\ntheir membranes to the wind, letting their blue tentacles drift like\\nsilken threads; to the eye delightful jellyfish, to the touch actual\\nnettles that ooze a corrosive liquid. Among the articulates there were\\nannelid worms one and a half meters long, furnished with a pink\\nproboscis, equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion, snaking through\\nthe waters, and as they went, throwing off every gleam in the solar\\nspectrum. From the fish branch there were manta rays, enormous\\ncartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds, their\\npectoral fin triangular, their midback slightly arched, their eyes\\nattached to the edges of the face at the front of the head; they\\nfloated like wreckage from a ship, sometimes fastening onto our\\nwindows like opaque shutters. There were American triggerfish for\\nwhich nature has ground only black and white pigments, feather-shaped\\ngobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws,\\nsixteen-decimeter mackerel with short, sharp teeth, covered with small\\nscales, and related to the albacore species. Next came swarms of red\\nmullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail, their shining fins\\nall aquiver, genuine masterpieces of jewelry, formerly sacred to the\\ngoddess Diana, much in demand by rich Romans, and about which the old\\nsaying goes: “He who catches them doesn’t eat them!” Finally, adorned\\nwith emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk, golden angelfish\\npassed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of Veronese;\\nspurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins; thread\\nherring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent\\nglimmers; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails;\\nred salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals; and\\nsilver moonfish, worthy of their name, rose on the horizon of the\\nwaters like the whitish reflections of many moons.\\n\\nHow many other marvelous new specimens I still could have observed if,\\nlittle by little, the Nautilus hadn’t settled to the lower strata! Its\\nslanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters. There\\nanimal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies, starfish,\\ndelightful crinoids with bell-shaped heads like little chalices on\\nstraight stems, top-shell snails, blood-red tooth shells, and\\nfissurella snails, a large species of coastal mollusk.\\n\\nBy April 20 we had risen to an average level of 1,500 meters. The\\nnearest land was the island group of the Bahamas, scattered like a\\nbatch of cobblestones over the surface of the water. There high\\nunderwater cliffs reared up, straight walls made of craggy chunks\\narranged like big stone foundations, among which there gaped black\\ncaves so deep our electric rays couldn’t light them to the far ends.\\n\\nThese rocks were hung with huge weeds, immense sea tangle, gigantic\\nfucus—a genuine trellis of water plants fit for a world of giants.\\n\\nIn discussing these colossal plants, Conseil, Ned, and I were\\nnaturally led into mentioning the sea’s gigantic animals. The former\\nwere obviously meant to feed the latter. However, through the windows\\nof our almost motionless Nautilus, I could see nothing among these\\nlong filaments other than the chief articulates of the division\\nBrachyura: long-legged spider crabs, violet crabs, and sponge crabs\\nunique to the waters of the Caribbean.\\n\\nIt was about eleven o’clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a\\nfearsome commotion out in this huge seaweed.\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “these are real devilfish caverns, and I wouldn’t be\\nsurprised to see some of those monsters hereabouts.”\\n\\n“What!” Conseil put in. “Squid, ordinary squid from the class\\nCephalopoda?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, “devilfish of large dimensions. But friend Land is no\\ndoubt mistaken, because I don’t see a thing.”\\n\\n“That’s regrettable,” Conseil answered. “I’d like to come face to face\\nwith one of those devilfish I’ve heard so much about, which can drag\\nships down into the depths. Those beasts go by the name of krake—”\\n\\n“Fake is more like it,” the Canadian replied sarcastically.\\n\\n“Krakens!” Conseil shot back, finishing his word without wincing at\\nhis companion’s witticism.\\n\\n“Nobody will ever make me believe,” Ned Land said, “that such animals\\nexist.”\\n\\n“Why not?” Conseil replied. “We sincerely believed in master’s\\nnarwhale.”\\n\\n“We were wrong, Conseil.”\\n\\n“No doubt, but there are others with no doubts who believe to this\\nday!”\\n\\n“Probably, Conseil. But as for me, I’m bound and determined not to\\naccept the existence of any such monster till I’ve dissected it with\\nmy own two hands.”\\n\\n“Yet,” Conseil asked me, “doesn’t master believe in gigantic\\ndevilfish?”\\n\\n“Yikes! Who in Hades ever believed in them?” the Canadian exclaimed.\\n\\n“Many people, Ned my friend,” I said.\\n\\n“No fishermen. Scientists maybe!”\\n\\n“Pardon me, Ned. Fishermen and scientists!”\\n\\n“Why, I to whom you speak,” Conseil said with the world’s straightest\\nface, “I recall perfectly seeing a large boat dragged under the waves\\nby the arms of a cephalopod.”\\n\\n“You saw that?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“Yes, Ned.”\\n\\n“With your own two eyes?”\\n\\n“With my own two eyes.”\\n\\n“Where, may I ask?”\\n\\n“In Saint-Malo,” Conseil returned unflappably.\\n\\n“In the harbor?” Ned Land said sarcastically.\\n\\n“No, in a church,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“In a church!” the Canadian exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, Ned my friend. It had a picture that portrayed the devilfish in\\nquestion.”\\n\\n“Oh good!” Ned Land exclaimed with a burst of laughter. “Mr. Conseil\\nput one over on me!”\\n\\n“Actually he’s right,” I said. “I’ve heard about that picture. But the\\nsubject it portrays is taken from a legend, and you know how to rate\\nlegends in matters of natural history! Besides, when it’s an issue of\\nmonsters, the human imagination always tends to run wild. People not\\nonly claimed these devilfish could drag ships under, but a certain\\nOlaus Magnus tells of a cephalopod a mile long that looked more like\\nan island than an animal. There’s also the story of how the Bishop of\\nTrondheim set up an altar one day on an immense rock. After he\\nfinished saying mass, this rock started moving and went back into the\\nsea. The rock was a devilfish.”\\n\\n“And that’s everything we know?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“No,” I replied, “another bishop, Pontoppidan of Bergen, also tells of\\na devilfish so large a whole cavalry regiment could maneuver on it.”\\n\\n“They sure did go on, those oldtime bishops!” Ned Land said.\\n\\n“Finally, the naturalists of antiquity mention some monsters with\\nmouths as big as a gulf, which were too huge to get through the Strait\\nof Gibraltar.”\\n\\n“Good work, men!” the Canadian put in.\\n\\n“But in all these stories, is there any truth?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“None at all, my friends, at least in those that go beyond the bounds\\nof credibility and fly off into fable or legend. Yet for the\\nimaginings of these storytellers there had to be, if not a cause, at\\nleast an excuse. It can’t be denied that some species of squid and\\nother devilfish are quite large, though still smaller than\\ncetaceans. Aristotle put the dimensions of one squid at five cubits,\\nor 3.1 meters. Our fishermen frequently see specimens over 1.8 meters\\nlong. The museums in Trieste and Montpellier have preserved some\\ndevilfish carcasses measuring two meters. Besides, according to the\\ncalculations of naturalists, one of these animals only six feet long\\nwould have tentacles as long as twenty-seven. Which is enough to make\\na fearsome monster.”\\n\\n“Does anybody fish for ‘em nowadays?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“If they don’t fish for them, sailors at least sight them. A friend of\\nmine, Captain Paul Bos of Le Havre, has often sworn to me that he\\nencountered one of these monsters of colossal size in the seas of the\\nEast Indies. But the most astonishing event, which proves that these\\ngigantic animals undeniably exist, took place a few years ago in\\n1861.”\\n\\n“What event was that?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\n“Just this. In 1861, to the northeast of Tenerife and fairly near the\\nlatitude where we are right now, the crew of the gunboat Alecto\\nspotted a monstrous squid swimming in their waters. Commander Bouguer\\napproached the animal and attacked it with blows from harpoons and\\nblasts from rifles, but without much success because bullets and\\nharpoons crossed its soft flesh as if it were semiliquid jelly. After\\nseveral fruitless attempts, the crew managed to slip a noose around\\nthe mollusk’s body. This noose slid as far as the caudal fins and came\\nto a halt. Then they tried to haul the monster on board, but its\\nweight was so considerable that when they tugged on the rope, the\\nanimal parted company with its tail; and deprived of this adornment,\\nit disappeared beneath the waters.”\\n\\n“Finally, an actual event,” Ned Land said.\\n\\n“An indisputable event, my gallant Ned. Accordingly, people have\\nproposed naming this devilfish Bouguer’s Squid.”\\n\\n“And how long was it?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“Didn’t it measure about six meters?” said Conseil, who was stationed\\nat the window and examining anew the crevices in the cliff.\\n\\n“Precisely,” I replied.\\n\\n“Wasn’t its head,” Conseil went on, “crowned by eight tentacles that\\nquivered in the water like a nest of snakes?”\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“Weren’t its eyes prominently placed and considerably enlarged?”\\n\\n“Yes, Conseil.”\\n\\n“And wasn’t its mouth a real parrot’s beak but of fearsome size?”\\n\\n“Correct, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Well, with all due respect to master,” Conseil replied serenely, “if\\nthis isn’t Bouguer’s Squid, it’s at least one of his close relatives!”\\n\\nI stared at Conseil. Ned Land rushed to the window.\\n\\n“What an awful animal!” he exclaimed.\\n\\nI stared in my turn and couldn’t keep back a movement of\\nrevulsion. Before my eyes there quivered a horrible monster worthy of\\na place among the most farfetched teratological legends.\\n\\nIt was a squid of colossal dimensions, fully eight meters long. It was\\ntraveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the\\nNautilus. It gazed with enormous, staring eyes that were tinted sea\\ngreen. Its eight arms (or more accurately, feet) were rooted in its\\nhead, which has earned these animals the name cephalopod; its arms\\nstretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing\\nlike the serpentine hair of the Furies. You could plainly see its 250\\nsuckers, arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped\\nlike semispheric capsules. Sometimes these suckers fastened onto the\\nlounge window by creating vacuums against it. The monster’s mouth—a\\nbeak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot—opened and closed\\nvertically. Its tongue, also of horn substance and armed with several\\nrows of sharp teeth, would flicker out from between these genuine\\nshears. What a freak of nature! A bird’s beak on a mollusk! Its body\\nwas spindle-shaped and swollen in the middle, a fleshy mass that must\\nhave weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms. Its unstable color would\\nchange with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated, passing\\nsuccessively from bluish gray to reddish brown.\\n\\nWhat was irritating this mollusk? No doubt the presence of the\\nNautilus, even more fearsome than itself, and which it couldn’t grip\\nwith its mandibles or the suckers on its arms. And yet what monsters\\nthese devilfish are, what vitality our Creator has given them, what\\nvigor in their movements, thanks to their owning a triple heart!\\n\\nSheer chance had placed us in the presence of this squid, and I didn’t\\nwant to lose this opportunity to meticulously study such a cephalopod\\nspecimen. I overcame the horror that its appearance inspired in me,\\npicked up a pencil, and began to sketch it.\\n\\n“Perhaps this is the same as the Alecto’s,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Can’t be,” the Canadian replied, “because this one’s complete while\\nthe other one lost its tail!”\\n\\n“That doesn’t necessarily follow,” I said. “The arms and tails of\\nthese animals grow back through regeneration, and in seven years the\\ntail on Bouguer’s Squid has surely had time to sprout again.”\\n\\n“Anyhow,” Ned shot back, “if it isn’t this fellow, maybe it’s one of\\nthose!”\\n\\nIndeed, other devilfish had appeared at the starboard window. I\\ncounted seven of them. They provided the Nautilus with an escort, and\\nI could hear their beaks gnashing on the sheet-iron hull. We couldn’t\\nhave asked for a more devoted following.\\n\\nI continued sketching. These monsters kept pace in our waters with\\nsuch precision, they seemed to be standing still, and I could have\\ntraced their outlines in miniature on the window. But we were moving\\nat a moderate speed.\\n\\nAll at once the Nautilus stopped. A jolt made it tremble through its\\nentire framework.\\n\\n“Did we strike bottom?” I asked.\\n\\n“In any event we’re already clear,” the Canadian replied, “because\\nwe’re afloat.”\\n\\nThe Nautilus was certainly afloat, but it was no longer in motion. The\\nblades of its propeller weren’t churning the waves. A minute\\npassed. Followed by his chief officer, Captain Nemo entered the\\nlounge.\\n\\nI hadn’t seen him for a good while. He looked gloomy to me. Without\\nspeaking to us, without even seeing us perhaps, he went to the panel,\\nstared at the devilfish, and said a few words to his chief officer.\\n\\nThe latter went out. Soon the panels closed. The ceiling lit up.\\n\\nI went over to the captain.\\n\\n“An unusual assortment of devilfish,” I told him, as carefree as a\\ncollector in front of an aquarium.\\n\\n“Correct, Mr. Naturalist,” he answered me, “and we’re going to fight\\nthem at close quarters.”\\n\\nI gaped at the captain. I thought my hearing had gone bad.\\n\\n“At close quarters?” I repeated.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Our propeller is jammed. I think the horn-covered mandibles\\nof one of these squid are entangled in the blades. That’s why we\\naren’t moving.”\\n\\n“And what are you going to do?”\\n\\n“Rise to the surface and slaughter the vermin.”\\n\\n“A difficult undertaking.”\\n\\n“Correct. Our electric bullets are ineffective against such soft\\nflesh, where they don’t meet enough resistance to go off. But we’ll\\nattack the beasts with axes.”\\n\\n“And harpoons, sir,” the Canadian said, “if you don’t turn down my\\nhelp.”\\n\\n“I accept it, Mr. Land.”\\n\\n“We’ll go with you,” I said. And we followed Captain Nemo, heading to\\nthe central companionway.\\n\\nThere some ten men were standing by for the assault, armed with\\nboarding axes. Conseil and I picked up two more axes. Ned Land seized\\na harpoon.\\n\\nBy then the Nautilus had returned to the surface of the\\nwaves. Stationed on the top steps, one of the seamen undid the bolts\\nof the hatch. But he had scarcely unscrewed the nuts when the hatch\\nflew up with tremendous violence, obviously pulled open by the suckers\\non a devilfish’s arm.\\n\\nInstantly one of those long arms glided like a snake into the opening,\\nand twenty others were quivering above. With a sweep of the ax,\\nCaptain Nemo chopped off this fearsome tentacle, which slid writhing\\ndown the steps.\\n\\nJust as we were crowding each other to reach the platform, two more\\narms lashed the air, swooped on the seaman stationed in front of\\nCaptain Nemo, and carried the fellow away with irresistible violence.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo gave a shout and leaped outside. We rushed after him.\\n\\nWhat a scene! Seized by the tentacle and glued to its suckers, the\\nunfortunate man was swinging in the air at the mercy of this enormous\\nappendage. He gasped, he choked, he yelled: “Help! Help!” These words,\\npronounced in French, left me deeply stunned! So I had a fellow\\ncountryman on board, perhaps several! I’ll hear his harrowing plea the\\nrest of my life!\\n\\nThe poor fellow was done for. Who could tear him from such a powerful\\ngrip? Even so, Captain Nemo rushed at the devilfish and with a sweep\\nof the ax hewed one more of its arms. His chief officer struggled\\nfuriously with other monsters crawling up the Nautilus’s sides. The\\ncrew battled with flailing axes. The Canadian, Conseil, and I sank our\\nweapons into these fleshy masses. An intense, musky odor filled the\\nair. It was horrible.\\n\\nFor an instant I thought the poor man entwined by the devilfish might\\nbe torn loose from its powerful suction. Seven arms out of eight had\\nbeen chopped off. Brandishing its victim like a feather, one lone\\ntentacle was writhing in the air. But just as Captain Nemo and his\\nchief officer rushed at it, the animal shot off a spout of blackish\\nliquid, secreted by a pouch located in its abdomen. It blinded\\nus. When this cloud had dispersed, the squid was gone, and so was my\\npoor fellow countryman!\\n\\nWhat rage then drove us against these monsters! We lost all\\nself-control. Ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the Nautilus’s\\nplatform and sides. We piled helter-skelter into the thick of these\\nsawed-off snakes, which darted over the platform amid waves of blood\\nand sepia ink. It seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like\\nthe many heads of Hydra. At every thrust Ned Land’s harpoon would\\nplunge into a squid’s sea-green eye and burst it. But my daring\\ncompanion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could\\nnot avoid.\\n\\nOh, my heart nearly exploded with excitement and horror! The squid’s\\nfearsome beak was wide open over Ned Land. The poor man was about to\\nbe cut in half. I ran to his rescue. But Captain Nemo got there\\nfirst. His ax disappeared between the two enormous mandibles, and the\\nCanadian, miraculously saved, stood and plunged his harpoon all the\\nway into the devilfish’s triple heart.\\n\\n“Tit for tat,” Captain Nemo told the Canadian. “I owed it to myself!”\\n\\nNed bowed without answering him.\\n\\nThis struggle had lasted a quarter of an hour. Defeated, mutilated,\\nbattered to death, the monsters finally yielded to us and disappeared\\nbeneath the waves.\\n\\nRed with blood, motionless by the beacon, Captain Nemo stared at the\\nsea that had swallowed one of his companions, and large tears streamed\\nfrom his eyes.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\nThe Gulf Stream\\n\\n\\nTHIS DREADFUL SCENE on April 20 none of us will ever be able to\\nforget. I wrote it up in a state of intense excitement. Later I\\nreviewed my narrative. I read it to Conseil and the Canadian. They\\nfound it accurate in detail but deficient in impact. To convey such\\nsights, it would take the pen of our most famous poet, Victor Hugo,\\nauthor of The Toilers of the Sea.\\n\\nAs I said, Captain Nemo wept while staring at the waves. His grief was\\nimmense. This was the second companion he had lost since we had come\\naboard. And what a way to die! Smashed, strangled, crushed by the\\nfearsome arms of a devilfish, ground between its iron mandibles, this\\nfriend would never rest with his companions in the placid waters of\\ntheir coral cemetery!\\n\\nAs for me, what had harrowed my heart in the thick of this struggle\\nwas the despairing yell given by this unfortunate man. Forgetting his\\nregulation language, this poor Frenchman had reverted to speaking his\\nown mother tongue to fling out one supreme plea! Among the Nautilus’s\\ncrew, allied body and soul with Captain Nemo and likewise fleeing from\\nhuman contact, I had found a fellow countryman! Was he the only\\nrepresentative of France in this mysterious alliance, obviously made\\nup of individuals from different nationalities? This was just one more\\nof those insoluble problems that kept welling up in my mind!\\n\\nCaptain Nemo reentered his stateroom, and I saw no more of him for a\\ngood while. But how sad, despairing, and irresolute he must have felt,\\nto judge from this ship whose soul he was, which reflected his every\\nmood! The Nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading. It drifted back\\nand forth, riding with the waves like a corpse. Its propeller had been\\ndisentangled but was barely put to use. It was navigating at\\nrandom. It couldn’t tear itself away from the setting of this last\\nstruggle, from this sea that had devoured one of its own!\\n\\nTen days went by in this way. It was only on May 1 that the Nautilus\\nopenly resumed its northbound course, after raising the Bahamas at the\\nmouth of Old Bahama Channel. We then went with the current of the\\nsea’s greatest river, which has its own banks, fish, and\\ntemperature. I mean the Gulf Stream.\\n\\nIt is indeed a river that runs independently through the middle of the\\nAtlantic, its waters never mixing with the ocean’s waters. It’s a\\nsalty river, saltier than the sea surrounding it. Its average depth is\\n3,000 feet, its average width sixty miles. In certain localities its\\ncurrent moves at a speed of four kilometers per hour. The unchanging\\nvolume of its waters is greater than that of all the world’s rivers\\ncombined.\\n\\nAs discovered by Commander Maury, the true source of the Gulf Stream,\\nits starting point, if you prefer, is located in the Bay of\\nBiscay. There its waters, still weak in temperature and color, begin\\nto form. It goes down south, skirts equatorial Africa, warms its waves\\nin the rays of the Torrid Zone, crosses the Atlantic, reaches Cape São\\nRoque on the coast of Brazil, and forks into two branches, one going\\nto the Caribbean Sea for further saturation with heat particles. Then,\\nentrusted with restoring the balance between hot and cold temperatures\\nand with mixing tropical and northern waters, the Gulf Stream begins\\nto play its stabilizing role. Attaining a white heat in the Gulf of\\nMexico, it heads north up the American coast, advances as far as\\nNewfoundland, swerves away under the thrust of a cold current from the\\nDavis Strait, and resumes its ocean course by going along a great\\ncircle of the earth on a rhumb line; it then divides into two arms\\nnear the 43rd parallel; one, helped by the northeast trade winds,\\nreturns to the Bay of Biscay and the Azores; the other washes the\\nshores of Ireland and Norway with lukewarm water, goes beyond\\nSpitzbergen, where its temperature falls to 4 degrees centigrade, and\\nfashions the open sea at the pole.\\n\\nIt was on this oceanic river that the Nautilus was then\\nnavigating. Leaving Old Bahama Channel, which is fourteen leagues wide\\nby 350 meters deep, the Gulf Stream moves at the rate of eight\\nkilometers per hour. Its speed steadily decreases as it advances\\nnorthward, and we must pray that this steadiness continues, because,\\nas experts agree, if its speed and direction were to change, the\\nclimates of Europe would undergo disturbances whose consequences are\\nincalculable.\\n\\nNear noon I was on the platform with Conseil. I shared with him the\\nrelevant details on the Gulf Stream. When my explanation was over, I\\ninvited him to dip his hands into its current.\\n\\nConseil did so, and he was quite astonished to experience no sensation\\nof either hot or cold.\\n\\n“That comes,” I told him, “from the water temperature of the Gulf\\nStream, which, as it leaves the Gulf of Mexico, is barely different\\nfrom your blood temperature. This Gulf Stream is a huge heat generator\\nthat enables the coasts of Europe to be decked in eternal\\ngreenery. And if Commander Maury is correct, were one to harness the\\nfull warmth of this current, it would supply enough heat to keep\\nmolten a river of iron solder as big as the Amazon or the Missouri.”\\n\\nJust then the Gulf Stream’s speed was 2.25 meters per second. So\\ndistinct is its current from the surrounding sea, its confined waters\\nstand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the\\ncolder waters. Murky as well, and very rich in saline material, their\\npure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them. Moreover,\\ntheir line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the Carolinas,\\nthe Nautilus’s spur cut the waves of the Gulf Stream while its\\npropeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean.\\n\\nThis current swept along with it a whole host of moving\\ncreatures. Argonauts, so common in the Mediterranean, voyaged here in\\nschools of large numbers. Among cartilaginous fish, the most\\nremarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third\\nof the body, which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty-five feet\\nlong; then little one-meter sharks, the head large, the snout short\\nand rounded, the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows, the body\\nseemingly covered with scales.\\n\\nAmong bony fish, I noted grizzled wrasse unique to these seas,\\ndeep-water gilthead whose iris has a fiery gleam, one-meter croakers\\nwhose large mouths bristle with small teeth and which let out thin\\ncries, black rudderfish like those I’ve already discussed, blue\\ndorados accented with gold and silver, rainbow-hued parrotfish that\\ncan rival the loveliest tropical birds in coloring, banded blennies\\nwith triangular heads, bluish flounder without scales, toadfish\\ncovered with a crosswise yellow band in the shape of a Greek t, swarms\\nof little freckled gobies stippled with brown spots, lungfish with\\nsilver heads and yellow tails, various specimens of salmon, mullet\\nwith slim figures and a softly glowing radiance that Lacépède\\ndedicated to the memory of his wife, and finally the American cavalla,\\na handsome fish decorated by every honorary order, bedizened with\\ntheir every ribbon, frequenting the shores of this great nation where\\nribbons and orders are held in such low esteem.\\n\\nI might add that during the night, the Gulf Stream’s phosphorescent\\nwaters rivaled the electric glow of our beacon, especially in the\\nstormy weather that frequently threatened us.\\n\\nOn May 8, while abreast of North Carolina, we were across from Cape\\nHatteras once more. There the Gulf Stream is seventy-five miles wide\\nand 210 meters deep. The Nautilus continued to wander at\\nrandom. Seemingly, all supervision had been jettisoned. Under these\\nconditions I admit that we could easily have gotten away. In fact, the\\npopulous shores offered ready refuge everywhere. The sea was plowed\\ncontinuously by the many steamers providing service between the Gulf\\nof Mexico and New York or Boston, and it was crossed night and day by\\nlittle schooners engaged in coastal trade over various points on the\\nAmerican shore. We could hope to be picked up. So it was a promising\\nopportunity, despite the thirty miles that separated the Nautilus from\\nthese Union coasts.\\n\\nBut one distressing circumstance totally thwarted the Canadian’s\\nplans. The weather was thoroughly foul. We were approaching waterways\\nwhere storms are commonplace, the very homeland of tornadoes and\\ncyclones specifically engendered by the Gulf Stream’s current. To face\\na frequently raging sea in a frail skiff was a race to certain\\ndisaster. Ned Land conceded this himself. So he champed at the bit, in\\nthe grip of an intense homesickness that could be cured only by our\\nescape.\\n\\n“Sir,” he told me that day, “it’s got to stop. I want to get to the\\nbottom of this. Your Nemo’s veering away from shore and heading up\\nnorth. But believe you me, I had my fill at the South Pole and I’m not\\ngoing with him to the North Pole.”\\n\\n“What can we do, Ned, since it isn’t feasible to escape right now?”\\n\\n“I keep coming back to my idea. We’ve got to talk to the captain. When\\nwe were in your own country’s seas, you didn’t say a word. Now that\\nwe’re in mine, I intend to speak up. Before a few days are out, I\\nfigure the Nautilus will lie abreast of Nova Scotia, and from there to\\nNewfoundland is the mouth of a large gulf, and the St. Lawrence\\nempties into that gulf, and the St. Lawrence is my own river, the\\nriver running by Quebec, my hometown—and when I think about all this,\\nmy gorge rises and my hair stands on end! Honestly, sir, I’d rather\\njump overboard! I can’t stay here any longer! I’m suffocating!”\\n\\nThe Canadian was obviously at the end of his patience. His vigorous\\nnature couldn’t adapt to this protracted imprisonment. His facial\\nappearance was changing by the day. His moods grew gloomier and\\ngloomier. I had a sense of what he was suffering because I also was\\ngripped by homesickness. Nearly seven months had gone by without our\\nhaving any news from shore. Moreover, Captain Nemo’s reclusiveness,\\nhis changed disposition, and especially his total silence since the\\nbattle with the devilfish all made me see things in a different\\nlight. I no longer felt the enthusiasm of our first days on board. You\\nneeded to be Flemish like Conseil to accept these circumstances,\\nliving in a habitat designed for cetaceans and other denizens of the\\ndeep. Truly, if that gallant lad had owned gills instead of lungs, I\\nthink he would have made an outstanding fish!\\n\\n“Well, sir?” Ned Land went on, seeing that I hadn’t replied.\\n\\n“Well, Ned, you want me to ask Captain Nemo what he intends to do with\\nus?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Even though he has already made that clear?”\\n\\n“Yes. I want it settled once and for all. Speak just for me, strictly\\non my behalf, if you want.”\\n\\n“But I rarely encounter him. He positively avoids me.”\\n\\n“All the more reason you should go look him up.”\\n\\n“I’ll confer with him, Ned.”\\n\\n“When?” the Canadian asked insistently.\\n\\n“When I encounter him.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax, would you like me to go find him myself?”\\n\\n“No, let me do it. Tomorrow—”\\n\\n“Today,” Ned Land said.\\n\\n“So be it. I’ll see him today,” I answered the Canadian, who, if he\\ntook action himself, would certainly have ruined everything.\\n\\nI was left to myself. His request granted, I decided to dispose of it\\nimmediately. I like things over and done with.\\n\\nI reentered my stateroom. From there I could hear movements inside\\nCaptain Nemo’s quarters. I couldn’t pass up this chance for an\\nencounter. I knocked on his door. I received no reply. I knocked\\nagain, then tried the knob. The door opened.\\n\\nI entered. The captain was there. He was bending over his worktable\\nand hadn’t heard me. Determined not to leave without questioning him,\\nI drew closer. He looked up sharply, with a frowning brow, and said in\\na pretty stern tone:\\n\\n“Oh, it’s you! What do you want?”\\n\\n“To speak with you, captain.”\\n\\n“But I’m busy, sir, I’m at work. I give you the freedom to enjoy your\\nprivacy, can’t I have the same for myself?”\\n\\nThis reception was less than encouraging. But I was determined to give\\nas good as I got.\\n\\n“Sir,” I said coolly, “I need to speak with you on a matter that\\nsimply can’t wait.”\\n\\n“Whatever could that be, sir?” he replied sarcastically. “Have you\\nmade some discovery that has escaped me? Has the sea yielded up some\\nnovel secret to you?”\\n\\nWe were miles apart. But before I could reply, he showed me a\\nmanuscript open on the table and told me in a more serious tone:\\n\\n“Here, Professor Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several\\nlanguages. It contains a summary of my research under the sea, and God\\nwilling, it won’t perish with me. Signed with my name, complete with\\nmy life story, this manuscript will be enclosed in a small, unsinkable\\ncontrivance. The last surviving man on the Nautilus will throw this\\ncontrivance into the sea, and it will go wherever the waves carry it.”\\n\\nThe man’s name! His life story written by himself! So the secret of\\nhis existence might someday be unveiled? But just then I saw this\\nannouncement only as a lead-in to my topic.\\n\\n“Captain,” I replied, “I’m all praise for this idea you’re putting\\ninto effect. The fruits of your research must not be lost. But the\\nmethods you’re using strike me as primitive. Who knows where the winds\\nwill take that contrivance, into whose hands it may fall? Can’t you\\nfind something better? Can’t you or one of your men—”\\n\\n“Never, sir,” the captain said, swiftly interrupting me.\\n\\n“But my companions and I would be willing to safeguard this\\nmanuscript, and if you give us back our freedom—”\\n\\n“Your freedom!” Captain Nemo put in, standing up.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, and that’s the subject on which I wanted to confer with\\nyou. For seven months we’ve been aboard your vessel, and I ask you\\ntoday, in the name of my companions as well as myself, if you intend\\nto keep us here forever.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo said, “I’ll answer you today just as\\nI did seven months ago: whoever boards the Nautilus must never leave\\nit.”\\n\\n“What you’re inflicting on us is outright slavery!”\\n\\n“Call it anything you like.”\\n\\n“But every slave has the right to recover his freedom! By any\\nworthwhile, available means!”\\n\\n“Who has denied you that right?” Captain Nemo replied. “Did I ever try\\nto bind you with your word of honor?”\\n\\nThe captain stared at me, crossing his arms.\\n\\n“Sir,” I told him, “to take up this subject a second time would be\\ndistasteful to both of us. So let’s finish what we’ve started. I\\nrepeat: it isn’t just for myself that I raise this issue. To me,\\nresearch is a relief, a potent diversion, an enticement, a passion\\nthat can make me forget everything else. Like you, I’m a man neglected\\nand unknown, living in the faint hope that someday I can pass on to\\nfuture generations the fruits of my labors—figuratively speaking, by\\nmeans of some contrivance left to the luck of winds and waves. In\\nshort, I can admire you and comfortably go with you while playing a\\nrole I only partly understand; but I still catch glimpses of other\\naspects of your life that are surrounded by involvements and secrets\\nthat, alone on board, my companions and I can’t share. And even when\\nour hearts could beat with yours, moved by some of your griefs or\\nstirred by your deeds of courage and genius, we’ve had to stifle even\\nthe slightest token of that sympathy that arises at the sight of\\nsomething fine and good, whether it comes from friend or enemy. All\\nright then! It’s this feeling of being alien to your deepest concerns\\nthat makes our situation unacceptable, impossible, even impossible for\\nme but especially for Ned Land. Every man, by virtue of his very\\nhumanity, deserves fair treatment. Have you considered how a love of\\nfreedom and hatred of slavery could lead to plans of vengeance in a\\ntemperament like the Canadian’s, what he might think, attempt,\\nendeavor . . . ?”\\n\\nI fell silent. Captain Nemo stood up.\\n\\n“Ned Land can think, attempt, or endeavor anything he wants, what\\ndifference is it to me? I didn’t go looking for him! I don’t keep him\\non board for my pleasure! As for you, Professor Aronnax, you’re a man\\nable to understand anything, even silence. I have nothing more to say\\nto you. Let this first time you’ve come to discuss this subject also\\nbe the last, because a second time I won’t even listen.”\\n\\nI withdrew. From that day forward our position was very strained. I\\nreported this conversation to my two companions.\\n\\n“Now we know,” Ned said, “that we can’t expect a thing from this\\nman. The Nautilus is nearing Long Island. We’ll escape, no matter what\\nthe weather.”\\n\\nBut the skies became more and more threatening. There were conspicuous\\nsigns of a hurricane on the way. The atmosphere was turning white and\\nmilky. Slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon\\nby layers of nimbocumulus. Other low clouds fled swiftly. The sea grew\\ntowering, inflated by long swells. Every bird had disappeared except a\\nfew petrels, friends of the storms. The barometer fell significantly,\\nindicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze. The mixture\\nin our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity\\ncharging the air. A struggle of the elements was approaching.\\n\\nThe storm burst during the daytime of May 13, just as the Nautilus was\\ncruising abreast of Long Island, a few miles from the narrows to Upper\\nNew York Bay. I’m able to describe this struggle of the elements\\nbecause Captain Nemo didn’t flee into the ocean depths; instead, from\\nsome inexplicable whim, he decided to brave it out on the surface.\\n\\nThe wind was blowing from the southwest, initially a stiff breeze, in\\nother words, with a speed of fifteen meters per second, which built to\\ntwenty-five meters near three o’clock in the afternoon. This is the\\nfigure for major storms.\\n\\nUnshaken by these squalls, Captain Nemo stationed himself on the\\nplatform. He was lashed around the waist to withstand the monstrous\\nbreakers foaming over the deck. I hoisted and attached myself to the\\nsame place, dividing my wonderment between the storm and this\\nincomparable man who faced it head-on.\\n\\nThe raging sea was swept with huge tattered clouds drenched by the\\nwaves. I saw no more of the small intervening billows that form in the\\ntroughs of the big crests. Just long, soot-colored undulations with\\ncrests so compact they didn’t foam. They kept growing taller. They\\nwere spurring each other on. The Nautilus, sometimes lying on its\\nside, sometimes standing on end like a mast, rolled and pitched\\nfrightfully.\\n\\nNear five o’clock a torrential rain fell, but it lulled neither wind\\nnor sea. The hurricane was unleashed at a speed of forty-five meters\\nper second, hence almost forty leagues per hour. Under these\\nconditions houses topple, roof tiles puncture doors, iron railings\\nsnap in two, and twenty-four-pounder cannons relocate. And yet in the\\nmidst of this turmoil, the Nautilus lived up to that saying of an\\nexpert engineer: “A well-constructed hull can defy any sea!” This\\nsubmersible was no resisting rock that waves could demolish; it was a\\nsteel spindle, obediently in motion, without rigging or masting, and\\nable to brave their fury with impunity.\\n\\nMeanwhile I was carefully examining these unleashed breakers. They\\nmeasured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of 150 to 175\\nmeters, and the speed of their propagation (half that of the wind) was\\nfifteen meters per second. Their volume and power increased with the\\ndepth of the waters. I then understood the role played by these waves,\\nwhich trap air in their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea\\nwhere its oxygen brings life. Their utmost pressure—it has been\\ncalculated—can build to 3,000 kilograms on every square foot of\\nsurface they strike. It was such waves in the Hebrides that\\nrepositioned a stone block weighing 84,000 pounds. It was their\\nrelatives in the tidal wave on December 23, 1854, that toppled part of\\nthe Japanese city of Tokyo, then went that same day at 700 kilometers\\nper hour to break on the beaches of America.\\n\\nAfter nightfall the storm grew in intensity. As in the 1860 cyclone on\\nRΘunion Island, the barometer fell to 710 millimeters. At the close of\\nday, I saw a big ship passing on the horizon, struggling painfully. It\\nlay to at half steam in an effort to hold steady on the waves. It must\\nhave been a steamer on one of those lines out of New York to Liverpool\\nor Le Havre. It soon vanished into the shadows.\\n\\nAt ten o’clock in the evening, the skies caught on fire. The air was\\nstreaked with violent flashes of lightning. I couldn’t stand this\\nbrightness, but Captain Nemo stared straight at it, as if to inhale\\nthe spirit of the storm. A dreadful noise filled the air, a\\ncomplicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers, the howl\\nof the wind, claps of thunder. The wind shifted to every point of the\\nhorizon, and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing\\nthrough north, west, and south, moving in the opposite direction of\\nrevolving storms in the southern hemisphere.\\n\\nOh, that Gulf Stream! It truly lives up to its nickname, the Lord of\\nStorms! All by itself it creates these fearsome cyclones through the\\ndifference in temperature between its currents and the superimposed\\nlayers of air.\\n\\nThe rain was followed by a downpour of fire. Droplets of water changed\\ninto exploding tufts. You would have thought Captain Nemo was courting\\na death worthy of himself, seeking to be struck by lightning. In one\\nhideous pitching movement, the Nautilus reared its steel spur into the\\nair like a lightning rod, and I saw long sparks shoot down it.\\n\\nShattered, at the end of my strength, I slid flat on my belly to the\\nhatch. I opened it and went below to the lounge. By then the storm had\\nreached its maximum intensity. It was impossible to stand upright\\ninside the Nautilus.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo reentered near midnight. I could hear the ballast tanks\\nfilling little by little, and the Nautilus sank gently beneath the\\nsurface of the waves.\\n\\nThrough the lounge’s open windows, I saw large, frightened fish\\npassing like phantoms in the fiery waters. Some were struck by\\nlightning right before my eyes!\\n\\nThe Nautilus kept descending. I thought it would find calm again at\\nfifteen meters down. No. The upper strata were too violently\\nagitated. It needed to sink to fifty meters, searching for a resting\\nplace in the bowels of the sea.\\n\\nBut once there, what tranquility we found, what silence, what peace\\nall around us! Who would have known that a dreadful hurricane was then\\nunleashed on the surface of this ocean?\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\nIn Latitude 47° 24’ and Longitude 17° 28’\\n\\n\\nIN THE AFTERMATH of this storm, we were thrown back to the east. Away\\nwent any hope of escaping to the landing places of New York or the\\nSt. Lawrence. In despair, poor Ned went into seclusion like Captain\\nNemo. Conseil and I no longer left each other.\\n\\nAs I said, the Nautilus veered to the east. To be more accurate, I\\nshould have said to the northeast. Sometimes on the surface of the\\nwaves, sometimes beneath them, the ship wandered for days amid these\\nmists so feared by navigators. These are caused chiefly by melting\\nice, which keeps the air extremely damp. How many ships have perished\\nin these waterways as they tried to get directions from the hazy\\nlights on the coast! How many casualties have been caused by these\\nopaque mists! How many collisions have occurred with these reefs,\\nwhere the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind! How many\\nvessels have rammed each other, despite their running lights, despite\\nthe warnings given by their bosun’s pipes and alarm bells!\\n\\nSo the floor of this sea had the appearance of a battlefield where\\nevery ship defeated by the ocean still lay, some already old and\\nencrusted, others newer and reflecting our beacon light on their\\nironwork and copper undersides. Among these vessels, how many went\\ndown with all hands, with their crews and hosts of immigrants, at\\nthese trouble spots so prominent in the statistics: Cape Race,\\nSt. Paul Island, the Strait of Belle Isle, the St. Lawrence estuary!\\nAnd in only a few years, how many victims have been furnished to the\\nobituary notices by the Royal Mail, Inman, and Montreal lines; by\\nvessels named the Solway, the Isis, the Paramatta, the Hungarian, the\\nCanadian, the Anglo-Saxon, the Humboldt, and the United States, all\\nrun aground; by the Arctic and the Lyonnais, sunk in collisions; by\\nthe President, the Pacific, and the City of Glasgow, lost for reasons\\nunknown; in the midst of their gloomy rubble, the Nautilus navigated\\nas if passing the dead in review!\\n\\nBy May 15 we were off the southern tip of the Grand Banks of\\nNewfoundland. These banks are the result of marine sedimentation, an\\nextensive accumulation of organic waste brought either from the\\nequator by the Gulf Stream’s current, or from the North Pole by the\\ncountercurrent of cold water that skirts the American coast. Here,\\ntoo, erratically drifting chunks collect from the ice breakup. Here a\\nhuge boneyard forms from fish, mollusks, and zoophytes dying over it\\nby the billions.\\n\\nThe sea is of no great depth at the Grand Banks. A few hundred fathoms\\nat best. But to the south there is a deep, suddenly occurring\\ndepression, a 3,000-meter pit. Here the Gulf Stream widens. Its waters\\ncome to full bloom. It loses its speed and temperature, but it turns\\ninto a sea.\\n\\nAmong the fish that the Nautilus startled on its way, I’ll mention a\\none-meter lumpfish, blackish on top with orange on the belly and rare\\namong its brethren in that it practices monogamy, a good-sized\\neelpout, a type of emerald moray whose flavor is excellent, wolffish\\nwith big eyes in a head somewhat resembling a canine’s, viviparous\\nblennies whose eggs hatch inside their bodies like those of snakes,\\nbloated gobio (or black gudgeon) measuring two decimeters, grenadiers\\nwith long tails and gleaming with a silvery glow, speedy fish\\nventuring far from their High Arctic seas.\\n\\nOur nets also hauled in a bold, daring, vigorous, and muscular fish\\narmed with prickles on its head and stings on its fins, a real\\nscorpion measuring two to three meters, the ruthless enemy of cod,\\nblennies, and salmon; it was the bullhead of the northerly seas, a\\nfish with red fins and a brown body covered with nodules. The\\nNautilus’s fishermen had some trouble getting a grip on this animal,\\nwhich, thanks to the formation of its gill covers, can protect its\\nrespiratory organs from any parching contact with the air and can live\\nout of water for a good while.\\n\\nAnd I’ll mention—for the record—some little banded blennies that\\nfollow ships into the northernmost seas, sharp-snouted carp exclusive\\nto the north Atlantic, scorpionfish, and lastly the gadoid family,\\nchiefly the cod species, which I detected in their waters of choice\\nover these inexhaustible Grand Banks.\\n\\nBecause Newfoundland is simply an underwater peak, you could call\\nthese cod mountain fish. While the Nautilus was clearing a path\\nthrough their tight ranks, Conseil couldn’t refrain from making this\\ncomment:\\n\\n“Mercy, look at these cod!” he said. “Why, I thought cod were flat,\\nlike dab or sole!”\\n\\n“Innocent boy!” I exclaimed. “Cod are flat only at the grocery store,\\nwhere they’re cut open and spread out on display. But in the water\\nthey’re like mullet, spindle-shaped and perfectly built for speed.”\\n\\n“I can easily believe master,” Conseil replied. “But what crowds of\\nthem! What swarms!”\\n\\n“Bah! My friend, there’d be many more without their enemies,\\nscorpionfish and human beings! Do you know how many eggs have been\\ncounted in a single female?”\\n\\n“I’ll go all out,” Conseil replied. “500,000.”\\n\\n“11,000,000, my friend.”\\n\\n“11,000,000! I refuse to accept that until I count them myself.”\\n\\n“So count them, Conseil. But it would be less work to believe\\nme. Besides, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Americans, Danes, and Norwegians\\ncatch these cod by the thousands. They’re eaten in prodigious\\nquantities, and without the astonishing fertility of these fish, the\\nseas would soon be depopulated of them. Accordingly, in England and\\nAmerica alone, 5,000 ships manned by 75,000 seamen go after cod. Each\\nship brings back an average catch of 4,400 fish, making\\n22,000,000. Off the coast of Norway, the total is the same.”\\n\\n“Fine,” Conseil replied, “I’ll take master’s word for it. I won’t\\ncount them.”\\n\\n“Count what?”\\n\\n“Those 11,000,000 eggs. But I’ll make one comment.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“If all their eggs hatched, just four codfish could feed England,\\nAmerica, and Norway.”\\n\\nAs we skimmed the depths of the Grand Banks, I could see perfectly\\nthose long fishing lines, each armed with 200 hooks, that every boat\\ndangled by the dozens. The lower end of each line dragged the bottom\\nby means of a small grappling iron, and at the surface it was secured\\nto the buoy-rope of a cork float. The Nautilus had to maneuver\\nshrewdly in the midst of this underwater spiderweb.\\n\\nBut the ship didn’t stay long in these heavily traveled waterways. It\\nwent up to about latitude 42 degrees. This brought it abreast of\\nSt. John’s in Newfoundland and Heart’s Content, where the Atlantic\\nCable reaches its end point.\\n\\nInstead of continuing north, the Nautilus took an easterly heading, as\\nif to go along this plateau on which the telegraph cable rests, where\\nmultiple soundings have given the contours of the terrain with the\\nutmost accuracy.\\n\\nIt was on May 17, about 500 miles from Heart’s Content and 2,800\\nmeters down, that I spotted this cable lying on the seafloor. Conseil,\\nwhom I hadn’t alerted, mistook it at first for a gigantic sea snake\\nand was gearing up to classify it in his best manner. But I\\nenlightened the fine lad and let him down gently by giving him various\\ndetails on the laying of this cable.\\n\\nThe first cable was put down during the years 1857-1858; but after\\ntransmitting about 400 telegrams, it went dead. In 1863 engineers\\nbuilt a new cable that measured 3,400 kilometers, weighed 4,500 metric\\ntons, and was shipped aboard the Great Eastern. This attempt also\\nfailed.\\n\\nNow then, on May 25 while submerged to a depth of 3,836 meters, the\\nNautilus lay in precisely the locality where this second cable\\nsuffered the rupture that ruined the undertaking. It happened 638\\nmiles from the coast of Ireland. At around two o’clock in the\\nafternoon, all contact with Europe broke off. The electricians on\\nboard decided to cut the cable before fishing it up, and by eleven\\no’clock that evening they had retrieved the damaged part. They\\nrepaired the joint and its splice; then the cable was resubmerged. But\\na few days later it snapped again and couldn’t be recovered from the\\nocean depths.\\n\\nThese Americans refused to give up. The daring Cyrus Field, who had\\nrisked his whole fortune to promote this undertaking, called for a new\\nbond issue. It sold out immediately. Another cable was put down under\\nbetter conditions. Its sheaves of conducting wire were insulated\\nwithin a gutta-percha covering, which was protected by a padding of\\ntextile material enclosed in a metal sheath. The Great Eastern put\\nback to sea on July 13, 1866.\\n\\nThe operation proceeded apace. Yet there was one hitch. As they\\ngradually unrolled this third cable, the electricians observed on\\nseveral occasions that someone had recently driven nails into it,\\ntrying to damage its core. Captain Anderson, his officers, and the\\nengineers put their heads together, then posted a warning that if the\\nculprit were detected, he would be thrown overboard without a\\ntrial. After that, these villainous attempts were not repeated.\\n\\nBy July 23 the Great Eastern was lying no farther than 800 kilometers\\nfrom Newfoundland when it received telegraphed news from Ireland of an\\narmistice signed between Prussia and Austria after the Battle of\\nSadova. Through the mists on the 27th, it sighted the port of Heart’s\\nContent. The undertaking had ended happily, and in its first dispatch,\\nyoung America addressed old Europe with these wise words so rarely\\nunderstood: “Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of\\ngood will.”\\n\\nI didn’t expect to find this electric cable in mint condition, as it\\nlooked on leaving its place of manufacture. The long snake was covered\\nwith seashell rubble and bristling with foraminifera; a crust of caked\\ngravel protected it from any mollusks that might bore into it. It\\nrested serenely, sheltered from the sea’s motions, under a pressure\\nfavorable to the transmission of that electric spark that goes from\\nAmerica to Europe in 32/100 of a second. This cable will no doubt last\\nindefinitely because, as observers note, its gutta-percha casing is\\nimproved by a stay in salt water.\\n\\nBesides, on this well-chosen plateau, the cable never lies at depths\\nthat could cause a break. The Nautilus followed it to its lowest\\nreaches, located 4,431 meters down, and even there it rested without\\nany stress or strain. Then we returned to the locality where the 1863\\naccident had taken place.\\n\\nThere the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide, into which\\nyou could fit Mt. Blanc without its summit poking above the surface of\\nthe waves. This valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000\\nmeters high. We arrived there on May 28, and the Nautilus lay no\\nfarther than 150 kilometers from Ireland.\\n\\nWould Captain Nemo head up north and beach us on the British Isles?\\nNo. Much to my surprise, he went back down south and returned to\\nEuropean seas. As we swung around the Emerald Isle, I spotted Cape\\nClear for an instant, plus the lighthouse on Fastnet Rock that guides\\nall those thousands of ships setting out from Glasgow or Liverpool.\\n\\nAn important question then popped into my head. Would the Nautilus\\ndare to tackle the English Channel? Ned Land (who promptly reappeared\\nafter we hugged shore) never stopped questioning me. What could I\\nanswer him? Captain Nemo remained invisible. After giving the Canadian\\na glimpse of American shores, was he about to show me the coast of\\nFrance?\\n\\nBut the Nautilus kept gravitating southward. On May 30, in sight of\\nLand’s End, it passed between the lowermost tip of England and the\\nScilly Islands, which it left behind to starboard.\\n\\nIf it was going to enter the English Channel, it clearly needed to\\nhead east. It did not.\\n\\nAll day long on May 31, the Nautilus swept around the sea in a series\\nof circles that had me deeply puzzled. It seemed to be searching for a\\nlocality that it had some trouble finding. At noon Captain Nemo\\nhimself came to take our bearings. He didn’t address a word to me. He\\nlooked gloomier than ever. What was filling him with such sadness? Was\\nit our proximity to these European shores? Was he reliving his\\nmemories of that country he had left behind? If so, what did he feel?\\nRemorse or regret? For a good while these thoughts occupied my mind,\\nand I had a hunch that fate would soon give away the captain’s\\nsecrets.\\n\\nThe next day, June 1, the Nautilus kept to the same tack. It was\\nobviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean. Just as on\\nthe day before, Captain Nemo came to take the altitude of the sun. The\\nsea was smooth, the skies clear. Eight miles to the east, a big\\nsteamship was visible on the horizon line. No flag was flapping from\\nthe gaff of its fore-and-aft sail, and I couldn’t tell its\\nnationality.\\n\\nA few minutes before the sun passed its zenith, Captain Nemo raised\\nhis sextant and took his sights with the utmost precision. The\\nabsolute calm of the waves facilitated this operation. The Nautilus\\nlay motionless, neither rolling nor pitching.\\n\\nI was on the platform just then. After determining our position, the\\ncaptain pronounced only these words:\\n\\n“It’s right here!”\\n\\nHe went down the hatch. Had he seen that vessel change course and\\nseemingly head toward us? I’m unable to say.\\n\\nI returned to the lounge. The hatch closed, and I heard water hissing\\nin the ballast tanks. The Nautilus began to sink on a vertical line,\\nbecause its propeller was in check and no longer furnished any forward\\nmotion.\\n\\nSome minutes later it stopped at a depth of 833 meters and came to\\nrest on the seafloor.\\n\\nThe ceiling lights in the lounge then went out, the panels opened, and\\nthrough the windows I saw, for a half-mile radius, the sea brightly\\nlit by the beacon’s rays.\\n\\nI looked to port and saw nothing but the immenseness of these tranquil\\nwaters.\\n\\nTo starboard, a prominent bulge on the sea bottom caught my\\nattention. You would have thought it was some ruin enshrouded in a\\ncrust of whitened seashells, as if under a mantle of snow. Carefully\\nexamining this mass, I could identify the swollen outlines of a ship\\nshorn of its masts, which must have sunk bow first. This casualty\\ncertainly dated from some far-off time. To be so caked with the\\nlimestone of these waters, this wreckage must have spent many a year\\non the ocean floor.\\n\\nWhat ship was this? Why had the Nautilus come to visit its grave? Was\\nit something other than a maritime accident that had dragged this\\ncraft under the waters?\\n\\nI wasn’t sure what to think, but next to me I heard Captain Nemo’s\\nvoice slowly say:\\n\\n“Originally this ship was christened the Marseillais. It carried\\nseventy-four cannons and was launched in 1762. On August 13, 1778,\\ncommanded by La Poype-Vertrieux, it fought valiantly against the\\nPreston. On July 4, 1779, as a member of the squadron under Admiral\\nd’Estaing, it assisted in the capture of the island of Grenada. On\\nSeptember 5, 1781, under the Count de Grasse, it took part in the\\nBattle of Chesapeake Bay. In 1794 the new Republic of France changed\\nthe name of this ship. On April 16 of that same year, it joined the\\nsquadron at Brest under Rear Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, who was\\nentrusted with escorting a convoy of wheat coming from America under\\nthe command of Admiral Van Stabel. In this second year of the French\\nRevolutionary Calendar, on the 11th and 12th days in the Month of\\nPasture, this squadron fought an encounter with English vessels. Sir,\\ntoday is June 1, 1868, or the 13th day in the Month of\\nPasture. Seventy-four years ago to the day, at this very spot in\\nlatitude 47 degrees 24’ and longitude 17 degrees 28’, this ship sank\\nafter a heroic battle; its three masts gone, water in its hold, a\\nthird of its crew out of action, it preferred to go to the bottom with\\nits 356 seamen rather than surrender; and with its flag nailed up on\\nthe afterdeck, it disappeared beneath the waves to shouts of ‘Long\\nlive the Republic!’”\\n\\n“This is the Avenger!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, sir! The Avenger! A splendid name!” Captain Nemo murmured,\\ncrossing his arms.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\nA Mass Execution\\n\\n\\nTHE WAY HE SAID THIS, the unexpectedness of this scene, first the\\nbiography of this patriotic ship, then the excitement with which this\\neccentric individual pronounced these last words—the name Avenger\\nwhose significance could not escape me—all this, taken together, had a\\nprofound impact on my mind. My eyes never left the captain. Hands\\noutstretched toward the sea, he contemplated the proud wreck with\\nblazing eyes. Perhaps I would never learn who he was, where he came\\nfrom or where he was heading, but more and more I could see a\\ndistinction between the man and the scientist. It was no ordinary\\nmisanthropy that kept Captain Nemo and his companions sequestered\\ninside the Nautilus’s plating, but a hate so monstrous or so sublime\\nthat the passing years could never weaken it.\\n\\nDid this hate also hunger for vengeance? Time would soon tell.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Nautilus rose slowly to the surface of the sea, and I\\nwatched the Avenger’s murky shape disappearing little by little. Soon\\na gentle rolling told me that we were afloat in the open air.\\n\\nJust then a hollow explosion was audible. I looked at the captain. The\\ncaptain did not stir.\\n\\n“Captain?” I said.\\n\\nHe didn’t reply.\\n\\nI left him and climbed onto the platform. Conseil and the Canadian\\nwere already there.\\n\\n“What caused that explosion?” I asked.\\n\\n“A cannon going off,” Ned Land replied.\\n\\nI stared in the direction of the ship I had spotted. It was heading\\ntoward the Nautilus, and you could tell it had put on steam. Six miles\\nseparated it from us.\\n\\n“What sort of craft is it, Ned?”\\n\\n“From its rigging and its low masts,” the Canadian replied, “I bet\\nit’s a warship. Here’s hoping it pulls up and sinks this damned\\nNautilus!”\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” Conseil replied, “what harm could it do the Nautilus?\\nWill it attack us under the waves? Will it cannonade us at the bottom\\nof the sea?”\\n\\n“Tell me, Ned,” I asked, “can you make out the nationality of that\\ncraft?”\\n\\nCreasing his brow, lowering his lids, and puckering the corners of his\\neyes, the Canadian focused the full power of his gaze on the ship for\\na short while.\\n\\n“No, sir,” he replied. “I can’t make out what nation it’s from. It’s\\nflying no flag. But I’ll swear it’s a warship, because there’s a long\\npennant streaming from the peak of its mainmast.”\\n\\nFor a quarter of an hour, we continued to watch the craft bearing down\\non us. But it was inconceivable to me that it had discovered the\\nNautilus at such a distance, still less that it knew what this\\nunderwater machine really was.\\n\\nSoon the Canadian announced that the craft was a big battleship, a\\ndouble-decker ironclad complete with ram. Dark, dense smoke burst from\\nits two funnels. Its furled sails merged with the lines of its\\nyardarms. The gaff of its fore-and-aft sail flew no flag. Its distance\\nstill kept us from distinguishing the colors of its pennant, which was\\nfluttering like a thin ribbon.\\n\\nIt was coming on fast. If Captain Nemo let it approach, a chance for\\nsalvation might be available to us.\\n\\n“Sir,” Ned Land told me, “if that boat gets within a mile of us, I’m\\njumping overboard, and I suggest you follow suit.”\\n\\nI didn’t reply to the Canadian’s proposition but kept watching the\\nship, which was looming larger on the horizon. Whether it was English,\\nFrench, American, or Russian, it would surely welcome us aboard if we\\ncould just get to it.\\n\\n“Master may recall,” Conseil then said, “that we have some experience\\nwith swimming. He can rely on me to tow him to that vessel, if he’s\\nagreeable to going with our friend Ned.”\\n\\nBefore I could reply, white smoke streamed from the battleship’s\\nbow. Then, a few seconds later, the waters splashed astern of the\\nNautilus, disturbed by the fall of a heavy object. Soon after, an\\nexplosion struck my ears.\\n\\n“What’s this? They’re firing at us!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Good lads!” the Canadian muttered.\\n\\n“That means they don’t see us as castaways clinging to some wreckage!”\\n\\n“With all due respect to master—gracious!” Conseil put in, shaking off\\nthe water that had sprayed over him from another shell. “With all due\\nrespect to master, they’ve discovered the narwhale and they’re\\ncannonading the same.”\\n\\n“But it must be clear to them,” I exclaimed, “that they’re dealing\\nwith human beings.”\\n\\n“Maybe that’s why!” Ned Land replied, staring hard at me.\\n\\nThe full truth dawned on me. Undoubtedly people now knew where they\\nstood on the existence of this so-called monster. Undoubtedly the\\nlatter’s encounter with the Abraham Lincoln, when the Canadian hit it\\nwith his harpoon, had led Commander Farragut to recognize the narwhale\\nas actually an underwater boat, more dangerous than any unearthly\\ncetacean!\\n\\nYes, this had to be the case, and undoubtedly they were now chasing\\nthis dreadful engine of destruction on every sea!\\n\\nDreadful indeed, if, as we could assume, Captain Nemo had been using\\nthe Nautilus in works of vengeance! That night in the middle of the\\nIndian Ocean, when he imprisoned us in the cell, hadn’t he attacked\\nsome ship? That man now buried in the coral cemetery, wasn’t he the\\nvictim of some collision caused by the Nautilus? Yes, I repeat: this\\nhad to be the case. One part of Captain Nemo’s secret life had been\\nunveiled. And now, even though his identity was still unknown, at\\nleast the nations allied against him knew they were no longer hunting\\nsome fairy-tale monster, but a man who had sworn an implacable hate\\ntoward them!\\n\\nThis whole fearsome sequence of events appeared in my mind’s\\neye. Instead of encountering friends on this approaching ship, we\\nwould find only pitiless enemies.\\n\\nMeanwhile shells fell around us in increasing numbers. Some, meeting\\nthe liquid surface, would ricochet and vanish into the sea at\\nconsiderable distances. But none of them reached the Nautilus.\\n\\nBy then the ironclad was no more than three miles off. Despite its\\nviolent cannonade, Captain Nemo hadn’t appeared on the platform. And\\nyet if one of those conical shells had scored a routine hit on the\\nNautilus’s hull, it could have been fatal to him.\\n\\nThe Canadian then told me:\\n\\n“Sir, we’ve got to do everything we can to get out of this jam! Let’s\\nsignal them! Damnation! Maybe they’ll realize we’re decent people!”\\n\\nNed Land pulled out his handkerchief to wave it in the air. But he had\\nbarely unfolded it when he was felled by an iron fist, and despite his\\ngreat strength, he tumbled to the deck.\\n\\n“Scum!” the captain shouted. “Do you want to be nailed to the\\nNautilus’s spur before it charges that ship?”\\n\\nDreadful to hear, Captain Nemo was even more dreadful to see. His face\\nwas pale from some spasm of his heart, which must have stopped beating\\nfor an instant. His pupils were hideously contracted. His voice was no\\nlonger speaking, it was bellowing. Bending from the waist, he shook\\nthe Canadian by the shoulders.\\n\\nThen, dropping Ned and turning to the battleship, whose shells were\\nshowering around him:\\n\\n“O ship of an accursed nation, you know who I am!” he shouted in his\\npowerful voice. “And I don’t need your colors to recognize you! Look!\\nI’ll show you mine!”\\n\\nAnd in the bow of the platform, Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag,\\nlike the one he had left planted at the South Pole.\\n\\nJust then a shell hit the Nautilus’s hull obliquely, failed to breach\\nit, ricocheted near the captain, and vanished into the sea.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo shrugged his shoulders. Then, addressing me:\\n\\n“Go below!” he told me in a curt tone. “You and your companions, go\\nbelow!”\\n\\n“Sir,” I exclaimed, “are you going to attack this ship?”\\n\\n“Sir, I’m going to sink it.”\\n\\n“You wouldn’t!”\\n\\n“I will,” Captain Nemo replied icily. “You’re ill-advised to pass\\njudgment on me, sir. Fate has shown you what you weren’t meant to\\nsee. The attack has come. Our reply will be dreadful. Get back\\ninside!”\\n\\n“From what country is that ship?”\\n\\n“You don’t know? Fine, so much the better! At least its nationality\\nwill remain a secret to you. Go below!”\\n\\nThe Canadian, Conseil, and I could only obey. Some fifteen of the\\nNautilus’s seamen surrounded their captain and stared with a feeling\\nof implacable hate at the ship bearing down on them. You could feel\\nthe same spirit of vengeance enkindling their every soul.\\n\\nI went below just as another projectile scraped the Nautilus’s hull,\\nand I heard the captain exclaim:\\n\\n“Shoot, you demented vessel! Shower your futile shells! You won’t\\nescape the Nautilus’s spur! But this isn’t the place where you’ll\\nperish! I don’t want your wreckage mingling with that of the Avenger!”\\n\\nI repaired to my stateroom. The captain and his chief officer stayed\\non the platform. The propeller was set in motion. The Nautilus swiftly\\nretreated, putting us outside the range of the vessel’s shells. But\\nthe chase continued, and Captain Nemo was content to keep his\\ndistance.\\n\\nNear four o’clock in the afternoon, unable to control the impatience\\nand uneasiness devouring me, I went back to the central\\ncompanionway. The hatch was open. I ventured onto the platform. The\\ncaptain was still strolling there, his steps agitated. He stared at\\nthe ship, which stayed to his leeward five or six miles off. He was\\ncircling it like a wild beast, drawing it eastward, letting it chase\\nafter him. Yet he didn’t attack. Was he, perhaps, still undecided?\\n\\nI tried to intervene one last time. But I had barely queried Captain\\nNemo when the latter silenced me:\\n\\n“I’m the law, I’m the tribunal! I’m the oppressed, and there are my\\noppressors! Thanks to them, I’ve witnessed the destruction of\\neverything I loved, cherished, and venerated—homeland, wife, children,\\nfather, and mother! There lies everything I hate! Not another word out\\nof you!”\\n\\nI took a last look at the battleship, which was putting on steam. Then\\nI rejoined Ned and Conseil.\\n\\n“We’ll escape!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Good,” Ned put in. “Where’s that ship from?”\\n\\n“I’ve no idea. But wherever it’s from, it will sink before\\nnightfall. In any event, it’s better to perish with it than be\\naccomplices in some act of revenge whose merits we can’t gauge.”\\n\\n“That’s my feeling,” Ned Land replied coolly. “Let’s wait for\\nnightfall.”\\n\\nNight fell. A profound silence reigned on board. The compass indicated\\nthat the Nautilus hadn’t changed direction. I could hear the beat of\\nits propeller, churning the waves with steady speed. Staying on the\\nsurface of the water, it rolled gently, sometimes to one side,\\nsometimes to the other.\\n\\nMy companions and I had decided to escape as soon as the vessel came\\nclose enough for us to be heard—or seen, because the moon would wax\\nfull in three days and was shining brightly. Once we were aboard that\\nship, if we couldn’t ward off the blow that threatened it, at least we\\ncould do everything that circumstances permitted. Several times I\\nthought the Nautilus was about to attack. But it was content to let\\nits adversary approach, and then it would quickly resume its\\nretreating ways.\\n\\nPart of the night passed without incident. We kept watch for an\\nopportunity to take action. We talked little, being too keyed up. Ned\\nLand was all for jumping overboard. I forced him to wait. As I saw it,\\nthe Nautilus would attack the double-decker on the surface of the\\nwaves, and then it would be not only possible but easy to escape.\\n\\nAt three o’clock in the morning, full of uneasiness, I climbed onto\\nthe platform. Captain Nemo hadn’t left it. He stood in the bow next to\\nhis flag, which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head. His eyes\\nnever left that vessel. The extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed\\nto attract it, beguile it, and draw it more surely than if he had it\\nin tow!\\n\\nThe moon then passed its zenith. Jupiter was rising in the east. In\\nthe midst of this placid natural setting, sky and ocean competed with\\neach other in tranquility, and the sea offered the orb of night the\\nloveliest mirror ever to reflect its image.\\n\\nAnd when I compared this deep calm of the elements with all the fury\\nseething inside the plating of this barely perceptible Nautilus, I\\nshivered all over.\\n\\nThe vessel was two miles off. It drew nearer, always moving toward the\\nphosphorescent glow that signaled the Nautilus’s presence. I saw its\\ngreen and red running lights, plus the white lantern hanging from the\\nlarge stay of its foremast. Hazy flickerings were reflected on its\\nrigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the\\nlimit. Showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its\\nfunnels, spangling the air with stars.\\n\\nI stood there until six o’clock in the morning, Captain Nemo never\\nseeming to notice me. The vessel lay a mile and a half off, and with\\nthe first glimmers of daylight, it resumed its cannonade. The time\\ncouldn’t be far away when the Nautilus would attack its adversary, and\\nmy companions and I would leave forever this man I dared not judge.\\n\\nI was about to go below to alert them, when the chief officer climbed\\nonto the platform. Several seamen were with him. Captain Nemo didn’t\\nsee them, or didn’t want to see them. They carried out certain\\nprocedures that, on the Nautilus, you could call “clearing the decks\\nfor action.” They were quite simple. The manropes that formed a\\nhandrail around the platform were lowered. Likewise the pilothouse and\\nthe beacon housing were withdrawn into the hull until they lay exactly\\nflush with it. The surface of this long sheet-iron cigar no longer\\noffered a single protrusion that could hamper its maneuvers.\\n\\nI returned to the lounge. The Nautilus still emerged above the\\nsurface. A few morning gleams infiltrated the liquid strata. Beneath\\nthe undulations of the billows, the windows were enlivened by the\\nblushing of the rising sun. That dreadful day of June 2 had dawned.\\n\\nAt seven o’clock the log told me that the Nautilus had reduced\\nspeed. I realized that it was letting the warship approach. Moreover,\\nthe explosions grew more intensely audible. Shells furrowed the water\\naround us, drilling through it with an odd hissing sound.\\n\\n“My friends,” I said, “it’s time. Let’s shake hands, and may God be\\nwith us!”\\n\\nNed Land was determined, Conseil calm, I myself nervous and barely in\\ncontrol.\\n\\nWe went into the library. Just as I pushed open the door leading to\\nthe well of the central companionway, I heard the hatch close sharply\\noverhead.\\n\\nThe Canadian leaped up the steps, but I stopped him. A well-known\\nhissing told me that water was entering the ship’s ballast\\ntanks. Indeed, in a few moments the Nautilus had submerged some meters\\nbelow the surface of the waves.\\n\\nI understood this maneuver. It was too late to take action. The\\nNautilus wasn’t going to strike the double-decker where it was clad in\\nimpenetrable iron armor, but below its waterline, where the metal\\ncarapace no longer protected its planking.\\n\\nWe were prisoners once more, unwilling spectators at the performance\\nof this gruesome drama. But we barely had time to think. Taking refuge\\nin my stateroom, we stared at each other without pronouncing a\\nword. My mind was in a total daze. My mental processes came to a dead\\nstop. I hovered in that painful state that predominates during the\\nperiod of anticipation before some frightful explosion. I waited, I\\nlistened, I lived only through my sense of hearing!\\n\\nMeanwhile the Nautilus’s speed had increased appreciably. So it was\\ngathering momentum. Its entire hull was vibrating.\\n\\nSuddenly I let out a yell. There had been a collision, but it was\\ncomparatively mild. I could feel the penetrating force of the steel\\nspur. I could hear scratchings and scrapings. Carried away with its\\ndriving power, the Nautilus had passed through the vessel’s mass like\\na sailmaker’s needle through canvas!\\n\\nI couldn’t hold still. Frantic, going insane, I leaped out of my\\nstateroom and rushed into the lounge.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was there. Mute, gloomy, implacable, he was staring\\nthrough the port panel.\\n\\nAn enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters, and the Nautilus,\\nmissing none of its death throes, was descending into the depths with\\nit. Ten meters away, I could see its gaping hull, into which water was\\nrushing with a sound of thunder, then its double rows of cannons and\\nrailings. Its deck was covered with dark, quivering shadows.\\n\\nThe water was rising. Those poor men leaped up into the shrouds, clung\\nto the masts, writhed beneath the waters. It was a human anthill that\\nan invading sea had caught by surprise!\\n\\nParalyzed, rigid with anguish, my hair standing on end, my eyes\\npopping out of my head, short of breath, suffocating, speechless, I\\nstared—I too! I was glued to the window by an irresistible allure!\\n\\nThe enormous vessel settled slowly. Following it down, the Nautilus\\nkept watch on its every movement. Suddenly there was an eruption. The\\nair compressed inside the craft sent its decks flying, as if the\\npowder stores had been ignited. The thrust of the waters was so great,\\nthe Nautilus swerved away.\\n\\nThe poor ship then sank more swiftly. Its mastheads appeared, laden\\nwith victims, then its crosstrees bending under clusters of men,\\nfinally the peak of its mainmast. Then the dark mass disappeared, and\\nwith it a crew of corpses dragged under by fearsome eddies. . . .\\n\\nI turned to Captain Nemo. This dreadful executioner, this true\\narchangel of hate, was still staring. When it was all over, Captain\\nNemo headed to the door of his stateroom, opened it, and entered. I\\nfollowed him with my eyes.\\n\\nOn the rear paneling, beneath the portraits of his heroes, I saw the\\nportrait of a still-youthful woman with two little children. Captain\\nNemo stared at them for a few moments, stretched out his arms to them,\\nsank to his knees, and melted into sobs.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\nThe Last Words of Captain Nemo\\n\\n\\nTHE PANELS CLOSED over this frightful view, but the lights didn’t go\\non in the lounge. Inside the Nautilus all was gloom and silence. It\\nleft this place of devastation with prodigious speed, 100 feet beneath\\nthe waters. Where was it going? North or south? Where would the man\\nflee after this horrible act of revenge?\\n\\nI reentered my stateroom, where Ned and Conseil were waiting\\nsilently. Captain Nemo filled me with insurmountable horror. Whatever\\nhe had once suffered at the hands of humanity, he had no right to mete\\nout such punishment. He had made me, if not an accomplice, at least an\\neyewitness to his vengeance! Even this was intolerable.\\n\\nAt eleven o’clock the electric lights came back on. I went into the\\nlounge. It was deserted. I consulted the various instruments. The\\nNautilus was fleeing northward at a speed of twenty-five miles per\\nhour, sometimes on the surface of the sea, sometimes thirty feet\\nbeneath it.\\n\\nAfter our position had been marked on the chart, I saw that we were\\npassing into the mouth of the English Channel, that our heading would\\ntake us to the northernmost seas with incomparable speed.\\n\\nI could barely glimpse the swift passing of longnose sharks,\\nhammerhead sharks, spotted dogfish that frequent these waters, big\\neagle rays, swarms of seahorse looking like knights on a chessboard,\\neels quivering like fireworks serpents, armies of crab that fled\\nobliquely by crossing their pincers over their carapaces, finally\\nschools of porpoise that held contests of speed with the Nautilus. But\\nby this point observing, studying, and classifying were out of the\\nquestion.\\n\\nBy evening we had cleared 200 leagues up the Atlantic. Shadows\\ngathered and gloom overran the sea until the moon came up.\\n\\nI repaired to my stateroom. I couldn’t sleep. I was assaulted by\\nnightmares. That horrible scene of destruction kept repeating in my\\nmind’s eye.\\n\\nFrom that day forward, who knows where the Nautilus took us in the\\nnorth Atlantic basin? Always at incalculable speed! Always amid the\\nHigh Arctic mists! Did it call at the capes of Spitzbergen or the\\nshores of Novaya Zemlya? Did it visit such uncharted seas as the White\\nSea, the Kara Sea, the Gulf of Ob, the Lyakhov Islands, or those\\nunknown beaches on the Siberian coast? I’m unable to say. I lost track\\nof the passing hours. Time was in abeyance on the ship’s clocks. As\\nhappens in the polar regions, it seemed that night and day no longer\\nfollowed their normal sequence. I felt myself being drawn into that\\nstrange domain where the overwrought imagination of Edgar Allan Poe\\nwas at home. Like his fabled Arthur Gordon Pym, I expected any moment\\nto see that “shrouded human figure, very far larger in its proportions\\nthan any dweller among men,” thrown across the cataract that protects\\nthe outskirts of the pole!\\n\\nI estimate—but perhaps I’m mistaken—that the Nautilus’s haphazard\\ncourse continued for fifteen or twenty days, and I’m not sure how long\\nthis would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our\\nvoyage. As for Captain Nemo, he was no longer in the picture. As for\\nhis chief officer, the same applied. Not one crewman was visible for a\\nsingle instant. The Nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost\\ncontinuously. When it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air,\\nthe hatches opened and closed as if automated. No more positions were\\nreported on the world map. I didn’t know where we were.\\n\\nI’ll also mention that the Canadian, at the end of his strength and\\npatience, made no further appearances. Conseil couldn’t coax a single\\nword out of him and feared that, in a fit of delirium while under the\\nsway of a ghastly homesickness, Ned would kill himself. So he kept a\\ndevoted watch on his friend every instant.\\n\\nYou can appreciate that under these conditions, our situation had\\nbecome untenable.\\n\\nOne morning—whose date I’m unable to specify—I was slumbering near the\\nfirst hours of daylight, a painful, sickly slumber. Waking up, I saw\\nNed Land leaning over me, and I heard him tell me in a low voice:\\n\\n“We’re going to escape!”\\n\\nI sat up.\\n\\n“When?” I asked.\\n\\n“Tonight. There doesn’t seem to be any supervision left on the\\nNautilus. You’d think a total daze was reigning on board. Will you be\\nready, sir?”\\n\\n“Yes. Where are we?”\\n\\n“In sight of land. I saw it through the mists just this morning,\\ntwenty miles to the east.”\\n\\n“What land is it?”\\n\\n“I’ve no idea, but whatever it is, there we’ll take refuge.”\\n\\n“Yes, Ned! We’ll escape tonight even if the sea swallows us up!”\\n\\n“The sea’s rough, the wind’s blowing hard, but a twenty-mile run in\\nthe Nautilus’s nimble longboat doesn’t scare me. Unknown to the crew,\\nI’ve stowed some food and flasks of water inside.”\\n\\n“I’m with you.”\\n\\n“What’s more,” the Canadian added, “if they catch me, I’ll defend\\nmyself, I’ll fight to the death.”\\n\\n“Then we’ll die together, Ned my friend.”\\n\\nMy mind was made up. The Canadian left me. I went out on the platform,\\nwhere I could barely stand upright against the jolts of the\\nbillows. The skies were threatening, but land lay inside those dense\\nmists, and we had to escape. Not a single day, or even a single hour,\\ncould we afford to lose.\\n\\nI returned to the lounge, dreading yet desiring an encounter with\\nCaptain Nemo, wanting yet not wanting to see him. What would I say to\\nhim? How could I hide the involuntary horror he inspired in me? No! It\\nwas best not to meet him face to face! Best to try and forget him! And\\nyet . . . !\\n\\nHow long that day seemed, the last I would spend aboard the Nautilus!\\nI was left to myself. Ned Land and Conseil avoided speaking to me,\\nafraid they would give themselves away.\\n\\nAt six o’clock I ate supper, but I had no appetite. Despite my\\nrevulsion, I forced it down, wanting to keep my strength up.\\n\\nAt 6:30 Ned Land entered my stateroom. He told me:\\n\\n“We won’t see each other again before we go. At ten o’clock the moon\\nwon’t be up yet. We’ll take advantage of the darkness. Come to the\\nskiff. Conseil and I will be inside waiting for you.”\\n\\nThe Canadian left without giving me time to answer him.\\n\\nI wanted to verify the Nautilus’s heading. I made my way to the\\nlounge. We were racing north-northeast with frightful speed, fifty\\nmeters down.\\n\\nI took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures\\namassed in the museum, this unrivaled collection doomed to perish\\nsomeday in the depths of the seas, together with its curator. I wanted\\nto establish one supreme impression in my mind. I stayed there an\\nhour, basking in the aura of the ceiling lights, passing in review the\\ntreasures shining in their glass cases. Then I returned to my\\nstateroom.\\n\\nThere I dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes. I gathered my notes and\\npacked them tenderly about my person. My heart was pounding\\nmightily. I couldn’t curb its pulsations. My anxiety and agitation\\nwould certainly have given me away if Captain Nemo had seen me.\\n\\nWhat was he doing just then? I listened at the door to his\\nstateroom. I heard the sound of footsteps. Captain Nemo was inside. He\\nhadn’t gone to bed. With his every movement I imagined he would appear\\nand ask me why I wanted to escape! I felt in a perpetual state of\\nalarm. My imagination magnified this sensation. The feeling became so\\nacute, I wondered whether it wouldn’t be better to enter the captain’s\\nstateroom, dare him face to face, brave it out with word and deed!\\n\\nIt was an insane idea. Fortunately I controlled myself and stretched\\nout on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation. My nerves calmed a\\nlittle, but with my brain so aroused, I did a swift review of my whole\\nexistence aboard the Nautilus, every pleasant or unpleasant incident\\nthat had crossed my path since I went overboard from the Abraham\\nLincoln: the underwater hunting trip, the Torres Strait, our running\\naground, the savages of Papua, the coral cemetery, the Suez\\npassageway, the island of Santorini, the Cretan diver, the Bay of\\nVigo, Atlantis, the Ice Bank, the South Pole, our imprisonment in the\\nice, the battle with the devilfish, the storm in the Gulf Stream, the\\nAvenger, and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew\\n. . . ! All these events passed before my eyes like backdrops\\nunrolling upstage in a theater. In this strange setting Captain Nemo\\nthen grew fantastically. His features were accentuated, taking on\\nsuperhuman proportions. He was no longer my equal, he was the Man of\\nthe Waters, the Spirit of the Seas.\\n\\nBy then it was 9:30. I held my head in both hands to keep it from\\nbursting. I closed my eyes. I no longer wanted to think. A half hour\\nstill to wait! A half hour of nightmares that could drive me insane!\\n\\nJust then I heard indistinct chords from the organ, melancholy\\nharmonies from some undefinable hymn, actual pleadings from a soul\\ntrying to sever its earthly ties. I listened with all my senses at\\nonce, barely breathing, immersed like Captain Nemo in this musical\\ntrance that was drawing him beyond the bounds of this world.\\n\\nThen a sudden thought terrified me. Captain Nemo had left his\\nstateroom. He was in the same lounge I had to cross in order to\\nescape. There I would encounter him one last time. He would see me,\\nperhaps speak to me! One gesture from him could obliterate me, a\\nsingle word shackle me to his vessel!\\n\\nEven so, ten o’clock was about to strike. It was time to leave my\\nstateroom and rejoin my companions.\\n\\nI dared not hesitate, even if Captain Nemo stood before me. I opened\\nthe door cautiously, but as it swung on its hinges, it seemed to make\\na frightful noise. This noise existed, perhaps, only in my\\nimagination!\\n\\nI crept forward through the Nautilus’s dark gangways, pausing after\\neach step to curb the pounding of my heart.\\n\\nI arrived at the corner door of the lounge. I opened it gently. The\\nlounge was plunged in profound darkness. Chords from the organ were\\nreverberating faintly. Captain Nemo was there. He didn’t see me. Even\\nin broad daylight I doubt that he would have noticed me, so completely\\nwas he immersed in his trance.\\n\\nI inched over the carpet, avoiding the tiniest bump whose noise might\\ngive me away. It took me five minutes to reach the door at the far\\nend, which led into the library.\\n\\nI was about to open it when a gasp from Captain Nemo nailed me to the\\nspot. I realized that he was standing up. I even got a glimpse of him\\nbecause some rays of light from the library had filtered into the\\nlounge. He was coming toward me, arms crossed, silent, not walking but\\ngliding like a ghost. His chest was heaving, swelling with sobs. And I\\nheard him murmur these words, the last of his to reach my ears:\\n\\n“O almighty God! Enough! Enough!”\\n\\nWas it a vow of repentance that had just escaped from this man’s\\nconscience . . . ?\\n\\nFrantic, I rushed into the library. I climbed the central\\ncompanionway, and going along the upper gangway, I arrived at the\\nskiff. I went through the opening that had already given access to my\\ntwo companions.\\n\\n“Let’s go, let’s go!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Right away!” the Canadian replied.\\n\\nFirst, Ned Land closed and bolted the opening cut into the Nautilus’s\\nsheet iron, using the monkey wrench he had with him. After likewise\\nclosing the opening in the skiff, the Canadian began to unscrew the\\nnuts still bolting us to the underwater boat.\\n\\nSuddenly a noise from the ship’s interior became audible. Voices were\\nanswering each other hurriedly. What was it? Had they spotted our\\nescape? I felt Ned Land sliding a dagger into my hand.\\n\\n“Yes,” I muttered, “we know how to die!”\\n\\nThe Canadian paused in his work. But one word twenty times repeated,\\none dreadful word, told me the reason for the agitation spreading\\naboard the Nautilus. We weren’t the cause of the crew’s concern.\\n\\n“Maelstrom! Maelstrom!” they were shouting.\\n\\nThe Maelstrom! Could a more frightening name have rung in our ears\\nunder more frightening circumstances? Were we lying in the dangerous\\nwaterways off the Norwegian coast? Was the Nautilus being dragged into\\nthis whirlpool just as the skiff was about to detach from its plating?\\n\\nAs you know, at the turn of the tide, the waters confined between the\\nFaroe and Lofoten Islands rush out with irresistible violence. They\\nform a vortex from which no ship has ever been able to\\nescape. Monstrous waves race together from every point of the\\nhorizon. They form a whirlpool aptly called “the ocean’s navel,” whose\\nattracting power extends a distance of fifteen kilometers. It can suck\\ndown not only ships but whales, and even polar bears from the\\nnorthernmost regions.\\n\\nThis was where the Nautilus had been sent accidentally—or perhaps\\ndeliberately—by its captain. It was sweeping around in a spiral whose\\nradius kept growing smaller and smaller. The skiff, still attached to\\nthe ship’s plating, was likewise carried around at dizzying speed. I\\ncould feel us whirling. I was experiencing that accompanying nausea\\nthat follows such continuous spinning motions. We were in dread, in\\nthe last stages of sheer horror, our blood frozen in our veins, our\\nnerves numb, drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying!\\nAnd what a noise around our frail skiff! What roars echoing from\\nseveral miles away! What crashes from the waters breaking against\\nsharp rocks on the seafloor, where the hardest objects are smashed,\\nwhere tree trunks are worn down and worked into “a shaggy fur,” as\\nNorwegians express it!\\n\\nWhat a predicament! We were rocking frightfully. The Nautilus defended\\nitself like a human being. Its steel muscles were cracking. Sometimes\\nit stood on end, the three of us along with it!\\n\\n“We’ve got to hold on tight,” Ned said, “and screw the nuts down\\nagain! If we can stay attached to the Nautilus, we can still make it\\n. . . !”\\n\\nHe hadn’t finished speaking when a cracking sound occurred. The nuts\\ngave way, and ripped out of its socket, the skiff was hurled like a\\nstone from a sling into the midst of the vortex.\\n\\nMy head struck against an iron timber, and with this violent shock I\\nlost consciousness.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n\\nWE COME TO the conclusion of this voyage under the seas. What happened\\nthat night, how the skiff escaped from the Maelstrom’s fearsome\\neddies, how Ned Land, Conseil, and I got out of that whirlpool, I’m\\nunable to say. But when I regained consciousness, I was lying in a\\nfisherman’s hut on one of the Lofoten Islands. My two companions, safe\\nand sound, were at my bedside clasping my hands. We embraced each\\nother heartily.\\n\\nJust now we can’t even dream of returning to France. Travel between\\nupper Norway and the south is limited. So I have to wait for the\\narrival of a steamboat that provides bimonthly service from North\\nCape.\\n\\nSo it is here, among these gallant people who have taken us in, that\\nI’m reviewing my narrative of these adventures. It is accurate. Not a\\nfact has been omitted, not a detail has been exaggerated. It’s the\\nfaithful record of this inconceivable expedition into an element now\\nbeyond human reach, but where progress will someday make great\\ninroads.\\n\\nWill anyone believe me? I don’t know. Ultimately it’s\\nunimportant. What I can now assert is that I’ve earned the right to\\nspeak of these seas, beneath which in less than ten months, I’ve\\ncleared 20,000 leagues in this underwater tour of the world that has\\nshown me so many wonders across the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Red\\nSea, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the southernmost and\\nnorthernmost seas!\\n\\nBut what happened to the Nautilus? Did it withstand the Maelstrom’s\\nclutches? Is Captain Nemo alive? Is he still under the ocean pursuing\\nhis frightful program of revenge, or did he stop after that latest\\nmass execution? Will the waves someday deliver that manuscript that\\ncontains his full life story? Will I finally learn the man’s name?\\nWill the nationality of the stricken warship tell us the nationality\\nof Captain Nemo?\\n\\nI hope so. I likewise hope that his powerful submersible has defeated\\nthe sea inside its most dreadful whirlpool, that the Nautilus has\\nsurvived where so many ships have perished! If this is the case and\\nCaptain Nemo still inhabits the ocean—his adopted country—may the hate\\nbe appeased in that fierce heart! May the contemplation of so many\\nwonders extinguish the spirit of vengeance in him! May the executioner\\npass away, and the scientist continue his peaceful exploration of the\\nseas! If his destiny is strange, it’s also sublime. Haven’t I\\nencompassed it myself? Didn’t I lead ten months of this otherworldly\\nexistence? Thus to that question asked 6,000 years ago in the Book of\\nEcclesiastes—“Who can fathom the soundless depths?”—two men out of all\\nhumanity have now earned the right to reply. Captain Nemo and I.\\n'"
